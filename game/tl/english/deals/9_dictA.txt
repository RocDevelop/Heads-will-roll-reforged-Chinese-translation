Cassandra
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}By marrying Olivia and accepting the title of duke, you are moving into a completely new role for yourself.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}From a nameless militiaman running errands and then from a mercenary doing the dirty work, you have turned into a noble and distinguished person, for the first time in your life, becoming the one who gives orders rather than the one who carries them out.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}In peacetime, there was no point in even dreaming about something like that for a person of your origin. However, the war, as often happens, changed the fate in a bizarre way.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And where some found death and ruin, you, having walked a dangerous path and shed a lot of blood, found wealth.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And, it seems, happiness.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your relationship with Olivia is perfect, and you feel like you got everything you wanted from life.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue - success!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}For some time, thoughts of new adventures still haunt you, but when you wake up one morning, you suddenly clearly realize that you have nothing left to look for.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And in no place on earth will you be happier than here.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You spend the rest of your days in Rennes in the company of a loving wife, many children and loyal subjects who regularly toast your health in all the surrounding taverns.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 1 of 11.
{cps=50}During your search, however, Damietta manages to become your new home. Not least thanks to the relationship with Emma, who lets you know that she does not mind spending the rest of her life together.
{cps=50}The governor, who clearly hoped to marry his daughter to a more influential man, hesitates at first. But your status as a noble warrior, as well as the numerous services rendered to him, outweighs and he blesses the marriage.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (governor) - success!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}So, after traveling halfway around the world, you find an unexpected refuge here in Outremer.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Despite her image of a spoiled and flighty girl, Emma turns out to be a caring and loving wife - as well as an excellent mother for your many children.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You spend the rest of your days in Damietta, leading the defense of the city and stopping all attempts by the Mamluks to return the city and its surroundings to their control.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The fame you have won is so great that even years after your death, the name '[name]' will still be known to everyone in this part of Outremer...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Instilling fear in the hearts of some and giving strength to others.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 4 of 11.
{cps=50}As soon as you leave Damietta, groups of Saracen scouts appear on the horizon, carefully monitoring the movements of your squad and following on your heels like a shadow.
{cps=50}Their constant presence gives you a nagging sense of danger, and when the time comes to stop and set up camp for the night at sunset, you can hardly bring yourself to close your eyes. Even despite the numerous sentinels posted around the perimeter of the camp.
{cps=50}Despite the feeling of danger, you decide to try to take a nap in order to regain some strength after a hard day.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Despite extreme fatigue from the day's march, you do not close your eyes all night, preparing to repel a possible attack by the Saracens.

{cps=50}The second day of the journey brings another exhausting trek through the desert.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}But you do not share their confidence, and the feeling of danger does not disappear.
{cps=50}The sunset marks the need to set up camp again for the night...
{cps=50}The sunset marks the need to set up camp again for the night...
{cps=50}Despite the feeling of danger, you decide to try to take a nap in order to regain some strength after a hard day.

{cps=50}Despite extreme fatigue from the day's march, you do not close your eyes all night, preparing to repel a possible attack by the Saracens.
{cps=50}An attack that never happens.
{cps=50}The sleepless night that you reward your body with after a difficult crossing does not pass without leaving a mark on your health.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}All stats lowered by 2!
{cps=50}Waking up at night from some incomprehensible sounds, you immediately grab your weapon and jump out of your tent...
{cps=50}A dark figure with a bloody blade in his hand, standing over his body and already raising a weapon to strike another of your comrades, immediately rushes at you.
{cps=50}The Saracens clearly do not intend to fight to the end, and, as soon as things start to turn against them, they hastily retreat.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of the confusion in the camp, the remnants of the attackers quickly disappear into the darkness of the night.
{cps=50}After breakfast, the detachment cheerfully sets out on the road - the invigorated soldiers begin to sing, and you, for the first time in the last few days, notice a smile on your face. Things don't turn out that bad.
{cps=50}At first, this circumstance becomes a reason for joy.
{cps=50}However, after a few hours it becomes obvious that this joy was somewhat premature.{w} Because instead of a lonely group of scouts, an impressive detachment of Saracen horsemen in chain mail shining in the sun appears on the horizon.
{cps=50}After deploying into battle formations, you prepare to defend yourselves, but the Saracens are in no hurry to rush at you. Instead, once they get within bow range, they start barraging you with arrows and crossbow bolts.
{cps=50}One of them ends up being fatal.

{cps=50}Despite the Saracens' shower of arrows, Raymond of Bayeux, leader of your detachment, forbids anyone from leaving the tightly closed formation for fear of falling into the Saracens' trap...
{cps=50}Unable to force you to break formation and attack, the Saracen archers retreat, giving way to heavily armed warriors who launch their own attack on your positions.
{cps=50}Reluctant to let the Saracens safely shoot you and your comrades, you arbitrarily raise people to attack and charge straight at the enemy.
{cps=50}Having already gotten involved in the battle, you realize that by abandoning the formation and rushing forward you have fallen straight into the Saracens’ trap and are now about to find yourself surrounded...
{cps=50}Clenching your teeth, you continue to hold your position under fire.{vspace=5}And the Saracen archers, meanwhile, are launching another volley of arrows into the sky...
{cps=50}Fighting desperately, you manage to escape from the encirclement before the trap completely slams shut - and return safely.
{cps=50}Having successfully cut you off from the main forces left behind, the Saracens easily kill everyone one by one.
{cps=50}Having withstood the enemy's onslaught, you force them to begin a disorderly retreat.
{cps=50}Seeing that it is the Saracens who are now in a vulnerable position, Raymond decides to launch a counterattack.
{cps=50}Caught by surprise by your counterattack, the enemy takes flight. A quarter of an hour later, not a trace remains of the formidable detachment of Saracens.
{cps=50}Despite the confident victory that the battle ends with, you believe less and less in the success of the enterprise. Having left Damietta only a few days ago, the detachment has already lost a good quarter of its fighters before even reaching the walls of Damanhur.
{cps=50}Another similar skirmish with the Saracens would be enough to completely bury any hopes of capturing Damanhur - because there would simply be no one left to storm the city walls.
{cps=50}Fortunately, the defeat inflicted on the Saracens turns out to be significant enough to keep you safe the rest of the way. And, after several more days of grueling travel, you finally reach your goal.
{cps=50}Located near an oasis, Damanhur turns out to be an impressive-sized city with powerful fortifications that seem hardly inferior in impregnability to the bastions of Damietta.
{cps=50}With the trained eye of an experienced warrior, you immediately see that the size of your squad is not enough to encircle the city and take it under siege - Damanhur is too huge for that.
{cps=50}Having presented your thoughts at the military council, you convince Raymond that the only chance to capture the city is to seize it in a swift attack. Otherwise, with every day of delay, the forces of the defenders, bolstered from all around, will only grow - while your squad, vulnerable to attacks and deprived of reinforcements, will melt before your eyes.
{cps=50}Giving his people a week to rest and prepare, Raymond decides to storm the city.
{cps=50}The next week is spent in active preparation for the upcoming assault, mainly involving extraction of wood from the nearby oasis and construction of a large siege tower out of it.
{cps=50}And therefore, instead of a solid and reliable siege engine, you have to be content with what you got - a lopsided contraption of very dubious quality.
{cps=50}On the appointed day, having received the last instructions, you board the siege tower and slowly begin moving towards the city walls.
{cps=50}To successfully penetrate the city, you will need to capture key defense strongholds - four powerful bastions, each of which is well defended.
{cps=50}As soon as the siege tower approaches the city walls, a hail of arrows and stones immediately falls on it.
{cps=50}Having finally reached the fortress walls, you leave the tower and engage in battle with the defenders of the city...
{cps=50}Having captured a section of the wall, you prepare to storm the next target...
{cps=50}The remnants of the defenders, having lost faith in their strength, drop their weapons and run for their lives.
{cps=50}An hour later Damanhur is completely under your control.
{cps=50}Thus, despite all the odds, your poorly prepared campaign ends not in an inglorious death in the endless sands of Outremer, but in a triumph worthy of being considered the main achievement of your military career.
{cps=50}This brilliant victory finally cements your fame as a great warrior, while the rich spoils captured in Damanhur allow you to become one of the wealthiest men on this side of the Mediterranean Sea and never again be in need of money.
{cps=50}Raymond, who appreciated your contribution to the victory, invites you to stay in Damanhur and become his right-hand man...
{cps=50}Realizing that you have no place or person to return to, you accept his offer.
{cps=50}Over the next two years, you draw on your extensive military experience in Europe and Outremer to help Raymond build one of the most capable armies in this part of the world. And at its head you make several successful campaigns in the surrounding territories, winning resounding victories over the Saracen kingdoms.
{cps=50}And a year later, when Raymond of Bayeux unexpectedly and suddenly dies from an exotic disease without leaving any heirs, his inner circle of closest friends and followers chooses you as the new ruler of Damanhur.
{cps=50}During your reign, this already prosperous city will reach new heights of greatness. And the dynasty you founded will rule here for almost another hundred years before Christians will lose these lands once again — and this time forever.
{cps=50}But this, however, is a completely different story.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 11 of 11.
{cps=50}However, no wealth of Damanhur can make you forget why you went on this campaign, and you decide to return to Damietta to ask for Emma’s hand again.
{cps=50}Large military victories, increased reputation, as well as the considerable wealth that you have acquired make the governor more favorable, and he gives his permission for the marriage.
{cps=50}A poorly prepared expedition ends in failure, and somewhere out there, in the endless western deserts, your trace is lost.
{cps=50}How did you meet your end - no one knows.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 5 of 11.
{cps=50}From London you go to Greenwich to the court of Count Caldwell, where, to Alyssa's endless delight, you ask her father for her hand in marriage.
{cps=50}The knighthood, the status of a war hero, as well as the personal guarantee of the king himself leave old Caldwell no other options but to agree.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your wedding with Alyssa becomes a grandiose event, at which the entire royal aristocracy gathers, and so much ale and wine are drunk at the wedding feast that the wine cellars of the entire south of the kingdom are completely emptied.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Despite her wayward character and manipulative nature, Alyssa turns out to be a sincerely loving and devoted wife.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Together with her you live a long and happy life. A worthy gift for the difficult path you have passed. The path from a nameless peasant to an eminent knight and the protector of the throne, whose name will forever remain in the history of the kingdom.

{cps=50}After leaving the northern lands, you set off on a return trip. Heavy rains and cold weather give way to warm sunny days, making the return journey quick and comfortable.
{cps=50}However, the warmth from the sun could not be compared with the warmth that the presence of Lina, returning with you, gave you.
{cps=50}An unsuccessful campaign to the north, which did not bring glory to any of its participants, finally convinces Edward of the need to concentrate on solving numerous internal problems in the kingdom, which leads to several decades of peace.
{cps=50}Finding yourself out of work, a person like you has no choice but to start arranging his personal life...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your and Lina’s wedding becomes an intimate event with very few guests present. However, if one of the guests at your wedding is the king himself, is it necessary to invite anyone else?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}When, pronouncing vows of love and fidelity, you look into Lina’s eyes, you realize that you have never seen her so happy. And so beautiful.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Completely unspoiled by money and accustomed to working hard for every piece of bread, only after many months does Lina come to terms with the fact that now she is the mistress of her own estate and the wife of a famous knight.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}But having settled into this new life, she quickly turns into a real lady, whose manners, grace and refined taste could be the envy of any born countess or duchess.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Together with her you live a long and happy life. A worthy gift for the difficult path you have passed. The path from a nameless peasant to an eminent knight and the protector of the throne, whose name will forever remain in the history of the kingdom.

{cps=50}Cambrai.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}When the doors of the de Lambert estate open before you and you see Eva again, she smiles. As if you had never parted with her.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}De Roche, despite the peculiar circumstances under which you met him, pays tribute to you - both as an excellent warrior and as a worthy person. And, of course, as someone who once did not take his life.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Having received her father’s blessing, Eva happily becomes your wife.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And now, by a bizarre turn of the wheel of fate, the place where you once arrived with fire and sword for the sake of conquest and profit, now becomes your own home.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Here, surrounded by your wife and numerous children, you will spend the rest of your life - enjoying well-deserved peace and recalling with nostalgia the adventures you have experienced.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 6 of 11.
{cps=50}The decision comes naturally.
{cps=50}When you went to Outremer, you made a promise not just to return, but to return to her.
{cps=50}Before leaving the de Chatillon estate, you find out where Cecilia Grimaldi went and set off on her trail.
{cps=50}The picturesque plains of Southern France give way to the mountains and hills of Northern Italy. Dialects and accents change each other, but from the mouth of every girl you meet you hear her voice.
{cps=50}In Turin, where street artists paint her portraits, you are informed that she has left the city with the retinue of the Duke of Milan, and so you hurry to Milan.
{cps=50}In Milan, you hear people gossip about her beautiful outfits, which amazed the city with their beauty, but again you don’t find her.
{cps=50}From rumors you learn that the Venetian Doge paid for her services in gold, and the road leads you to Venice.
{cps=50}In Venice you see her reflection in the water of the canals. You smell her perfume in San-Marco Square.{w}{vspace=5}But she eludes you again.
{cps=50}Padua is followed by Parma, and Bologna by Ravenna. Days go by, and so do months.
{cps=50}But you keep looking for her.
{cps=50}And you find her.{w}{vspace=5}Because it couldn’t have been any other way.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}When your lips touch hers, everything falls into place once again.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You marry her in Florence - in an unfamiliar land, with a foreign language and customs. Infinitely far not only from your home but also from those places where you earned your name, reputation and fame.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}But none of that matters because she's right next to you again.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}This time for good.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 6 of 11.
{cps=50}Dreaming of a well-deserved rest after everything you've been through, you head to Paris, leisurely traveling from one inn to another.
{cps=50}She finds you about halfway down the road. In her usual manner, appearing absolutely out of nowhere.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She looks as beautiful as always: the same long raven hair, the same beautiful face with an eternal grin in her eyes and the same silver medallion on her graceful pale neck.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She speaks to you as if you had never said goodbye, and the feeling of a strange emptiness that has been gaping in your soul since Reno’s death suddenly goes away. You take a deep breath and feel better.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Realizing that this is apparently Fate, you then set off together, with the firm intention never to part again.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 6 of 11.
{cps=50}During your stay at the de Chatillon estate, you are accommodated in the guest wing of the mansion, which is almost filled to capacity with more than a dozen other guests - all kinds of doctors, physicians, healers and alchemists, who, judging by their accents and appearance, have come from all over Europe.
{cps=50}Not having much interest in their affairs, you don’t pay much attention to this motley rabble, preferring to focus on preparing for the upcoming journey.{vspace=5}Until one day you unexpectedly witness a scene that you least expected to see here.
{cps=50}In one of the corridors of the guest wing, a passionate argument breaks out between two very particular ladies.
{cps=50}Very familiar to you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Having exhausted the conversation, the girls disperse in opposite directions...
{cps=50}With the help of Cecilia, you develop a plan for the 'Avignon robbery' - secretly entering the pharmacist's residence on the outskirts of the city and stealing his saffron supplies from there. And also, in order to cover up traces, snatching other valuable ingredients and expensive medicines.
{cps=50}Contemplating the plan, you note that its success will depend almost entirely on your stealth, and therefore you should definitely leave any bulky armor and weapons behind - and go out on a job packed as light as possible.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New task received - [avignon_robbery.name!ti]
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cecilia’s voice becomes categorically stern.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your appearance brings a satisfied smile to Anna’s face. The intonations of her voice, however, in her characteristic manner, sound the same as always - as if you had never parted with her.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You briefly retell to her the events separating her departure and your departure to Paris.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You prefer not to interfere.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your armor is too heavy and bulky for a stealthy infiltration!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The size of your weapon can cause difficulties and hinder your actions!
{cps=50}You head towards Avignon...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your armor is too heavy and bulky for a stealthy infiltration!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The size of your weapon can cause difficulties and hinder your actions!
{cps=50}Having reached Avignon, you set up an observation position not far from the pharmacist's residence and spend some time watching, memorizing the patrol routes of the few guards and the habits of the servants.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!{vspace=5}Time lost: 3!
{cps=50}After waiting until midnight, you secretly approach the residence and successfully get inside.
{cps=50}After a short search, you manage to find saffron and also fill your bag to the top with other valuable ingredients and all kinds of valuables, making it look like a regular robbery.
{cps=50}Everything goes like clockwork.
{cps=50}But at the very last moment, luck fails you and you accidentally hit some large decorative vase with your weapon, which immediately falls to the floor with a loud thud and shatters into pieces.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Weapon size, Luck - fail!
{cps=50}The entire residence begins to quickly wake up and, instead of getting out calmly and leisurely, you have to run as you have never run in your life - as fast as you can and headlong.
{cps=50}As a result, you still manage to get out safely, but this crazy sprint consumes all your strength.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}As you leisurely make your way back, you catch the dawn almost halfway to the de Chatillon estate.
{cps=50}Enjoying the weather and whistling a song, you are thinking about what to do with your bag full of 'loot'...
{cps=50}Despite the controversy of your raid on the pharmacist's residence, you decide to preserve at least some remnants of honor and get rid of the loot by throwing the bag into the nearest ditch, where it will probably be picked up by some traveler or local peasant.
{cps=50}Scratching your head, you come to the reasonable conclusion that even though the bag's contents were not obtained in the most honest way, it’s stupid to just throw it into a ditch.
{cps=50}It makes much more sense to keep the money for yourself and use it for some good, useful and important endeavours. Of which you always have a lot.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 40!{vspace=5}500 florins received!
{cps=50}Everything is going well, and the return journey goes without incident. {w}Exactly until your path is suddenly blocked by a group of gangster-looking ragamuffins who appear from the roadside bushes and demand something very specific from you...
{cps=50}The bag of loot you brought from Avignon.
{cps=50}As you try to understand where the bandits got such concrete information about how you spent last night, they, without waiting for your answer, begin to surround you while getting a better grip on their weapons...
{cps=50}Having dealt with the bandits, you sit down at the side of the road to take a breath and search their pockets for something interesting...
{cps=50}However, just a few minutes later you find yourself rudely interrupted by a shout coming from another unknown person, clumsily emerging from the same roadside bushes.
{cps=50}Having dealt with the bandits, you sit down at the side of the road to catch your breath...
{cps=50}However, just a few minutes later you find yourself rudely interrupted by a shout coming from another unknown person, clumsily emerging from the same roadside bushes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You shake your head.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}He sighs disappointedly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Having emptied the canteen in one chug, the man wipes his mouth with the back of his glove and takes a deep, satisfied breath.{vspace=5}Enemy fatigue level lowered!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Having emptied the canteen in one chug, the man wipes his mouth with the back of his glove and takes a deep, satisfied breath.{vspace=5}Enemy fatigue level lowered!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The prospect of fighting the man does not really entice you, and you make the last attempt to talk your way out.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Surprisingly enough, instead of turning you down straight away, the man seems to be open to the idea of negotiations.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}At least to a certain extent.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The phrase, preceded by a dramatic pause, is too well-delivered to be a sudden improvisation.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}This obviously was not his first time saying that.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And, judging by the wide smile on his face, he is very much enjoying it.
{cps=50}As you return to the de Chatillon estate, you notice the extremely suspicious and, at the same time, perplexed glances of some doctors who for some reason hang around the gate - and the situation gradually begins to clear up.
{cps=50}Your suspicions are also reinforced by Cecilia, who, after listening to the story of your adventures with an open mouth, comes to the conclusion that one of her 'colleagues', apparently, overheard your conversation and tried to organize the interception of 'valuable cargo' with which you would return.
{cps=50}At first you want to perpetrate a reprisal immediately, but Cecilia, with her characteristic composure, stops you, urging you not to spoil relations with Bernard de Chatillon by shedding blood in his house. She also points out that it is hardly possible to figure out which of these snakes organized the ambushes.
{cps=50}This, however, seems to be the end of your troubles, since the medicine Cecilia has made with saffron does help to alleviate Henri's suffering a little - much to his father's delight.
{cps=50}Performing all these machinations and then watching how Cecilia intently prepares medicines while consulting recipes from time-worn tomes, you feel as if you were transported back to the camp under the walls of Cambrai - to where you first met her.
{cps=50}As you enjoy the grace of her movements, you suddenly become acutely aware of how much you have missed her all this time.
{cps=50}The irony that, after all this time, you met her again only to sail tomorrow to the distant shores of Outremer makes you chuckle.
{cps=50}When it's time to say goodbye, Cecilia, looking you straight in the eyes, makes you promise that you won't just return alive...
{cps=50}But return alive to her.
{cps=50}With your own life being on the line you decide to take no chances — and hastily retreat, leaving saffron behind.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige lowered by 1!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 25!

{cps=50}During these months, many of your comrades, tired of the enforced waiting and idleness, willingly transfer to the service of various local lords and seigneurs who are interested in the services of experienced soldiers and are ready to pay generously.
{cps=50}However, you are not tempted by their enticing offers.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers), Rank check failed!
{cps=50}Many soldiers respond to the offer enthusiastically, but you are not among them.
{cps=50}Having joined the French campaign against your will, you were satisfied at least because you simply managed to survive this war. And now you dreamed of returning home to a quiet and peaceful life, instead of getting involved in another dangerous enterprise.
{cps=50}You decide to stay in Dunkirk and wait for the evacuation to your homeland.
{cps=50}In the few months that this waiting takes, the already very modest supply lines are completely cut off.
{cps=50}Soldiers are basically forced to obtain food for themselves — by buying it from the locals with the money they earned during the campaign, poaching in the surrounding forests or even looting.
{cps=50}At first, the temptation to join looters or poachers is great for you as well. However, after a dozen or two soldiers who were engaged in such activities are caught and sent to a date with the executioner, such a desire somehow disappears on its own...
{cps=50}And after giving it a thought, you decide to refrain from breaking the law.
{cps=50}Even though the just-concluded war did not make you rich, a certain amount of florins still landed in your pockets — so you had something to pay for a piece of bread and a pint of beer.
{cps=50}Mere pennies that you have are only enough for you to somehow maintain life in your body by consuming crusts of stale bread and water.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[player_gold] florins lost!
{cps=50}Naturally, such a diet greatly undermines your health.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}All characteristics are decreased by 3!
{cps=50}Without a penny to your name, you have no choice but to starve, immediately spending any randomly acquired coin on a crust of stale bread.
{cps=50}By some miracle, you manage not to starve to death, but the damage done to your health is difficult to overestimate.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}All characteristics are decreased by 4!
{cps=50}In the end, the long wait is over, and you, among the last soldiers of the royal army, leave Dunkirk on a ship that is heading back to England.
{cps=50}During the voyage, many of your comrades suffer from seasickness, but you tolerate your stay on the ship well.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Coordination check passed!
{cps=50}During the voyage, you suffer greatly from seasickness.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Coordination check failed!{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 2!
{cps=50}During the voyage, you suffer greatly from seasickness.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Coordination check failed!{vspace=5}Toxicity increased!
{cps=50}On the way the ship is becalmed, but after a few hours of waiting, the wind nevertheless rises again, and by the evening you manage to arrive safely in Dover.
{cps=50}The creaking ship deck and the salt-smelling holds remain behind, and Dunkirk, Cambrai, and the royal camp tents are gradually turning into an increasingly distant memory.
{cps=50}It's time to start a new page in your life.
{cps=50}Since you have no relatives or acquaintances in Dover, you, despite the fatigue, intend to immediately go to your native Maidstone, which is about a day's journey from the south coast.
{cps=50}However, one of the soldiers who returned with you from France and happened to be a local warns you against it. According to him, the surroundings of Dover have always had a bad reputation as a dangerous place for lone wayfarers — especially for those who risk traveling after sunset.
{cps=50}Instead of going who-knows-where in the dark, he suggests that you join other soldiers and stop at some town tavern to celebrate your safe return from the war, spend the night in safety, and have a good rest. And then set off at dawn.
{cps=50}There is certain logic in his proposal, but the place where he suggests staying for the night does not inspire much confidence, to put it mildly...
{cps=50}On reflection, you decide to listen to the advice and not travel at night.
{cps=50}Except for the extremely sour beer, which suddenly turns out to be also really strong.
{cps=50}After a hearty dinner and a good drink, you get to your room on unsteady legs, fall on the bed, and sleep like the dead.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Fatigue level decreased to 0!
{cps=50}In the morning, when it's time to hit the road, you start packing and... with horror discover the loss of your purse with money.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[player_gold] florins lost!
{cps=50}An attempt to address the tavern owner does not lead to anything, as he just shrugs you off, blaming everything on your own drunken adventures yesterday.
{cps=50}When irritation gets the better of you and you start threatening him, he immediately calls for help from the town guard, which kicks you out of the tavern first, and then out of the town.
{cps=50}You have no choice but to head to Maidstone with empty pockets. The only weak consolation is that you do it well rested and during daylight.
{cps=50}His arguments do not convince you, and you prefer to set out immediately.
{cps=50}The consequences of this decision do not take long to manifest: in about the third hour of the journey fatigue takes its toll, and you, right on horseback, fall first into a light nap, and then into a full sleep.
{cps=50}A dream, out of which you are suddenly pulled by a heavy blow to the back of your head. Before you can figure anything out, a group of unknown people manages to pull you out of the saddle and then inflict a series of blows to your body and head.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Concussion!
{cps=50}After a few moments, you nonetheless come to your senses, pull out your weapon, and start desperately swinging it around, fighting off the attackers.
{cps=50}Soon, the attackers actually retreat, leaving you alone. After checking on yourself and making sure that there were no serious injuries and all the things were in place, you were already going to rejoice...
{cps=50}When you suddenly realize that the villains did not leave empty-handed — the purse from your belt was deftly cut off.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[player_gold] florins lost!
{cps=50}Fortunately, the adventures end there, and you overcome the rest of the road to Maidstone without any issues.
{cps=50}When the familiar spire of the town hall appears behind the nearest hill, it becomes warm in your chest.
{cps=50}Fortunately, you meet no robbers along the way, and the only problem you have to face is navigating an unfamiliar area.
{cps=50}After wandering around for a long while, you still manage to find the right road. And, when the familiar spire of the town hall appears behind the nearest hill, it becomes warm in your chest.
{cps=50}You have returned home.
{cps=50}As is often the case in small towns, absolutely nothing has changed here during your seemingly so long absence.
{cps=50}The guard at the town gates was still lazy, the innkeeper was fat, and the cat who lived in the inn was kind and fluffy. The tavern beer tasted as sour as before, and the audience inside was all the same dubious.
{cps=50}The streets were crowded with the same onlookers, and the merchants were still calling for potential customers' attention. Maidstone met you in exactly the same condition as it was when you left it for war.
{cps=50}The family was overjoyed at your safe return. All the numerous relatives and acquaintances gathered at the huge table set in honor of your arrival — beer and wine flowed freely, congratulations and toasts were raised, and you had to retell the details of your incredible adventures over and over again.
{cps=50}For a few days you become the center of everyone's attention and bask in the rays of this, albeit small, but real glory.
{cps=50}However, the feast arranged in your honor ends, numerous guests leave, and you have to return to reality, which, as it often happens, turns out to be harsh.
{cps=50}Things are not going well on your father's farm, and thus feeding another mouth off it — especially one as voracious as yours — is clearly not going to be possible. Therefore, joining your younger brothers, who work with your father, is not an option.
{cps=50}Having a roof over your head turns out to be not so simple either. Huddling in your parents' house, which even without you is already full of children, turns out to be extremely inconvenient and somewhat inappropriate, so you conclude without anyone's hints that you need to move somewhere.
{cps=50}After checking in with old acquaintances, you find an empty house on the outskirts of the town, rented out for a generally acceptable sum.

{cps=50}However, your creditors, sensing what was going on, notified the guards in advance, so you are caught leaving town and placed under arrest.
{cps=50}To pay off your debts, the town authorities decide to confiscate a part of your property.

{cps=50}About a month after your return to Maidstone, news reaches the town that a full-fledged conflict has broken out between the young prince, the son of the old king who died in the war, and the Parliament — and both sides are now hastily gathering troops.
{cps=50}Following this, soon a group of recruiters arrives in the town, who offer free citizens to join the ranks of the parliamentary army and protect the kingdom from the arbitrariness of the distraught prince.
{cps=50}Volunteers are promised a good salary, as well as food, equipment, and uniforms at government expense.
{cps=50}Not so long ago, when you sailed from France, you harbored great hopes about how wonderful your peaceful life would be upon returning home.
{cps=50}However, the first months of life in Maidstone bring only utter disappointment. Growing debts are putting more and more pressure on you, the need to search for new ways to earn money on a daily basis is tiring, and the boring routine work, which cannot be compared to those adventures that you experienced in France, brings only sadness and frustration.
{cps=50}Not recognizing yourself, you gradually begin to miss the war. Moreover, you yearn for dangerous tasks and risks, just as for the lack of need to worry about a roof over your head.
{cps=50}Or of need to pay off annoying creditors.
{cps=50}As a result, one morning you make a decision. After scooping up all of your belongings, you leave a note to your relatives and go to the nearest recruiting center, where you put your signature on a scroll of parchment decorated with an official stamp.
{cps=50}You were going to war again.
{cps=50}However, the first months of life in Maidstone bring only utter disappointment. The need to search for new ways to earn money on a daily basis is tiring, and the boring routine work, which cannot be compared to those adventures that you experienced in France, brings only sadness and frustration.
{cps=50}You gradually begin to miss the war. Miss the dangerous tasks and risks, loyal comrades and grandiose battles, war trophies and gold smelling of blood.
{cps=50}As a result, one morning you make a decision. After scooping up all of your belongings, you leave a note to your relatives and go to the nearest recruiting center, where you put your signature on a scroll of parchment decorated with an official stamp.
{cps=50}You were going to war again.
{cps=50}Reality, as it often happens, turned out to be no sugar, but you managed it. You found a place to live, paid off your debts, and even started earning some money.
{cps=50}So now that the war is looming on the horizon again, you prefer to give way to others. You've had your fair share already.
{cps=50}The blacksmith shop you have opened is becoming increasingly popular and, over time, it grows, becoming the largest in the town, and then in the whole kingdom.
{cps=50}At the same time, your skill also grows: starting with modest modifications for other people's armor, you, years later, master the blacksmithing craft and begin to forge your own high-class armor.
{cps=50}The long list of your clients includes first the local lords, and then other nobles from all over the kingdom.
{cps=50}The manufacture of ceremonial armor for, no less, the new king becomes the crowning achievement of your professional career.
{cps=50}Your own children also master the blacksmithing craft and become the successors of your business, securing the glory of great blacksmiths for your family.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 12 of 15.
{cps=50}The alchemical workshop you have opened is becoming increasingly popular and, over the next few years, you make a very decent fortune.
{cps=50}Your own spectrum of interests also evolves by that time and, having become rich, you spend a part of your money on creating a large alchemical laboratory where you could not only mix antidotes and coagulants for customers but also engage in serious scientific research.
{cps=50}You spend the next few decades unsuccessfully searching for the philosopher's stone, the elixir of eternal youth, and the panacea.
{cps=50}Even though the result of all these studies is disappointment, you accumulate an outstanding amount of knowledge, which significantly contributes to the development of medicine and many other sciences.
{cps=50}Your name is immortalized in history as the name of a great scientist of his time.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 13 of 15.
{cps=50}The craft workshop you have opened is beginning to enjoy increasing popularity and, over time, it grows, becoming a profitable family business.
{cps=50}You don't gain any special fame in the field of handicrafts, and by the end of your life you remain an ordinary craftsman from Maidstone - a respectable family man and a veteran of the French campaign.
{cps=50}However, you compensate for the lack of fame with simple everyday happiness — a loving wife and devoted children who become worthy successors of your family.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 14 of 15.
{cps=50}Scraping by with various odd jobs, you earn a simple living without any frills. You don't starve, yet you don't have any extra money either.
{cps=50}For someone, such a finale would be a sad disappointment, but not for you.
{cps=50}When you went to France against your will, you only dreamed of returning home safely and leading a normal peaceful life. And now that wish has come true.
{cps=50}Over time, you get a wife and children, and, after saving up some money, you move into a new, now your own, house...
{cps=50}Where you spend the rest of your days enjoying the peace and quiet.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 15 of 15.
{cps=50}Having found out that you hunted and collected herbs in Maidstone forest, representatives of the lord, on whose land the forest is located, require you to pay a toll of 56 florins.

{cps=50}When you get released, you are told that the next violation of the law will result in an even more severe punishment for you.
{cps=50}Coldness, dampness, and the disgusting diet of Maidstone prison quickly undermine your health, and every day you spend awaiting trial becomes a difficult ordeal.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}All characteristics are decreased by 1!{vspace=5}Toxicity increased!
{cps=50}Having found a number of aggravating circumstances that came out of nowhere in your case, the court imposes the death sentence, which is to be carried out the next morning.
{cps=50}Lying in the cell at night, you reminisce about your whole life, struggling to understand where and when you took a wrong turn.
{cps=50}And whether you had a chance to change something?
{cps=50}When you are already resigned to the inevitability of death, the cell door makes a lingering creaking noise and Rodolfo's squinting mug appears inside.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}These thoughts are swarming in your head and do not give you rest. You finally come to terms only the next morning, when, with a bag over your head, you put your neck under the executioner's axe.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You can hear the heavy blade rising and...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Obeying the unknown owner of the booming voice, the head of the town guard, who led the execution, hurriedly runs up to him and, in a trembling voice, introduces himself.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ignoring his bleating, the stranger continues.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After making another timid attempt to stop the stranger and receiving an even more rude refusal, the chief of the guard finally gives up and orders his men to obey and hand over everyone required.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}One of the guards begins to read out the names of the prisoners.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}One of them turns out to be yours. Still not believing your luck, you immediately start yelling, making it clear that it is you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Someone's hands take the bag off your head and gently push you towards a small group of other prisoners, gathered, apparently, according to that very list.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The stranger who just saved your life and made the chief of the guard tremble with fear turned out to be a hefty knight with fiery red hair and a predatory expression on his face.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Even though you all see him for the first time in your life, it immediately becomes clear to everyone that messing with him is not a good idea.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}So all of you, following his orders, hastily line up in a row.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}All of you, without a word, take a step forward. And just a few minutes later, you receive all the things that were seized during the arrest back and get on a large van that should take you to the military camp.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Thus, having barely managed to return home after one war, you end up right in another.

{cps=50}You are looking for a job, but there is nothing suitable so far...
{cps=50}Having found out about your military experience, one of the local farmers requests you to protect his cattle, which are regularly attacked by wolves.
{cps=50}Although the farmer promises a quite modest reward, the job itself also appears to be not the most dangerous since chasing wolves through the forests is not even close to storming Cambrai.
{cps=50}When you arrive at the farmer's plot, you arrange with his shepherd that if wolves appear, he will give you a signal with his horn.
{cps=50}After about an hour of waiting, the sound of the shepherd's horn is heard in the area and you come to the rescue...
{cps=50}Realizing that this time there will be no easy prey, the wolves flee.
{cps=50}You hear rumors that one of the wealthy Maidstone merchants is looking for a fencing coach for his young son.
{cps=50}The job promises to be both quite cushy and very well paid - so there are guaranteed to be plenty of people who want to get it.
{cps=50}Which means that a good first impression, which is known to depend on the appearance, may well be the key to success or failure.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [personal_trainer.name!ti].
{cps=50}You visit the merchant's house and offer him your services as a fencing coach for his son.
{cps=50}Your appearance makes a good impression and favorably distinguishes you from other applicants.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige check passed!
{cps=50}And when the merchant, on top of that, finds out that you are also a veteran of the French campaign, he immediately makes the final choice in your favor.
{cps=50}Your appearance does not make any special impression and does not distinguish you from other applicants in any way.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige check indecisive!
{cps=50}As a result, in order to make the final choice between several of the most promising candidates, the merchant decides to check everyone in action and arranges several test fights with wooden weapons.
{cps=50}Easily defeating all competitors, you win his favor and get the job.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Weapon skill check passed!
{cps=50}Although not without issues, you still defeat most of the candidates. In a duel with the last of them, things take a turn for the worst, however, by chance, the opponent slips several times, allowing you to deliver precise blows and score victory points.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Weapon skill check indecisive!{vspace=5}Luck check passed!
{cps=50}Based on the results of the fights, the merchant chooses you.
{cps=50}Your skills are not enough and you lose most of the test fights, losing any chance of getting the job as well.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Weapon skill, Luck check failed!
{cps=50}Your appearance makes a poor impression and puts you in a bad light compared to other applicants.
{cps=50}As a result, you get rejected almost immediately.
{cps=50}As expected, the job indeed turns out to be quite easy and not tedious, while the payment is extremely solid.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Time lost: 2{vspace=5}150 florins received!
{cps=50}Gradually settling in Maidstone once again after a long absence, you get up to date with local affairs, scandals, and incidents.
{cps=50}Most of them, of course, are of interest only for gossipers in the market or, at most, for lazy chatter over a pint of ale in a tavern. But there is also something that deserves attention.
{cps=50}So, a couple of months ago, people began to disappear in a nearby forest — hunters who were out for the game, peasants who went to gather mushrooms and berries, or children sent for brushwood.
{cps=50}Relatives of those who went missing have already tried several times to organize a search, but most of the time it did not lead to anything. And last time everything turned into a new tragedy.
{cps=50}The group that went on a search was attacked by some infernal monster, which in the blink of an eye devoured several people alive and turned everyone else into such a wild horror that they - having managed to escape and return - were unable to even clearly describe this fiend of hell.
{cps=50}From the semi-coherent nonsense that they rambled, it appeared that the attacking creature was horned, tailed, clawed, and fanged. Its eyes burned with fire, and its bloodthirsty mouth drooled with foam.
{cps=50}After these events, which caused a big stir in the town and its surroundings, the mayor of Maidstone announced a reward for catching and slaying the monster. However, the amount of those willing to go to the forest, for some reason, has noticeably decreased. Thus the promised reward has still not been claimed by anyone.
{cps=50}Unlike other inhabitants of Maidstone, stories about a monster dwelling in the forest do not make a big impression on you and you readily volunteer to deal with it.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [hunting_monsters.name!ti]!
{cps=50}The monetary reward, of course, attracts you, but the voice of reason turns out to be stronger and you decide to forget about this story.
{cps=50}As you wander deeper into the thicket, the tension rises.
{cps=50}Convincing yourself that there is nothing to be afraid of, you calm down a little.
{cps=50}And then there's a growl...
{cps=50}The fight is dragging on. Perhaps you should retreat to save your life...
{cps=50}Back home in Maidstone, in response to numerous questions as to who you met in the thicket, you, like all other survivors, find yourself capable of only the incoherent mumbling when describing the horror you have experienced.
{cps=50}As rumors about your military experience continue to spread further around, more potential employers are starting to take an interest in you.
{cps=50}Another job offer comes to you from the owner of one of the Maidstone inns, a well-known establishment in the area, which is universally popular and located on the outskirts of the town by the high road leading from Dover to London and further north.
{cps=50}The convenient location near this pulsating commercial artery, as it is not difficult to guess, provided the inn with a stable flow of customers — the establishment was almost always packed. But there have always been some problems with the quality of this clientele.
{cps=50}For every three honest hard workers or traveling merchants who stopped by for a drink, there was consistently at least one escaped convict, a rogue always ready to grab a knife, a raging drunkard, a bully looking for a fight — or, even worse, a whole company of such characters.
{cps=50}Bloody stabbings and brutal beatings were literally a daily occurrence in the 'House by the Road' — the name by which the inn was known throughout the area.
{cps=50}Given that, the establishment has always needed good security capable of maintaining order and harshly punishing its violators, but at the same time, staying reasonable and not turning the inn into a gladiatorial arena, from which the losers are carried out feet first.
{cps=50}Now the innkeeper is looking for a replacement for one of the bouncers, who beat to death several rowdy drunkards and created even more notoriety for the establishment which hasn't exactly enjoyed the best reputation already.
{cps=50}Considering that you are a man with military experience, this job should be fitting for you. If, of course, you are ready to follow the rules and act strictly with non-lethal methods.
{cps=50}This offer interests you and you agree to try yourself as a bouncer in the inn.
{cps=50}Delighted with your consent, the innkeeper promises you a decent wage after each shift and offers to start next Monday.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [roadhouse.name!ti]!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tutorial — Bouncer job.{vspace=5}The bouncer's task is to neutralize troublemakers using ONLY NON-LETHAL methods of influence. Unprovoked murders are a violation of the law and can lead to various punishments, including arrest and imprisonment or even execution.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}There are several ways to neutralize the opponent:{vspace=5}-to stun him;{vspace=5}-to fully exhaust him;{vspace=5}-to cause him three or more traumas;{vspace=5}-to bring his health down to 10%% (or lower, but not less than 1%%) of its maximum value.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The bouncer's weapon is a club. Bouncers are allowed to carry other weapons, but the use of any lethal weapon is prohibited by the owner of the establishment and may lead to dismissal.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A bouncer is forbidden to wear metal armor with the exception of chain mail hidden under his clothes.
{cps=50}This job doesn't interest you, and so you refuse the offer.
{cps=50}The first day at the new job goes pretty smoothly.
{cps=50}There are no particularly violent drunkards, and for those few who still start to mess around, shouting turns out to be just enough for them to immediately calm down.
{cps=50}By lunch you are already confident enough, and by dinner, you feel like a fish in the water.
{cps=50}The only serious issue is the unusual abundance of alcohol nearby, which becomes quite alluring.
{cps=50}By the evening, a noisy company of about half a dozen rowdy types who do not behave themselves particularly well even when sober, waltzes into the inn.
{cps=50}And then a third or a fourth.
{cps=50}As a result, by the evening you got pretty much plastered.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Drunk!
{cps=50}And unfortunately for you, just by the evening a noisy company of about half a dozen rowdy types who do not behave themselves particularly well even when sober, waltzes into the inn.
{cps=50}As their volume of consumed ale increases, the problems they create snowball: the company brazenly gropes waitresses, throws leftovers at other customers, breaks dishes, and in the end refuses to pay at all.
{cps=50}Making a last attempt to reason with the brawlers, the innkeeper comes out to the company and immediately gets hit on the head with a stool.
{cps=50}You're stepping in.
{cps=50}During the ensuing fight, you kill several people, for which, as the innkeeper warned, you end up arrested the same evening.
{cps=50}Despite the brawlers' attempts to resist, you throw them out of the inn one by one.
{cps=50}Thanking you for a job well done, the innkeeper readily pays you the promised amount.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}150 florins received!
{cps=50}Your second day at the new job starts just like the first one — without an incident.
{cps=50}Closer to lunch, one of the gloomy regulars of the establishment overdoes it with wine and begins to molest the waitresses.
{cps=50}You reprimand him.
{cps=50}Acting like he doesn't want to mess with you, the regular pretends to leave. But as soon as you look away from him for a second, he grabs a heavy bottle from the table and brings it down on your head.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Strength check failed!
{cps=50}At the last moment, you manage to dodge the blow.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility, Coordination check passed!
{cps=50}But you fail to dodge the blow in time...{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility, Coordination check failed!
{cps=50}And get a severe concussion, which, aggravated by previous head injuries, is very detrimental to your health!{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 2!
{cps=50}And get a severe concussion!{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Concussed!
{cps=50}Fortunately, the brawler is quickly twisted and thrown out of the establishment after being given acceleration in the form of a good kick in the ass.
{cps=50}After a few hours of quiet, a visiting knight ends up being a new source of problems, as he also overdoes it with alcohol and now refuses to pay.
{cps=50}Ignoring the waitresses reminding him about the money and rudely pushing the visitors away, the knight unsteadily heads for the exit.
{cps=50}In a last attempt to reason with him, you block his path and remind him that he must pay up.
{cps=50}After stating that {i}he forgives everyone he owes{/i}, the knight tries to push you out of the way as well. And when you refuse to let him leave, he grabs the hilt of his sword.
{cps=50}The guards who came to your aid help you to subdue the knight and escort him out.
{cps=50}The murder of a knight, committed in front of numerous witnesses, cannot be covered up, and the same evening you end up arrested.
{cps=50}Having pacified the knight, you finish the rest of the day in peace.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}150 florins received!
{cps=50}The third day, by tradition, starts in quiet, but this calm does not last long.
{cps=50}Around noon, a whole horde of soldiers from a detachment of some local lord barges into the tavern. Noisy and always cackling, they gradually fill the whole place with chaos, although, in general, they behave within the bounds of decency.
{cps=50}The real trouble begins some time later when another group of soldiers - from the Maidstone town guard - is slowly gathering in the tavern.
{cps=50}There is clearly some history between these two groups and, judging by the mutual causticity and hostility, it is far from pleasant.
{cps=50}When the amount of alcohol consumed by both sides crosses a critical mark, a disorderly brawl ensues....
{cps=50}During the ensuing fight, you kill several people, for which, as the innkeeper warned, you end up arrested the same evening.
{cps=50}Knocking out one brawler after another, you manage to stop the carnage and prevent the drunken soldiers from killing each other. But what you can't do is save the tavern from serious damage because during the fight it ends up being literally turned upside down.
{cps=50}The owner of the establishment, however, is not particularly discouraged, since, according to him, this is far from the first time when something similar happens in the 'House by the Road'. It will take around a week or a week and a half to eliminate the consequences, after which the tavern will open its doors again.
{cps=50}After paying you for the shift, he informs you that he will let you know when you can return to work.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}150 florins received!
{cps=50}Events are unfolding at a rapid pace. After spending about a day in a van rumbling over potholes, you, in the company of about half a dozen more people, arrive at a huge military camp near London.
{cps=50}Its size is impressive. If you estimate it by a glance, then the London camp seems to be at least twice as large as the siege camp of the royal army under the walls of Cambrai.
{cps=50}The number and power of the troops assembled here takes your breath away.
{cps=50}However, the first impression, as it often happens, turns out to be deceptive - at least partially.
{cps=50}After spending a few hours in the camp, you realize two things.
{cps=50}Firstly, it is filled with three-quarters of militias - random people, pulled from wherever possible and with very little idea as to what exactly they will have to do.
{cps=50}And secondly, most of the camp, which is occupied by the very same militia, is in a state of some completely unimaginable chaos.
{cps=50}There are some people scurrying everywhere, contradictory orders shouted loudly from all sides, crowds of lost recruits wandering from one commander's tent to another, and the newly unloaded wagons being reloaded - and right after that is done, the luggage is taken off them again.
{cps=50}The only island of tranquility in this raging ocean turns out to be a group of tents and marquees standing a little apart from the rest of the camp. In one of the standards fluttering above them, you recognize the banner of Roger's men.
{cps=50}Having somehow settled in, you learn about what is going on in general from conversations with other soldiers.
{cps=50}According to rumors, a conflict has broken out between the young prince, the son of the old king who died in the war, and the London Parliament. Unwilling to negotiate peace, the prince has preferred to send troops to the capital, which provoked a war.
{cps=50}It was not entirely clear as to what exactly the prince and the parliament did not share, for here opinions differed a lot. A popular point of view was that the prince was looking for a continuation of the war on the continent, wishing to complete his father's unfinished business. While, the Parliament, in turn, no longer wanted to finance this war, considering it senseless and unprofitable.
{cps=50}For common folks like yourself and your new friends, the prince's ambitions did not promise anything good either. The continuation of the war with the French guaranteed an increase in old taxes, as well as an addition of new ones, and, to top it all off, there was also a very real possibility of being thrown into the militia and sent under the walls of another Cambrai.
{cps=50}There were few people around you willing to go to Cambrai, so the sympathies of most of the soldiers were on the side of Parliament.
{cps=50}As for Count Canterbury, mentioned earlier by Roger, he was — as an experienced and authoritative person — elected by the Parliament as its protector and granted emergency powers.
{cps=50}You spend the next two days talking and reasoning on these subjects.
{cps=50}Remarkably, despite the chaos and confusion all around, provisions are being delivered to the camp without interruption, the treasurers are paying salaries, the intendants don't forget to issue weapons and equipment, and most soldiers — you included — are even run through the camp medic for a quick checkup.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have been assigned the rank of Militiaman.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have received personal equipment.
{cps=50}Early on the morning of the third day, the entire camp is alerted. Hastily lined up in loose battle formations, you march towards the prince's troops, which appeared out of nowhere and were now rapidly approaching the camp from several directions.
{cps=50}Being somewhere in the middle of the general formation, you can watch a heavily armed group of enemy knights and sergeants attacking the flank of your position, made up of recruits, and quickly putting them to panicked flight.
{cps=50}Forces, that are thrown to plug the resulting hole, which threatens to destroy the entire formation, include your squad.
{cps=50}The knights' attack is getting bogged down...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Your engagement in the battle allows stopping the enemy's advance. However, enemy reinforcements are also arriving, and the battle for the fate of your army's crumbling flank is flaring up with renewed vigor.
{cps=50}The new attack of the prince's men is led by five knights in armor decorated with gold and silver.
{cps=50}One by one, the knights are defeated.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}No amount of enemy efforts can make you flee, but your success pales against the backdrop of the events unfolding around you.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Command's favor increased by 2!
{cps=50}Provoked by the first enemy attack, the panicked retreat of some of the recruits by this time manages to engulf the entire army like a forest fire.
{cps=50}And those few units that are still fighting can no longer make a difference as the bulk of the army is fleeing.
{cps=50}Unable to withstand the onslaught, you abandon the formation and begin to retreat.
{cps=50}All around you, to the right and left, hundreds of other soldiers are busy doing the same thing. The formation with which the parliamentary army has entered combat is crumbling before your eyes.
{cps=50}The battle is lost.
{cps=50}The events of the rest of the day end up being a blurry series of shifting pictures for you.
{cps=50}Here you are running across a field, fleeing from enemy cavalry...
{cps=50}Hiding in some woods, catching your breath...
{cps=50}Wandering through the forest thicket at dusk...
{cps=50}Here you are dropping your gear and running across a field, fleeing from enemy cavalry...

{cps=50}Wandering through the forest thicket at dusk...
{cps=50}By the evening, you come out to one of the roads along which, from south to north, the remnants of the parliamentary army are stretched in an endless string.
{cps=50}Having joined one of the groups, you go with them...
{cps=50}The first days at the Oxford camp turn out to be painfully similar to everything you've already experienced at the military camp near London.
{cps=50}In a sense, things got even worse, since the usual confusion and chaos are now compounded by supply disruptions, salary payout delays, and a shortage of tents and marquees, because of which you have to spend two nights in the open.
{cps=50}Looking at all this, you are slowly filled with more and more skepticism about the future prospects of the parliamentary army in general and of your own, as its soldier, in particular.
{cps=50}Such a deplorable situation naturally gives rise to growing desertion.
{cps=50}Thoughts of unauthorized abandonment of the camp visit you as well, however, soon the situation begins to change rapidly.
{cps=50}After two nights in the open air, the intendants finally deliver tents and marquees, eliminating the necessity of shaking from the cold at night.
{cps=50}After a couple more days, the supply lines are slowly getting better. Food is now being brought to the camp on a regular basis, and of decent enough quality - at least compared to what you had to eat during the siege of Cambrai.
{cps=50}Following this, a few doctors arrive at the camp. They are, of course, mainly concerned with the knights and their men, but for a handful of florins they do not refuse to examine peasants as well.
{cps=50}Desertion is stopped, and many of those who managed to flee are caught and demonstratively executed.
{cps=50}The confusion and chaos are gradually wearing off as well - after the soldier lists are recompiled, everyone is assigned to squads with specific commanders.
{cps=50}You, along with a group of other veteran soldiers who participated in the battle of London and also have the experience of past wars behind them, are assembled into one unit.
{cps=50}Once he has new people at his disposal, he immediately begins to drill you, loading you daily with physical exercises and all kinds of training.
{cps=50}The last step towards restoring complete order and discipline in the camp is addressing the issue of salary payments. And, after a few more days, it is also resolved.
{cps=50}After lining up their squads, the commanders inform them that despite the capture of the kingdom's capital by the prince and his rebels, all contracts made on behalf of the London Parliament will continue in force.
{cps=50}Responsibility for their fulfillment is taken personally by Count Canterbury, who also assumes leadership over the army assembled by the Parliament.
{cps=50}For the duration of the contracts, the oath taken by the soldiers would now imply personal loyalty to the count.
{cps=50}Those who are faithful to the signed contract and loyal to the count will be paid the money promised for their service. Meanwhile, those who break their oaths, disobey the count's orders, or violate discipline in any way will be punished by immediate execution.
{cps=50}Thus, on the second attempt and after one utterly lost battle, the crowd of people gathered from all over the kingdom slowly began to turn into a real army.
{cps=50}Shortly after arriving at the Oxford camp, you finally receive your first proper assignment.
{cps=50}Roger gathers a group of savvy soldiers from his squad and orders them to go on a reconnaissance in the southeast direction - in the vicinity of a small town called Windsor.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [force_recon.name!ti].
{cps=50}Tired of waiting until you are finally ready to carry out the assignment, the command orders you to immediately head towards Windsor and reconnoiter.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Command's favor decreased by 1!
{cps=50}Following the order received, you move towards Windsor and spend about two days traveling around and carefully examining its surroundings.
{cps=50}Windsor is a small but extremely lively town located at the crossroads connecting the south and east of the kingdom with its north and northwest.
{cps=50}During your observation, you note a large number of both single wagons and large caravans heading towards London, loaded with military supplies.
{cps=50}The enemy, apparently, has actively been gathering troops as well as you, preparing for another battle.
{cps=50}It is noteworthy that Windsor itself, despite its obviously strategic location, does not appear to be well defended. The town has very impressive, albeit dilapidated fortifications, but there are hardly any men on its fortress walls and towers.
{cps=50}Watching all this, you gradually begin to understand why you were sent here on a reconnaissance mission.
{cps=50}Having completed all assignments from the command, you're ready to head back to Oxford....
{cps=50}The way back is uneventful.
{cps=50}The command thanks you for the successful completion of the task.
{cps=50}But before you head back, you decide to take advantage of the carelessness of the caravaners transporting their goods almost without guards, and attack one of them.
{cps=50}The guards of the caravan are quickly eliminated, and all the contents of the wagons are left for you to loot.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Command's favor increased by 1!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}The way back is uneventful.
{cps=50}The command thanks you for the successful completion of the task.
{cps=50}One morning, Roger gathers a part of his squad and hurries to the port city of Bristol, where he awaits the arrival of several merchant ships.
{cps=50}While the ships filled to the brim with cargo are being gradually unloaded, you and the other soldiers are assigned to guard them.
{cps=50}You honestly carry out the task you have received and try to guard the ships vigilantly.
{cps=50}For the most part, everything goes smoothly, but a few suspicious ragamuffins still try to get on board.
{cps=50}Fortunately, you are on your guard and stop the scoundrels.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility, Coordination, Luck check passed!
{cps=50}After unloading is finished, you escort the caravan of supplies back to the Oxford camp.
{cps=50}Roger, pleased that everything went smoothly, gives everyone a handful of florins for their good service.
{cps=50}Unfortunately, your vigilance is not enough and you miss several thieves, allowing them to first sneak on board and then abscond with the stolen items.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility, Coordination, Luck check failed!
{cps=50}The fact of the theft is discovered after returning to the camp. Not knowing who of those guarding the ships let the thief through, Roger decides to punish everyone.
{cps=50}Unwilling to expose your comrades to punishment, you tell Roger that the fault lies with you.
{cps=50}He recognizes your courage and hopes that in the future you will redeem your irresponsibility by blood. Otherwise, he threatens to personally drive you into the ground up to your neck with his hammer.
{cps=50}In the meantime, you're getting off with a relatively light punishment. Roger orders you flogged and released.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 2!
{cps=50}You remain silent and, as a result, subject two dozen innocent soldiers to an undeserved punishment.
{cps=50}No one knows that you committed the theft, but the situation still does not contribute to the development of friendly relations with colleagues.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 30!{vspace=5}Virtue decreased by 40!

{cps=50}You make an attempt to get aboard one of the ships and personally familiarize yourself with the contents of its holds.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue decreased by 25!
{cps=50}The plan works and you now have the opportunity to grab some of the things stored in the ship's holds for yourself.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility, Coordination, Luck check passed!
{cps=50}The plan doesn't work, you end up being caught and, as punishment for violating the order and abandoning your post, flogged and put in a pit for a few days.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility, Coordination, Luck check failed!

{cps=50}After finishing your business in Oxford, you decide to stop by one of the city's inns and have a pint of ale for the road.
{cps=50}In the establishment you are suddenly joined by a stranger who somehow knows your name and that you hold the rank of sergeant in the army of Count Canterbury.
{cps=50}In response to your questions, the stranger assures you that he is not your enemy and there is no reason to worry. And he found you only to make a favorable business proposal.
{cps=50}According to him, a criminal who has committed several atrocities and escaped justice by signing a contract with army recruiters is currently in your military camp. And, since Lord Canterbury has forbidden the extradition of suspected soldiers, even at the request of the sheriffs, he is now in no danger - at least until the war is over.
{cps=50}Chuckling to yourself at how a soldier in the active army could be 'in no danger', you ask the stranger directly - what exactly does he want from you?
{cps=50}In response to your question the interlocutor takes out a weighty purse from inside his shirt and drops it on the table in front of you with a clinking sound.
{cps=50}Some of the people affected by the perpetrator's actions are quite wealthy, well-connected, and empowered — and now they want revenge.
{cps=50}All you have to do is find his tent at night and slit his throat.
{cps=50}And the money is yours.
{cps=50}This situation immediately brings back memories of the de Roche story to your mind...
{cps=50}You never dreamed of a career as an amateur assassin, but the profession seems to have chosen you time and time again.
{cps=50}As you consent, the stranger describes in detail the appearance of the criminal and tells you which unit he belongs to, and therefore in which part of the camp he should be sought.
{cps=50}He also warns you that this person is extremely dangerous and advises you to be extremely careful.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [amateur_assassin.name!ti].
{cps=50}You refuse to work as an assassin and leave the inn.
{cps=50}In the camp, you think about the situation again...
{cps=50}And stay true to your decision to complete the task.
{cps=50}After waiting for the camp to fall asleep, you find the outlaw's tent in the dark and sneak in.
{cps=50}Silently getting close to his body, you slit his throat in one motion.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility, Coordination, Luck check passed!
{cps=50}It's over before it begins.
{cps=50}But at the most crucial moment, your skills fail you. A few careless movements cause a noise that immediately awakens your victim from sleep.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility, Coordination, Luck check failed!
{cps=50}...And instead of carrying out the task, you decide to report this to your command.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Command takes notice of you.{vspace=5}Command's favor increased by 1!
{cps=50}The fight is dragging on...
{cps=50}Having dealt with him, you hurriedly leave this part of the camp, hoping that no one has heard the noise...
{cps=50}The noise from combat wakes up the other soldiers. The fight is broken up and you both are placed under arrest for the duration of the proceedings.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Time lost: 5
{cps=50}Naturally, none of the commanders wants to waste time figuring out all the details of the conflict between the two soldiers, so the decision is determined, as they say, by eye.
{cps=50}You, as a more credible person, are acquitted, and your opponent is found guilty and immediately executed.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Rank, Prestige, Virtue, Luck check passed!
{cps=50}Neither of you are particularly trustworthy.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Rank, Prestige, Virtue, Luck check failed!
{cps=50}However, given that you are both listed as valuable veteran soldiers with extensive military experience, the command decides not to execute you both, but to severely punish instead: whip you with rods, and then put you in a pit for several days.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality decreased by 4!{vspace=5}Toxicity increased!{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!{vspace=5}Prestige decreased by 3!
{cps=50}The next day, after meeting the same stranger in the same inn, you receive the promised sum.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}250 florins received!
{cps=50}While looking at the goods displayed for sale in one of the stores, you strike up a conversation with the shopkeeper. It starts with a discussion of the quality of the armor, but, word by word, moves on to other topics.
{cps=50}The merchant turns out to be a pleasant enough person. You, in turn, also make a good impression on him.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue check passed!
{cps=50}After stating that he sees you as someone he can trust, the store owner asks you for a favor.
{cps=50}He expects delivery of new merchandise from one of his trading partners from the north any day now. The goods should be very valuable and very rare for the local lands.
{cps=50}The route of the wagon with the cargo, however, will run near Chippenham. And that place, as of recent months, has enjoyed a reputation of a most disgusting kind after the lord there had been deposed by his own peasants.
{cps=50}The shopkeeper's trading partner should send his men with the cargo, but an extra pair of hands in this situation would definitely not be excess. Especially if those hands would belong not to just anyone, but to an experienced soldier.
{cps=50}If you help him, he promises to give you a proper Scottish claymore for half price, several of which should come along with the new merchandise.
{cps=50}Chuckling, you state that you're not really willing to risk your life for a chance to BUY some sword.
{cps=50}Clearly hurt, and not so much by your refusal as by your derogatory comment about the claymore, the merchant says that you don't realize what an opportunity you're missing.
{cps=50}The claymore, he says, is a weapon of fantastic power that has no equal in this part of the kingdom. Once you get it, you will easily achieve victories on the battlefield...
{cps=50}You refuse again and repeat that the job the merchant is requesting you to do will require a real payment in the form of florins moving from his pocket to yours. Not the other way around.
{cps=50}As for the sword, the opportunity to buy it at a discount will be a nice bonus for a job well done.
{cps=50}Saddened, the merchant agrees to your demands: if you help him get the cargo intact, he will pay you for the work AND make a discount on the sword.
{cps=50}With a respectful nod, you acknowledge that his offer is now definitely worth considering.... Unfortunately, however, you have other things planned for this time.
{cps=50}With these words, you bid farewell.
{cps=50}You agree to help him.
{cps=50}After obtaining a swift-footed horse, you set off along the specified route towards the cargo, which is awaited by the merchant.
{cps=50}A couple hours into your journey, you come across an overturned wagon in a grove near Chippenham, whose surrounded owners are desperately fighting off a group of bandits...
{cps=50}The brigands are all killed...

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Having dealt with the bandits, you help the miraculously surviving escorts to return the wagon to the road and safely get to Oxford.
{cps=50}Roger conducts training sessions with the soldiers of his squad, training concerted actions and weapon handling.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Weapon talent points: +1.
{cps=50}Roger conducts drills with the soldiers of his squad, testing their physical skills.

{cps=50}The excellent results that you demonstrate make the command think about giving you a promotion...{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Command's favor increased by 1!
{cps=50}Rumors begin to spread around the camp that some of the forces will soon be sent to capture some important enemy town...
{cps=50}The marching order, as is often the case, comes suddenly.
{cps=50}After about a month and a half in the Oxford camp, Roger gathers his men one morning and orders them to prepare to march.
{cps=50}After a few hours, you make a forced march towards Windsor and reach the town by the evening.
{cps=50}According to the previously announced plan, the advance party, without arousing the suspicion of the town guards, would approach the gates that have not yet closed for the night and, with a surprise attack, seize them.
{cps=50}It would then give a sound signal to the rest of the squad, who would need to quickly rush into the town and capture it.
{cps=50}The plan works flawlessly and, after a quarter of an hour, you are already breaking into the town. The Windsor garrison, outnumbered and taken by surprise, can do nothing against the surprise attack and prefers to surrender.
{cps=50}The town is under your control.
{cps=50}The service is also getting more fun: instead of grueling and monotonous training, you are now engaged in measured patrolling of the town walls, as well as regular interceptions of caravans with equipment and food following through the vicinity of Windsor towards London.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Rank, Prestige check passed!
{cps=50}Caravaners, in general, don't hurry to resist and instead prefer to voluntarily give away the cargo to be looted in return for their lives and freedom.
{cps=50}But the service doesn't get any more fun. From the moment you arrive in Windsor, Roger assigns most of his soldiers to all sorts of construction and fortification work designed to strengthen the town's fortifications.
{cps=50}You end up among the 'builders'.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Rank, Prestige check failed!
{cps=50}The work turns out to be exhausting and, despite the good accommodation conditions, fatigue begins to accumulate.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}However, there are some positive aspects as well. Seeing that you have a serious talent for handwork, Roger appoints you as one of the fortification supervisors and also puts you on an additional allowance.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Crafting check passed!
{cps=50}But this happy period does not last long, and a week after you captured the town, the first enemy troops appear under its walls.
{cps=50}Seeing that the town's fortifications have been seriously reinforced, the enemy prefers not to storm Windsor at once, but, after putting the town under some kind of a semi-siege, to wait for the approach of reinforcements.
{cps=50}Over the next week, new enemy units arrive regularly under the walls of the town. Although most of them are militia of varying degrees of raggedness, there are also many well-armed warriors.
{cps=50}Having gathered a solid force, the enemy finally decides to launch a full-fledged assault.
{cps=50}You manage to repel the assault.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Despite the setback and heavy losses, the enemy is not about to give up his plans to retake Windsor and proceeds to an already full-fledged siege.
{cps=50}The supply routes between the besieged and the outside world are blocked, and, with the help of catapults and trebuchets, the town is now pelted with rotting animal carcasses, which quickly leads to the spread of diseases.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Toxicity increased!

{cps=50}At the same time, the siege camp begins to receive companies of mercenaries, which look much more menacing and hardened than the militias and soldiers who were sent to storm the town for the first time.
{cps=50}A couple of weeks later, when about a dozen new detachments join the besiegers, the enemy camp is enlivened, and the besiegers again go on the offensive.
{cps=50}In the first wave, just like last time, come militiamen with assault ladders....
{cps=50}The second assault, following the first, also ends in failure.

{cps=50}The second assault, following the first, also ends in failure.
{cps=50}The very next day, however, the atmosphere of joy quickly fades away as you watch the besiegers' camp from the fortress walls and see new troops arriving again and again. The enemy is clearly not going to retreat and admit defeat.
{cps=50}However, their losses are also taking their toll and the besiegers are in no hurry to send another batch of soldiers to the slaughter.
{cps=50}Things go quiet for about a week.
{cps=50}The situation in the city, meanwhile, is also gradually deteriorating. Thanks to the large supplies of provisions, there is no danger of famine yet, but the rations are gradually cut down, and it is no longer possible to eat your fill.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Vitality and Endurance decreased by 2!
{cps=50}One morning, as soon as you fall asleep after a night shift on guard duty, you are suddenly alerted and informed that the enemy is again assaulting the walls.
{cps=50}After quickly gathering and preparing for battle, you rush to the walls, however, along the way you encounter another messenger who, in a panic, reports that a group of mercenaries is breaking into the lower town through the sewer catacombs facing the river.
{cps=50}Taking a few other soldiers with you, you head to the catacombs.
{cps=50}The besiegers' attempt to enter the city through the catacombs fails.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}The situation on the battlefield is shifting. The battle might be soon coming to an end.
{cps=50}The besiegers' attempt to get into the town through the catacombs fails. After taking their dead and wounded, the mercenaries retreat...
{cps=50}Giving up on the idea of infiltrating Windsor through cunning, the prince's troops attempt another decisive assault a week later.
{cps=50}Addressing his men before the battle, Roger says that the enemy's forces are exhausted, and if this attack is also repulsed, they will have no choice but to admit defeat.
{cps=50}Gathering the remnants of your strength, you prepare to defend the town one last time.
{cps=50}Windsor stands.
{cps=50}The next morning, the enemy troops surrounding the town begin to gradually withdraw from their positions and leave. The siege was over.
{cps=50}That same evening, the first caravan with provisions arrives in Windsor and, for the first time in over a month, you eat to your heart's content.
{cps=50}Having received a messenger from Count Canterbury, Roger leaves the town, leaving one of his captains in charge.
{cps=50}Roger does not inform anyone about the reasons for his departure. The messenger also ignores the soldiers who pester him, but before leaving, he stops for a drink in one of the lively taverns, where he gets a little loose-tongued.
{cps=50}And an hour later, the same word is heard all over the town: negotiations.
{cps=50}Over the next two weeks, all sorts of rumors and news reach you from merchants and travelers passing through town...
{cps=50}Including that the young prince has suddenly passed away from a rare disease, and his army, torn by internal strife, has scattered.
{cps=50}It was now not entirely clear as to what awaited the kingdom. However, questions about the fate of the crown were quickly overshadowed by the arrival of the official treasurer, who paid you under the contract and announced that your service, as well as the war, was now officially over.
{cps=50}After receiving a weighty purse of coins and freedom, you, as befits any normal person, prefer not to bother thinking about politics and finally get down to organizing your own life.
{cps=50}You initially plan to take a week's break in Windsor and then head back to Maidstone. However, life in Windsor appears to be surprisingly pleasant, and so you are in no hurry to leave.
{cps=50}In a town that is actively recovering from a siege, workers are always needed and there is no shortage of ways to earn money. Therefore, florins literally flow into your pockets on their own.
{cps=50}Thanks to the various connections and acquaintances you have made during your stay here, it is easy to find a place to live. And the numerous friends you have made, both among soldiers and townspeople, brighten up your life.
{cps=50}The thought of new adventures still crosses your mind for a while, but your undermined health and countless wounds received during this and previous campaigns put an end to the idea. So, after some consideration, you decide to settle down here in Windsor.
{cps=50}In search of a lucrative option to invest the money earned in the war, you become a business partner of one of the town's merchants and, little by little, retrain as a businessman.
{cps=50}After another year, you marry his daughter and have children. And in two more years, you purchase your own small mansion in the upper town.
{cps=50}Truly, God works in mysterious ways.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 16 of 19.
{cps=50}One evening, just as you return from a hard day's work, you are met with an unpleasant surprise at home.
{cps=50}An unpleasant surprise in the form of two uninvited guests who somehow got inside the house and, without any secrecy, settled right at the dining table.
{cps=50}You reach for your weapon as you see them, but the strangers show no hostility.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You don't want to listen to them and demand they get out immediately.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}At first they try to argue, however, when you start threatening them with a weapon, they reluctantly comply and leave your house.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Rodolfo, who was clearly waiting for his turn to open his mouth, begins to speak passionately.
{cps=50}Mysterious Duncan doesn't keep you waiting long. A few days later, Rodolfo again secretly visits you at night and this time you leave your house with him.
{cps=50}Once out of town, you take a short break on a hill — just in time to enjoy the sight of the flaming building of the Maidstone moneylender guild.
{cps=50}'Jones is a scoundrel, of course, but he knows his business,' Rodolfo sneers, and you continue on your way.
{cps=50}You spend the whole night on the road and by morning arrive at a well-equipped forest camp, where you expect to finally see Duncan firsthand.
{cps=50}However, events unfold differently. After bringing you to the place, Rodolfo informs you that the next step will be a test of your skills and loyalty. And only if it is passed successfully, you will have a personal meeting with the rebel leader.
{cps=50}After you answer in the affirmative, Rodolfo introduces you to the details of the business at hand. The next morning you are to take part in an ambush on a knight among the men of Count Caldwell, lord of the Greenwich Manor and Duncan's sworn enemy.
{cps=50}The old count, as well as his young sadistic daughter, are well known throughout the area for their cruelty both to the rebels, whom they eradicate without pity, and to their own peasants, whom they hold in a tight grip and force to pay through the nose.
{cps=50}Considering, according to Rodolfo, what kind of people they are, there is no reason to pity them or those on their payroll, who earn their bread by taking it from others.
{cps=50}The next morning you, with a group of about a dozen well-armed rebels, ambush a road at the edge of the forest...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Having almost lost your head a few minutes earlier from the swings of the knight's sword, you can't quite completely agree with these words. However, you prefer to keep your thoughts to yourself.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Rodolfo, meanwhile, leans over to the bleeding knight and rips a jeweled chain from his neck.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Rodolfo tosses the chain aside squeamishly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The remnants of life are rapidly leaving the knight's body, trickling out in streams of blood through his many wounds. But he can still speak, though it is barely audible.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The knight's light blue eyes stare unblinkingly into Rodolfo's face, who responds in kind - piercing the knight with a look full of disgust.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}To the cheers of Rodolfo and the other Duncan's men, you finish the knight with a powerful blow.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As his severed head rolls into a nearby ravine, someone's weighty hand comes down on your shoulder.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You raise your weapon over the knight's head, but you can't bring yourself to make the last move.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}At that moment, a figure that appeared from somewhere behind you with a single slash of his blade deftly cuts off the knight's head, which, to the cheers of everyone nearby, rolls into a nearby ravine.
{cps=50}Having successfully passed Duncan's test, you settle in the forest camp with the rest of his squad.
{cps=50}Life in the camp is not much different from that led by soldiers of the royal army under the walls of Dunkirk or Cambrai.
{cps=50}In many ways, it is even less organized. For example, there are no healers among Duncan's people, so anyone suffering from illness or disease is left to fend for themselves.
{cps=50}This list of disappointments is supplemented by the missing salary payments, as well as remarkably disgusting food.
{cps=50}With these thoughts in mind, you enter the new part of your life.
{cps=50}At the specified hour, the camp is set in motion. All those able to hold arms are equipped and divided into small detachments, under the command of Rodolfo, Jones, and the other field commanders.
{cps=50}After making sure that everyone is gathered and assigned to squads, Duncan addresses his people with a speech.
{cps=50}Setting out at sunset, the squad reaches the outskirts of the Caldwell estate around midnight.
{cps=50}Perfectly fortified, it seems like a completely invulnerable target that would require at least a small army with a couple of siege machines to capture.
{cps=50}What exactly Duncan is counting on is unclear. However, he acts confidently and, leaving most of his men behind in hiding, without hesitation moves out with a small detachment straight to a small side entrance in one of the towers and...
{cps=50}Simply knocks, tapping out some secret combination.
{cps=50}To your infinite surprise, the door swings open.
{cps=50}There are two twitchy-looking men behind it, who exchange a few words with Duncan and, after receiving a jingling pouch from his hands, make a swift retreat toward the nearest grove. They kindly leave the door open.
{cps=50}The defenses of the Caldwell estate appear to be breached without a single drop of blood spilled.
{cps=50}Following Duncan's commands, you swiftly make your way inside and attempt to break through to the main gate, the opening of which will let the bulk of the squad inside...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}You open them and let the bulk of the squad inside.
{cps=50}The fate of the defenders appears to be sealed, but they still attempt a desperate counterattack.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}After brutally dealing with the owners of the estate and stuffing several bags full of all kinds of goods, Duncan's men set it on fire.
{cps=50}Thus, the story of the Caldwell house ends, cut short by a gang of peasants, bandits, and ex-soldiers.
{cps=50}As someone who has also had to deal with the ubiquitous fees and taxes, at the expense of which the rich profited off the common people, you can't help but feel something akin to a shadow of satisfaction.
{cps=50}However, at the same time you are haunted by the realization that you have just looted and then burned, along with its owners, an estate belonging to people you did not know anything about until recently and at whose hands neither you nor your friends nor your family have suffered.
{cps=50}What exactly did you take revenge for and why exactly was it them?
{cps=50}Back at the camp, Duncan's men throw an epic bash in an atmosphere of universal jubilation. Watching their genuine fun from the sidelines and still suffering from internal reflections, you can't think of anything better than getting drunk with everyone.
{cps=50}But before you can do so, someone's hand comes down on your shoulder again.
{cps=50}Your conversation with Duncan leaves you with mixed impressions, but the events of the following weeks make you look at his position differently.
{cps=50}The destruction of the Caldwell house brings rejoicing to the surrounding peasants, who are now freed from the need to pay various taxes and fees, and your entire squad turns into local heroes.
{cps=50}Leaving the forest camp with its dugouts and huts behind, you move to one of the remote villages, where you set up, not without the help of grateful peasants, a much more comfortable camp.
{cps=50}Regular earnings also appear — filling the power vacuum that occurred after the disappearance of the Caldwells, Duncan finds himself forced to take on some functions to maintain order in the neighborhood. For that, of course, your squad starts to receive small but regular sums of money.
{cps=50}However, no one is going to stop at what has been achieved, and further plans of the squad are supposed to be discussed at the council...
{cps=50}Having substantially improved its financial situation, Duncan's squad leaves its base near Greenwich and moves to Chippenham.
{cps=50}The region, engulfed by peasant uprisings, welcomes your squad with open arms, seeing you as their saviors.
{cps=50}Once settled in this new place, you quickly set up a camp and recruit under a hundred new fighters from among the rebels.
{cps=50}The saved-up money comes in handy and makes it possible to provide this growing army with both food and equipment.
{cps=50}Seeing what the florins collected in Greenwich went for, Rodolfo, who has been taking that decision very hard, finally begins to feel better.
{cps=50}Duncan and Jones, meanwhile, come up with a simple-minded, but, as it turns out, very effective plan to deal with the marquis.
{cps=50}When his men go on another punitive expedition, your squad, in collusion with the local peasants, lures them into a trap...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}The marquis' surviving men, exhausted and wounded, drop their weapons and surrender.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Taking advantage of the element of surprise and numerical advantage, Duncan's men without much difficulty inflict a crushing defeat on the marquis's detachment, which consists of professional warriors...
{cps=50}Having deprived the marquis of a substantial part of his army, Duncan, wasting no time, leads his squad to storm Chippenham Castle itself, which has just lost most of its defenders.
{cps=50}This time you can't rely on traitors to open the gates from the inside, and you have to storm the castle the old-fashioned way - with waves of infantry with assault ladders.
{cps=50}As one of Duncan's few men with experience in storming fortresses, you lead the attack...
{cps=50}By capturing the walls, you force the defenders to retreat deep into the castle...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Unable to withstand your onslaught, the defenders leave the walls and retreat deep into the castle...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}However, the outcome of the battle is predetermined, and, by the evening, the castle is completely under Duncan's control.
{cps=50}The personal standard of the marquis flying on the spire is torn off and thrown down. The marquis himself, who was captured wounded, is first publicly tortured and then executed, to general rejoicing.
{cps=50}Holding the severed head of the marquis in his hands, Duncan proclaims to the peasants gathered around the abolition of all taxes, tolls, and fees, eliciting a sea of cheers.
{cps=50}Standing next to smiling Rodolfo and watching the crowd raving with joy, you see a single tear rolling down his cheek.
{cps=50}Having captured the residence of the Marquis of Chippenham intact, Duncan decides to turn it into his temporary base.
{cps=50}The surviving members of the squad, who until recently slept first in forest dugouts and then in rough peasant huts, are now accommodated on spacious down featherbeds.
{cps=50}The marquis's private chambers remain empty at first, as Duncan demonstratively refuses to occupy them, preferring to stay with the rest of his people.
{cps=50}To everyone's surprise, the vaults of the castle do not contain any untold riches. Financial affairs at the Marquis, apparently, were not the best, so your booty ends up being a considerable, but all in all not particularly impressive sum.
{cps=50}Duncan pays most of this money to his men as a bonus and a reward for their courage in the last battles.
{cps=50}Rodolfo turns out to be unhappy with this allocation of money despite the perfectly logical arguments that the squad members need to spend money on equipment — especially now that the squad has begun to move from guerrilla tactics to things like full-fledged castle assaults.
{cps=50}Unconvinced by these arguments, Rodolfo gives out his money to the local peasants and the poor, staying in the same patched gambeson and rusted chain mail as before.
{cps=50}Rodolfo's grumbling, however, does not spoil the mood of the rest of the squad, who, for the first time in a long while — and for many it was for the first time in their lives — found themselves in comfortable conditions, with money, and in the status of heroes.
{cps=50}Everyone enjoyed the well-deserved rest and captured loot.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Duncan has made you one of his confidants!{vspace=5}You have been promoted to Sergeant.
{cps=50}Grabbing your gear, you follow Jones, who, while gathering more men along the way, leads you to a vast near-castle settlement bordering the marquis' residence on several sides.
{cps=50}A real battle breaks out in the streets of the settlement between several groups of peasants, who, armed with whatever they had at hand, fight each other to the death.
{cps=50}Rodolfo, who arrived on the spot a little earlier, is already trying to restore order with his fists and the hilt of his sword. You join him without wasting time.
{cps=50}After asking people what's going on, you learn that the cause of the conflict was a dispute between the inhabitants of two nearby villages about whose turn it was this time to put their wares up for sale in the trading area of the near-castle settlement.
{cps=50}In the past, such matters were regulated by the marquis' men, but now they are gone and there is no one to settle the dispute.
{cps=50}Over the next month, these incidents begin to happen with alarming frequency. Not two days go by without Duncan's men having to go to one place or another to restore order or settle disputes that quickly and regularly escalate into bloody stabbings.
{cps=50}Meanwhile, until recently you had indisputable authority and were seen as saviors by all the local residents, but now the situation is changing.
{cps=50}The merchant you ordered to give way to a competitor because it was his turn to occupy the square. The peasants you told to get out of their neighbors' illegally occupied territory. The sons whose father's skull you cracked open in one of the fights in an attempt to pacify him...
{cps=50}The number of those discontent with Duncan and his men grows daily, and that dissatisfaction breeds fury.
{cps=50}And now it is Duncan's men who get ambushed in the woods, it is their backs that are stabbed with daggers and their sides that are shot at with crossbows.
{cps=50}Local recruits who have recently joined the squad are actively deserting, taking with them the received equipment or anything of value from the castle.
{cps=50}These deserters, along with the bandits and marauders who have joined them, quickly band together and go rob highways or try to impose tribute on any places from which they can profit.
{cps=50}The peasant war that raged in Chippenham in the days of the old marquis is beginning to flare up again.
{cps=50}Faced with the fact that peasants from all over the area no longer bring you food as a token of their gratitude, the squad loses men killed and wounded every day, and utter chaos and lawlessness reign outside the castle walls, Duncan is forced to radically reconsider his behavior.
{cps=50}Similar to Greenwich, small taxes are now being collected from the territories previously belonging to the Marquis of Chippenham, which are used to buy provisions and to recruit new men for the squad. Since relations with the locals are not at their best, Duncan has to turn to the services of minor mercenary companies.
{cps=50}Well-armed and disciplined, they help, albeit not without bloodshed, to restore some semblance of order.
{cps=50}The necessity to regularly collect taxes from a large territory, recruit, train, and provide for the new fighters to the squad, pay for the services of mercenaries, as well as regularly receive delegations from local people and solve their problems has a strange effect on the castle.
{cps=50}Once again, as in the days of the marquis, it begins to be filled with scribes and accountants, caretakers and managers, messengers and cooks.
{cps=50}After an unsuccessful attempt on Duncan's life, organized by one of the rich merchants, the castle's security is strengthened and, as in the time of the marquis, it becomes impossible for an outsider to get inside.
{cps=50}The costs of maintaining this entire sprawling apparatus force Duncan to reluctantly, in addition to the taxes already levied, return a part of the tolls and duties that were collected during the marquis' time.
{cps=50}At the council, when Duncan announces this decision, Rodolfo, who was already becoming more and more disgruntled with each new week, becomes furious.
{cps=50}But Duncan remains adamant.
{cps=50}When the Sheriff's posse shows up, Chippenham Castle is already on full defense.
{cps=50}Fortified walls, squads of archers and crossbowmen on towers, vats of boiling tar and food supplies for a long siege.
{cps=50}Duncan's obviously not going to give up the castle for nothing.
{cps=50}The Sheriff, who apparently did not expect to see that, does not hurry with the assault and sends negotiators to the castle several times, offering the defenders to pay off.
{cps=50}However, both sides fail to find a common ground, since Duncan agrees to pay only a token sum, while the Sheriff demands very substantial concessions.
{cps=50}Two days after his appearance under the castle walls, still unable to reach an agreement, he finally gives the order to storm the castle.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Under the pressure of the storming troops, the defenders of the castle leave one of the towers and the sheriff's men manage to break into the castle...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}The Sheriff's death undermines the morale of the attackers and they begin to retreat, despite being close to victory.
{cps=50}A quarter of an hour later, the castle is once again completely under your control, while the remnants of the Sheriff's men hurry off in the direction of the siege camp.
{cps=50}That same evening, a feast is held in honor of the victory, at which someone raises a toast — To Duncan! To the new Marquis of Chippenham!
{cps=50}The following months finally cement this new state of affairs. Duncan increasingly assumes the role of marquis, while you find yourself in the position of pretty much one of the captains of the guard under him.
{cps=50}As someone with extensive military experience, you take on the duties of guarding the castle and training new recruits.
{cps=50}Your relationship with Duncan remains good, however, as time goes on, it becomes more formal.
{cps=50}Duncan himself is gradually becoming fully accustomed to the role of the marquis. So much so, that during feasts he begins to speak apprehensively about the vague future that awaits him after the end of the war for the royal throne.
{cps=50}As soon as the 'real' nobles finally sort themselves out, they will surely turn their attention to him. An impostor who has seized by force what does not belong to him.
{cps=50}And then, it would not be the Greenwich Sheriff's posse that would go under the walls of Chippenham.
{cps=50}Looking for a way out of this situation and seeing how both warring factions are actively seeking any allies who can tip the scales in their favor, Duncan decides to offer his help to one of the parties — the one that will agree to do him a favor for a favor.
{cps=50}Thus, an envoy from Earl Northampton — the right-hand man of the young prince, the son of the deceased king, appears in Chippenham.
{cps=50}The details of the conversation that took place between the earl's representative and the new Marquis of Chippenham are not known to you. However, even before the messenger has time to leave the castle, Duncan summons you.
{cps=50}Drowning in mud, the siege camp near Windsor immediately evokes your worst memories of being under the walls of Cambrai.
{cps=50}The gloomy and disgruntled faces of the soldiers, the wounded groaning in the infirmary, the area in front of the fortress walls strewn with corpses, and, looming over it all, the powerful bastions of the besieged town, looking completely impregnable.
{cps=50}After looking at this picture with a sad look, you go in search of command.
{cps=50}You find the earl in the headquarters tent in the center of the camp, where he is sitting at a massive table, sorting through some piles of parchments, all the while listening to a servant who, stammering now and then, reads out letters to him.
{cps=50}At the appointed hour, you march in battle formation to the walls of Windsor.
{cps=50}Simultaneously with yours, several other units are also attacking the town from other directions.
{cps=50}After overcoming an open space under a hail of arrows and bolts and receiving just one slight wound, you reach the moat surrounding the walls.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Health lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Your men quickly put ladders against the wall and begin to climb, but they are immediately bombarded by torrents of boiling tar.
{cps=50}Its spray reaches you as well, leaving some terrible burns.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 2!
{cps=50}Taking advantage of your hitch, the defenders push the ladders off the wall and, peeking out from behind cover, one by one take out almost all of your men with accurate crossbow shots.
{cps=50}Seeing that the attack fails before it has even begun, the defenders of Windsor make a foray outside, sending a small group of warriors to the moat to finish off the survivors...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Having fought off the defenders' counterattack and come to your senses, you look back towards the camp and listen, but you don't see or hear the signal to retreat.
{cps=50}Which means that the assault goes on.
{cps=50}Seeing that the defenders have used up their bolts and tar and are now throwing mostly only insults in your direction, you put a fallen assault ladder against the wall and climb up...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}The assault ends in failure.
{cps=50}Having lost most of your detachment and received a lot of injuries and traumas, you spend the next two weeks licking your wounds.
{cps=50}To the earl's credit, it is worth noting that he does not involve your men in any jobs or activities, allowing them at least a little recovery.
{cps=50}However, exactly two weeks later, as soon as the next replenishment arrives at the siege camp, a new assault is immediately organized.
{cps=50}This time, you are tasked with infiltrating the town through the sewer catacombs facing the river.
{cps=50}After waiting until the assault groups rush to the walls and divert the defenders' attention, you and a small group of soldiers sneak through the river bulrush to the narrow entrance to the urban catacombs and plunge into their stench...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}The attack progresses successfully and you almost manage to reach the exit to the lower city...
{cps=50}But seeing your advantage, the defenders first pile up the exit to the town with rocks and then start making smoke, causing you to suffocate and preventing you from clearing the rubble.
{cps=50}You have to retreat.
{cps=50}In the camp you are given about two weeks to rest as usual. During this time, the town is actively littered with the carcasses of slaughtered animals and bombarded with incendiary shots from ballistae and trebuchets, causing fires.
{cps=50}But all that pales in comparison to the main thing — the engineers finally finish the construction of several siege towers.
{cps=50}As soon as another replenishment arrives at the camp, the earl, as if by tradition, immediately announces a new assault.{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level decreased.
{cps=50}Invulnerable to arrows and bolts, the siege engine safely takes you directly to the town walls, and you attempt to capture the town for the third time...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}After driving the exhausted defenders off the walls without much difficulty, you finally break into the town. Seeing your success, the earl sends his knights to assist you...
{cps=50}As is often the case, the laurels for the successful capture of the town don't exactly go to those who contributed the most to the victory.
{cps=50}Despite being the first to jump out of the siege tower onto the fortress wall, being the first to enter the town, and personally slaughtering more than a dozen enemy soldiers, you, however, end up deprived of any rewards.
{cps=50}They reward knights and their squires, siege engineers and lords who have sent their troops under the walls of Windsor. Reward anyone but you.
{cps=50}Having fulfilled your part of the agreement between Duncan and the earl, you get the right to leave the active army and return to Chippenham with your men.
{cps=50}However, there were no men left in your ranks for a long time by now.
{cps=50}You do not care much about the further fate of the kingdom or that of the lords fighting with each other, just as they absolutely do not care about yours.
{cps=50}When you return to Chippenham alone, the town looks to you pretty much the same as it was when you left. Except for one small detail.
{cps=50}Duncan's name is not heard anywhere anymore and is not mentioned by anyone.
{cps=50}Yet the phrase 'Marquis of Chippenham' is very common.
{cps=50}After waiting your turn for an audience with the marquis, you find Duncan exactly as you left him — in the marquis' formal attire, with a glass of wine in his hand and an infinitely satisfied expression on his face.
{cps=50}As Jones once wisely remarked, it wasn't him who came up with the rules by which this world exists.
{cps=50}It wasn't him who decided that the peasants freed from the power of the liege lords would slit each other's throats and look for a new strong hand, a ring on which they could kiss.
{cps=50}It wasn't him who decided that having once slept on silk sheets, no one would want to return to the frozen dugouts again.
{cps=50}It wasn't him who decided that no one would want to drink ale from roadside inns again after trying the exquisite wines from Champagne and Burgundy.
{cps=50}It wasn't him who decided that reigning in Hell is still just a little better than serving in Heaven.
{cps=50}It wasn't him who decided that the world would work this way. He was simply playing by the rules.
{cps=50}After shaking Duncan's hand, you become the captain of the guard at the Marquis of Chippenham's castle. Ahead of you are marriage and children, an unexpected knighthood, and a weighty gold chain as thick as your finger. Tournaments and a scandalous affair with the Duke of Cambridge's youngest daughter. A controversial reputation and death at the hands of an assassin.
{cps=50}After shaking Duncan's hand, you become the captain of the guard at the Marquis of Chippenham's castle. And your first assignment is to quell a peasant uprising in several villages south of the castle.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 17 of 19.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Looking into Duncan's eyes, for a second you recall that you once saw him being different.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}In rags and knee-deep in mud, standing in a forest camp surrounded by hungry deserter soldiers and runaway peasants and telling them about the need to fight the tyranny of the nobility.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}But this image is so distant and ghostly that it dissipates after a moment. As if it never existed.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You plunge a dagger into his heart, and the glass falls out of his hand to the floor, shattering into pieces.
{cps=50}Exquisite Burgundy or Alsatian wine splashes, mixing with blood, and Chippenham — for the second time in a year — loses its marquis.
{cps=50}Perfectly navigating the castle you once stormed, defended, and lived in for months, you slip away from the guards without much difficulty. When Duncan's men discover his body, you're too far away to be caught.
{cps=50}After grabbing a jug of the cheapest liquor at a roadside inn, you head to the marquis' hunting grounds.
{cps=50}Where you and Jones buried Rodolfo's body, between two inconspicuous oaks.
{cps=50}You don't know what will happen next yet. But something tells you that the answer will definitely reveal itself.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 18 of 19.

{cps=50}A messenger finds and informs you that Duncan wants to talk to you.
{cps=50}In order to determine the future plan of the fight against the liege lords, Duncan gathers a council of his confidants, to which you are invited.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [for_a_good_cause.name!ti].
{cps=50}The trip to the Sheriff's residence is uneventful.
{cps=50}After showing the captain of the guard a bag full of florins, you immediately receive an audience with the Sheriff.
{cps=50}Despite having a whole bag of reasons for gratitude, the audience is not held in a very friendly atmosphere.
{cps=50}Roughly taking the bag from you, the Sheriff declares that as of today, the price of his favor is doubled. He also forbids Duncan and his men to undertake any major action without first obtaining his consent.
{cps=50}Which is particularly necessary for any attacks on lords' estates or people.
{cps=50}Upon returning, you relay the Sheriff's words to Duncan, but he shrugs it off, claiming that the Sheriff's help was valuable only as long as the squad was but a pathetic bunch of untrained peasants operating right under his nose.
{cps=50}Now that the squad is a much more powerful combat unit and plans to move to Chippenham, the services of the Greenwich sheriff are no longer relevant.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}50 florins received!
{cps=50}Taking you and a dozen other good fighters with him, Jones travels around the neighborhood of Greenwich, collecting an impromptu tax from the used-to-be Caldwells' holdings.
{cps=50}For the most part, everything goes smoothly — no money is taken from those who are already struggling to make ends meet. Those who are wealthier — millers, innkeepers, prosperous farmers, and merchants — are charged the amount they can afford and told as to what the money will be used for.
{cps=50}However, problems end up arising as well. In one of the villages you are met by a group of well-armed villagers. Their leader claims that the village is already paying them for protection — from repeated charges of any money as well.
{cps=50}After about half an hour of unsuccessful negotiations, Jones orders to reach for the weapons.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}The situation on the battlefield is shifting. The battle might be soon coming to an end.
{cps=50}The surviving peasants hastily retreat...
{cps=50}After dispersing the peasants and demonstratively collecting a manageable, yet still not the smallest sum from the village, you move on.
{cps=50}This time Jones is ready to backtrack, but the mercenaries are not about to simply let you go and attack first.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Upon arriving, you find Rodolfo and Jones in the middle of a heated conversation.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A crossbow bolt whistles from some bushes, hitting Rodolfo right between the eyes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The face smashed by the blow turns into an ugly mask, and the lifeless body falls flat to the ground.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Sighing, Jones turns his gaze to you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The prospect of getting a crossbow bolt between the eyes and lying down on the ground next to Rodolfo does not particularly appeal to you, so your answer is obvious.
{cps=50}On the evening of the same day Duncan calls a regular council. To your surprise, the meeting place this time is moved from the common hall, where such events were usually held, to the office of the marquis.
{cps=50}However, the reasons for surprise do not end there — there are literally just four people in the office from the 'old guard', that is, those who were in Duncan's squad during the confrontation with the Caldwells or the marquis: you, Jones, and two more sergeants.
{cps=50}The rest of those present are a dozen of mercenary captains, managers of all sorts, stewards, and accountants dealing with various administrative and economic matters.
{cps=50}After making you wait for a good quarter of an hour, Duncan finally shows up.
{cps=50}The commercial quarter of Damietta, which occupies several blocks in the old part of the city, is a maze of narrow and wide streets, crammed with all sorts of stores, as well as filled with carts and stalls, from which a motley crowd sells all kinds of conceivable and inconceivable goods.
{cps=50}You can almost certainly find a lot of interesting stuff here if you take your time and search properly...
{cps=50}You spend the day exploring the commercial quarter and examining the goods for sale.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[storyroll!ti]{vspace=5}Time lost: 1!
{cps=50}Located in a prominent place and beautifully furnished, the shop is filled with all kinds of armor - mostly lightweight versions.
{cps=50}Your attention is immediately attracted by the fact that all the inscriptions are not made in the local dialect, but in European languages, and the shopkeeper himself, upon seeing you, immediately speaks to you in a quite understandable language, albeit a little broken. It is obvious that the main customers here are people like you, who have arrived from overseas.
{cps=50}The situation becomes completely clear when you finally take a look at the prices and notice that they are all at least two-three times too high.
{cps=50}Looks like for some people war is grief, and yet for others, it's an opportunity to make a good living.
{cps=50}During these months, many of your comrades, tired of the enforced waiting and idleness, willingly transfer to the service of various local lords and seigneurs who are interested in the services of experienced soldiers and are ready to pay generously.
{cps=50}Unwilling to repeat the fate of comrades executed for violating the law, many soldiers sell off war booty and equipment just to be able to purchase food.
{cps=50}You have enough money to pay for your food for most of the waiting period and practically not starve, receiving minimal harm to your health.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}200 florins lost!{vspace=5}All characteristics are decreased by 1!
{cps=50}Mere pennies that you have are only enough for you to somehow maintain life in your body by consuming crusts of stale bread and water.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}50 florins lost!
{cps=50}Naturally, such a diet greatly undermines your health.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}All characteristics are decreased by 3!
{cps=50}Without a penny to your name, you have no choice but to starve, immediately spending any randomly acquired coin on a crust of stale bread.
{cps=50}By some miracle, you manage not to starve to death, but the damage done to your health is difficult to overestimate.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}All characteristics are decreased by 4!
{cps=50}But, along with the good news also comes an unpleasant notice — due to the lack of space on board, none of the ordinary soldiers and militia are allowed to take chests with war booty with them to the ship.
{cps=50}Among the last soldiers of the royal army, you leave Dunkirk on a ship that is heading back to England.
{cps=50}During the voyage, many of your comrades suffer from seasickness, but you tolerate your stay on the ship well.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Coordination check passed!

{cps=50}On the way the ship is becalmed, but after a few hours of waiting, the wind nevertheless rises again, and by the evening you manage to arrive safely in Dover.
{cps=50}The creaking ship deck and the salt-smelling holds remain behind, and Dunkirk, Cambrai, and the royal camp tents are gradually turning into an increasingly distant memory.
{cps=50}It's time to start a new page in your life.
{cps=50}Since you have no relatives or acquaintances in Dover, you, despite the fatigue, intend to immediately go to your native Maidstone, which is about a day's journey from the south coast.
{cps=50}However, one of the soldiers who returned with you from France and happened to be a local warns you against it. According to him, the surroundings of Dover have always had a bad reputation as a dangerous place for lone wayfarers — especially for those who risk traveling after sunset.
{cps=50}Instead of going who-knows-where in the dark, he suggests that you join other soldiers and stop at some town tavern to celebrate your safe return from the war, spend the night in safety, and have a good rest. And then set off at dawn.
{cps=50}There is certain logic in his proposal, but the place where he suggests staying for the night does not inspire much confidence, to put it mildly...
{cps=50}On reflection, you decide to listen to the advice and not travel at night.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}10 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}Except for the extremely sour beer, which suddenly turns out to be also really strong.
{cps=50}After a hearty dinner and a good drink, you get to your room on unsteady legs, fall on the bed, and sleep like the dead.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Fatigue level decreased to 0!
{cps=50}An attempt to address the tavern owner does not lead to anything, as he just shrugs you off, blaming everything on your own drunken adventures yesterday.
{cps=50}When irritation gets the better of you and you start threatening him, he immediately calls for help from the town guard, which kicks you out of the tavern first, and then out of the town.
{cps=50}You have no choice but to head to Maidstone with empty pockets. The only weak consolation is that you do it well rested and during daylight.
{cps=50}You get up early in the morning and immediately hit the road.
{cps=50}His arguments do not convince you, and you prefer to set out immediately.
{cps=50}The consequences of this decision do not take long to manifest: in about the third hour of the journey fatigue takes its toll, and you, right on horseback, fall first into a light nap, and then into a full sleep.
{cps=50}Sleep, out of which you are suddenly pulled by a heavy blow to the back of your head. Before you can figure anything out, a group of unknown people manages to pull you out of the saddle and then inflict a series of blows to your body and head.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Concussion!
{cps=50}After a few moments, you nonetheless come to your senses, pull out your weapon, and start desperately swinging it around, fighting off the attackers.
{cps=50}Soon, the attackers actually retreat, leaving you alone. After checking on yourself and making sure that there were no serious injuries and all the things were in place, you were already going to rejoice...
{cps=50}When you suddenly realize that the villains did not leave empty-handed — the purse from your belt was deftly cut off.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[player_gold] florins lost!
{cps=50}Fortunately, the adventures end there, and you overcome the rest of the road to Maidstone without any issues.
{cps=50}When the familiar spire of the town hall appears behind the nearest hill, it becomes warm in your chest.
{cps=50}Fortunately, you meet no robbers along the way, and the only problem you have to face is navigating an unfamiliar area.
{cps=50}After wandering around for a long while, you still manage to find the right road. And, when the familiar spire of the town hall appears behind the nearest hill, it becomes warm in your chest.

{cps=50}Having found a number of aggravating circumstances that came out of nowhere in your case, the court imposes the death sentence, which is to be carried out the next morning.
{cps=50}You are looking for a job, but there is nothing suitable so far...
{cps=50}The fight is dragging on. Perhaps you should retreat to save your life...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tutorial — Bouncer job.{vspace=5}The bouncer's task is to neutralize troublemakers using ONLY NON-LETHAL methods of influence. Unprovoked murders are a violation of the law and can lead to various punishments, including arrest and imprisonment or even execution.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The bouncer's weapon is a club. Bouncers are allowed to carry other weapons, but the use of any lethal weapon is prohibited by the owner of the establishment and may lead to dismissal.
{cps=50}There is clearly some history between these two groups and, judging by the mutual causticity and hostility, it is far from pleasant.
{cps=50}There are some people scurrying everywhere, contradictory orders shouted loudly from all sides, crowds of lost recruits wandering from one commander's tent to another, and the newly unloaded wagons being reloaded - and right after that is done, the luggage is taken off them again.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have been assigned the rank of Militiaman.
{cps=50}No amount of enemy efforts can make you flee, but your success pales against the backdrop of the events unfolding around you.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Command's favor increased by 2!
{cps=50}And those few units that are still fighting can no longer make a difference as the bulk of the army is fleeing.
{cps=50}Looking at all this, you are slowly filled with more and more skepticism about the future prospects of the parliamentary army in general and of your own, as its soldier, in particular.
{cps=50}Following this, a few doctors arrive at the camp. They are, of course, mainly concerned with the knights and their men, but for a handful of florins they do not refuse to examine peasants as well.
{cps=50}Desertion is stopped, and many of those who managed to flee are caught and demonstratively executed.
{cps=50}You, along with a group of other veteran soldiers who participated in the battle of London and also have the experience of past wars behind them, are assembled into one unit.
{cps=50}It is noteworthy that Windsor itself, despite its obviously strategic location, does not appear to be well defended. The town has very impressive, albeit dilapidated fortifications, but there are hardly any men on its fortress walls and towers.
{cps=50}You honestly carry out the task you have received and try to guard the ships vigilantly.
{cps=50}Fortunately, you are on your guard and stop the scoundrels.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility, Coordination, Luck check passed!
{cps=50}Roger, pleased that everything went smoothly, gives everyone a handful of florins for their good service.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}50 florins received!

{cps=50}The fact of the theft is discovered after returning to the camp. Not knowing who of those guarding the ships committed the crime, Roger decides to punish everyone.
{cps=50}Unwilling to expose your comrades to punishment, you tell Roger that the fault lies with you.
{cps=50}After giving you praise for at least having the courage to confess what you've done, Roger orders you to be brutally flogged and to have some of your equipment confiscated as compensation for damage.

{cps=50}With a respectful nod, you acknowledge that his offer is now definitely worth considering.... Unfortunately, however, you have other things planned for this time.
{cps=50}The plan works flawlessly and, after a quarter of an hour, you are already breaking into the town. The Windsor garrison, outnumbered and taken by surprise, can do nothing against the surprise attack and prefers to surrender.
{cps=50}Having gathered a solid force, the enemy finally decides to launch a full-fledged assault.
{cps=50}At the same time, the siege camp begins to receive companies of mercenaries, which look much more menacing and hardened than the militias and soldiers who were sent to storm the town for the first time.
{cps=50}The surviving enemies retreat...
{cps=50}The situation in the city, meanwhile, is also gradually deteriorating. Thanks to the large supplies of provisions, there is no danger of famine yet, but the rations are gradually cut down, and it is no longer possible to eat your fill.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Vitality and Endurance decreased by 2!
{cps=50}That same evening, the first caravan with provisions arrives in Windsor and, for the first time in over a month, you eat to your heart's content.
{cps=50}Thanks to the various connections and acquaintances you have made during your stay here, it is easy to find a place to live. And the numerous friends you have made, both among soldiers and townspeople, brighten up your life.

{cps=50}An unpleasant surprise in the form of two uninvited guests who somehow got inside the house and, without any secrecy, settled right at the dining table.
{cps=50}Once out of town, you take a short break on a hill — just in time to enjoy the sight of the flaming building of the Maidstone moneylender guild.
{cps=50}The old count, as well as his young sadistic daughter, are well known throughout the area for their cruelty both to the rebels, whom they eradicate without pity, and to their own peasants, whom they hold in a tight grip and force to pay through the nose.
{cps=50}The next morning you, with a group of about a dozen well-armed rebels, ambush a road at the edge of the forest...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The knight's light blue eyes stare unblinkingly into Rodolfo's face, who responds in kind - piercing the knight with a look full of disgust.
{cps=50}Back at the camp, Duncan's men throw an epic bash in an atmosphere of universal jubilation. Watching their genuine fun from the sidelines and still suffering from internal reflections, you can't think of anything better than getting drunk with everyone.
{cps=50}But before you can do so, someone's hand comes down on your shoulder again.
{cps=50}The saved-up money comes in handy and makes it possible to provide this growing army with both food and equipment.
{cps=50}Seeing what the florins collected in Greenwich went for, Rodolfo, who has been taking that decision very hard, finally begins to feel better.
{cps=50}The personal standard of the marquis flying on the spire is torn off and thrown down. The marquis himself, who was captured wounded, is first publicly tortured and then executed, to general rejoicing.
{cps=50}Grabbing your gear, you follow Jones, who, while gathering more men along the way, leads you to a vast near-castle settlement bordering the marquis' residence on several sides.
{cps=50}The Sheriff, who apparently did not expect to see that, does not hurry with the assault and sends negotiators to the castle several times, offering the defenders to pay off.
{cps=50}Under the pressure of the storming troops, the defenders of the castle leave one of the towers and the sheriff's men manage to break into the castle...
{cps=50}The details of the conversation that took place between the earl's representative and the new Marquis of Chippenham are not known to you. However, even before the messenger has time to leave the castle, Duncan summons you.
{cps=50}Its spray reaches you as well, leaving some terrible burns.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 2!

{cps=50}A few hours later, you find yourself on the outskirts of the capital and immediately witness a picture that makes an indelible impression.
{cps=50}On the approach to London you find nothing less than a huge military camp, the size of which is quite comparable — and maybe even superior — to the one that was once set up by the English outside Cambrai.
{cps=50}There was a small detachment available to the prince at Dartford. In the fields near London, Count Canterbury has got a full-fledged army at his disposal.
{cps=50}After arriving at the camp, Roger, who is clearly a big shot here, immediately gives out some instructions and, a couple of minutes later, you find yourself on the training ground — surrounded by a chanting crowd and with a huge, steel-clad giant in front of you.
{cps=50}To everyone's surprise — and Roger's extreme chagrin — you kill your opponent in battle.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige increased by 3!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 20!
{cps=50}To everyone's surprise — and Roger's extreme chagrin — you manage to hold out for the allotted time.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}After swearing and cursing a few times, the red-haired knight, however, quickly gets over his irritation and gives you credit: first figuratively, praising your quickness in the fight with Goliath, and then directly, handing you the promised 3,000 florins.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}3000 florins received!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}On Roger's order, two tall men are brought out from somewhere in the camp - very shabby, but obviously still able and willing to fight back.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Roger points his finger at you.
{cps=50}After staying in the camp for some more time, in the late afternoon you, along with Roger and his squad, go to London, where you stay in someone's richly furnished residence.
{cps=50}After getting your own sleeping place, you spend the rest of the day talking to other knights and squires, from whom you learn that you are in the capital residence of Count Canterbury, and you are also surprised to hear that the military camp on the outskirts of the city is nothing but a parliamentary army of 'loyalists to the kingdom' assembled by the count to destroy the 'rebels' - Prince Edward and Earl Northampton.
{cps=50}The opportunity to understand the situation in more detail is presented to you the very next morning when Canterbury personally summons you to his office.
{cps=50}You're no military commander, but you're a man familiar with war closely enough. And you estimate that the army assembled by the count would be more than enough to take not one Dartford, but five at once. In one day.
{cps=50}As if voicing your thoughts, one of the parliamentarians asks whether all this means that the army assembled under the auspices of the Parliament has an overwhelming advantage over the rebel forces and is ready to crush them at any moment?
{cps=50}The count's answer is unequivocal.
{cps=50}{i}No.
{cps=50}And then it's your turn.
{cps=50}Having introduced you as one of the knights of Prince Edward and Earl Northampton, who has recently switched sides, Canterbury informs the Parliament that you have full information about the current state of affairs in Dartford — the lair of the rebels — and will now report on what is happening there.
{cps=50}Obeying the count's earlier instructions, you describe the situation at Dartford in detail and list the forces on the prince's side... increased about tenfold.
{cps=50}Thus, instead of a hundred knights and squires huddled in a small hunting castle, the 'Dartford rebel den' is rapidly expanding into a camp comparable in size to that of London. One by one, all the lords of southern England send their troops to Prince Edward, on top of the majority of the old king's troops still arriving from France.
{cps=50}By the end of your story, the relaxed and confident atmosphere that prevailed in the Parliament is replaced with panic.
{cps=50}Panic, in which the words of Count Canterbury sound like thunder...
{cps=50}{i}I will hold the capital and defeat the rebels. I swear it on my honor and my family's name.
{cps=50}{i}But for that I am going to need money.
{cps=50}{i}Lots of money.
{cps=50}An hour later, you and the count leave the Parliament, having received from its members unconditional consent to the immediate introduction of a whole list of new taxes, imposts, and levies, aimed mainly at the affluent segments of the population and designed to replenish the empty treasury...
{cps=50}...from which, in turn, direct allocations for the recruitment and maintenance of additional detachments as well as the defense of the capital will start as early as next week.
{cps=50}Count Canterbury will naturally be responsible for the expenditure of this money, and an auditor from the Parliament will be attached to him to supervise its targeted use.
{cps=50}Count Canterbury has ordered you to come at Roger's disposal and assist him in his tasks.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [counts_order.name!ti].
{cps=50}A messenger has arrived to inform you that Count Canterbury summons you on some urgent matter.
{cps=50}As you arrive at the count's place, you find him talking to the parliamentary auditor, who is shaking piles of papers and proving something to him in a heated manner.
{cps=50}Ruffin, who is also present, is cleaning a weapon a little to the side.
{cps=50}Your appearance completely turns the count's attention from the auditor to you. But before he can tell you anything, the doors behind your back open again, and several men, armed with swords and crossbows, barge in.
{cps=50}You and Ruffin end up being the only obstacle standing between them and the count...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}With a brief nod of his head, Canterbury points Ruffin to the auditor, who is still hiding behind an overturned table and whispering prayers from there.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ruffin responds with the same nod.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Taking a crossbow out of the hands of one of the assassins and pressing it against the floor, Ruffin draws the bowstring with his hands, without a mechanism.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ruffin carefully places a bolt on the stock of the crossbow.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The moment the auditor's head peeks out from behind the desk, the crossbow bowstring sends a weighty bolt with a whistle straight into his eye.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The force of the blow is such that the auditor's puny body is not just knocked down, but dragged across the floor, leaving a bloody trail.
{cps=50}When you end up amidst the army assembled by the count and the Parliament and occupy the assigned positions in the fields under London, you make the unpleasant discovery that this very army consists of three quarters of recruits. They are a bunch of yesterday's peasants, day laborers, drunkards, and convicts pulled from all over the kingdom, who have a very vague idea of what war is.
{cps=50}The quantity of troops defending London was impressive. Yet their quality left much to be desired.
{cps=50}Another interesting observation for you was that the reinforcements promised by the Duke of Cambridge were nowhere to be seen. Whether they deliberately did not appear on the field of the upcoming battle or simply got stuck somewhere along the way was unknown, but now there was clearly no reason to count on them.
{cps=50}The vanguard you lead somehow manages to take the assigned positions in time. The veteran detachment, led by Roger, is also in its place, a little further away from the main forces. But your immediate neighbors are doing worse than ever.
{cps=50}Every now and then, the recruits are huddled together in unruly masses, struggling to move in formation and taking wrong turns. As a result, by the time Prince Edward's troops appear in front of you, there are still gaping holes in both of your flanks.
{cps=50}In a hurry to take advantage of this oversight, the enemy immediately throws several detachments at your vanguard, trying to surround you...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Your squad fights steadfastly, and the encirclement is only partially successful. Meanwhile, reinforcements approach you from the left and right and gradually begin to push back the enemy.
{cps=50}The battle slows down, smoothly turning into a grueling confrontation between two walls of shields in a war of attrition.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Unable to hold you back, the enemy begins to retreat, destroying their own formation.
{cps=50}Already feeling the taste of victory, you go in pursuit, also letting your formation fall apart. And that turns out to be a mistake.
{cps=50}Behind the retreating enemy soldiers appears another formation — this time of knights in armor decorated with gold and silver.
{cps=50}And the full force of their strike falls on you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}You are defending stubbornly, yet the scales are slowly but surely tipping in favor of the enemy. The militia recruits that make up the bulk of the parliamentary army are no match for the experienced and heavily armed knights, even though they are outnumbered.
{cps=50}As soon as the most motivated and courageous of the militia are killed or injured, your allies begin to retreat.
{cps=50}Realizing that the decisive moment of the battle is at hand, Prince Edward and his retinue personally join their knights, initiating a final attack designed to split the crumbling parliamentary army in two.
{cps=50}And he is successful. The appearance of the prince's personal standard on the battlefield breathes new strength into the remnants of his men. And the militia's morale, which is barely alive, seems to be broken completely.
{cps=50}The retreat begins turning into a rout.
{cps=50}But at this moment, when it seems that victory has finally slipped out of the hands of the army assembled by the count, the situation changes radically once again — for the last time during this battle.
{cps=50}Roger's squad hits the flank of the knights pressing on you. At first, the situation does not look hopeless for the enemy: the shocked knights rally around the prince and continue to fight hard, and it seems that if they receive reinforcements, the course of the battle can change once more.
{cps=50}But there are no more reserves around to go to their rescue.
{cps=50}Encouraged by Roger's attack, the few still disciplined units of the parliamentary army, one by one, return to the battlefield...
{cps=50}And the situation for Prince Edward turns from dire to utterly hopeless.
{cps=50}Watching from the sidelines, you see as the ring of encirclement closes around his standard. As his bodyguards fall to the ground one by one. And as the fluttering over the battlefield personal banner of the king's son finally disappears.
{cps=50}The battle ends.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You find Count Canterbury on a hill overlooking the field, where he, at an improvised command post, listens to Roger's report.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}From behind a neighboring hill, spears and banners bearing the coats of arms of the Duke of Cambridge's many vassals begin to appear.
{cps=50}The defeat of Prince Edward's army at the Battle of London marks the long-awaited end of hostilities. But where a war fought with fire and steel ends, a new war immediately begins, now fought with quills and ink.
{cps=50}With the death of the prince, the extinction of the royal dynasty meant that there was no 'rightful heir' to the throne, which in turn allowed anyone who could back his claims up with something to announce his right to the throne.
{cps=50}Naturally, a whole list of candidates appeared — each with a lineage going back centuries, in one way or another connected with the late king and prince.
{cps=50}Parliament, not long ago ready to kiss the feet of Count Canterbury, instantly cooled towards his person with the end of the war.
{cps=50}Too authoritative, too rich, and solely in command of a vast army under the walls of the capital, Canterbury, once on the throne, would overnight become a monarch to be reckoned with. A monarch who would be able to impose his will on the Parliament and the barons, rather than be an obedient puppet in their hands, as some landless, impoverished, and out-of-nowhere second cousin of the late king could easily be.
{cps=50}The parliament's sympathies were obvious.
{cps=50}The Duke of Cambridge's position was much more interesting. Bound to Canterbury by their alliance, he, in words, remained faithful to their treaty. In practice, however, instead of supporting the count in his dispute with the Parliament, he unexpectedly supported the parliamentarians' demand for the dissolution of the army assembled by Canterbury.
{cps=50}According to him, it is the dissolution of this huge army, hanging over the capital like a sword of Damocles, that will really mark the actual end of the war.
{cps=50}And only then will it be possible to finally resolve the issue of a new king, without fear that someone will come up with the idea of usurping the throne again.
{cps=50}For some reason, the duke was in no hurry to disband the banners gathered from all his considerable lands.
{cps=50}An already tenuous alliance has crumbled before your eyes...
{cps=50}A messenger finds and informs you that the count wants to speak to you.
{cps=50}After leaving London, you head north: first to Bedford, from there to Coventry and Leicester, then to Nottingham and finally to Sheffield, located very close to the two border cities - York and Leeds.
{cps=50}Rushing as hard as you can, you become exhausted and drive one horse after another.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased.
{cps=50}Sleepless nights and disgusting weather also take their toll on you...{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Toxicity level increased.
{cps=50}However, you continue on your way no matter what.
{cps=50}Having not yet encountered a single rumor or mention of a Scottish invasion, you gradually get used to the idea that the border is safe.
{cps=50}And all the greater is your surprise when, on the road to Leeds, just a few hours' ride from Sheffield, you literally come face to face with a small Scottish detachment...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Having put the Scots to flight, you hastily climb a nearby hill from which you could survey the surroundings and gaze into the distance.
{cps=50}On the horizon, in columns of black smoke, you can see York, on the road from which to Leeds, which is located closer to you, stretches an endless string of fleeing refugees moving on foot and on horseback, light and with bales or carts.
{cps=50}The question of border security has become rhetorical.
{cps=50}Upon your return, Canterbury immediately convenes a war council...
{cps=50}By the evening of the following day, every resident of the city knew the news of the Scottish invasion. The Parliament, which had urgently gathered for a meeting, was supposed to discuss the defense plan of the kingdom. Speaking at the meeting, Count Canterbury accused the Duke of Cambridge of conspiring with the Scots, of treason, and of hatching plans to usurp power.
{cps=50}Naturally, he had no actual evidence. But it was not needed, because, immediately after the end of the count's speech, there was a huge fire in the building, killing most of the parliamentarians.
{cps=50}Street gossipers and tavern patrons, putting two and two together, immediately generate rumors and talk that the Parliament was burned by the duke's men — in response to the truth revealed by the count about his secret dealings with the Scots.
{cps=50}Count Canterbury himself — a loyal servant of the late king, a participant in his campaigns, the savior of the capital from destruction during the war, and now also a man who uncovered a dangerous plot and miraculously escaped from the fire — instantly becomes a favorite of the common people.
{cps=50}The facts that you and Roger set the fire in Parliament and that the florins in the pockets of the gossipers came directly from the storerooms of the count's estate in London, are of course not told to the common people. For the less you know, the better you sleep.
{cps=50}The Duke of Cambridge himself, hiding in his estate under the protection of the assembled troops, had no choice but to silently observe what was happening and pray to the heavens that the Scots would reach the capital as soon as possible.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [the_price_of_failure.name!ti].
{cps=50}Canterbury wasted no time and a few days after the fire, his troops, led by you and Roger, were already standing under the walls of Cambridge Castle...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}After capturing the fortress walls, you break into the castle...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Having dealt with the last defenders of Cambridge, you break into the duke's own chambers.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Roger shuts him up with a blow to the face, from which the duke falls down like a sack, and his teeth scatter like peas on the stone floor.
{cps=50}The execution of the Duke of Cambridge, which took place in the central square of London, seems to become the last missing piece of the mosaic, with the appearance of which everything finally falls into place.
{cps=50}To the cheers of the crowd, Count Canterbury first beheads the duke with the Sword of Justice and then vows to defend the kingdom against all enemies, both internal and external. The end of his fiery speech is met by the crowd chanting, 'King! King!'.
{cps=50}At dusk of the same day comes the news that the Scots have passed Cambridge and halted one day's march from London. The time has come for the oath made to the people to be affirmed in deed.
{cps=50}The following afternoon, the two armies meet on the plain north of the capital, starting the second battle of London this year.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}The first few hours of the battle end in a draw and the sides bring reserves into the battle.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Despite the huge losses on both sides, no one has managed to gain an advantage.
{cps=50}Seeing that their troops are exhausted, the commanders of the two armies decide to negotiate.
{cps=50}James stays true to his word, and the next day the Scottish troops retreat from London, setting off on a long journey back. Another crisis remains behind.
{cps=50}Count Canterbury's popular approval, already high, finally soars to the skies. The kingdom, devastated, bloodied, and extremely fatigued by war and turmoil, readily accepts its new monarch.
{cps=50}Not forgetting the promise once given to you, Canterbury not only generously rewards you, but also makes you a count with a solid land allotment.
{cps=50}You also get a small place in 'The Legend of King Alfred', a heroic epic composed by court troubadours based on the events of the war between the lords and the subsequent Scottish invasion.
{cps=50}Thus, having once started your path as a simple militia, in a short period of time you become one of the first people in the kingdom, gaining fame and wealth unimaginable for a yesterday's commoner. And also perpetuating own name in the annals of the kingdom's history.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 19 of 19.
{cps=50}You are defending stubbornly, yet the scales are slowly but surely tipping in favor of the enemy. The militia recruits that make up the bulk of the parliamentary army are no match for the experienced and heavily armed knights, even though they are outnumbered.
{cps=50}As soon as the most motivated and courageous of the militia are killed or injured, your allies begin to retreat.
{cps=50}Realizing that the decisive moment of the battle is at hand, Prince Edward and his retinue personally join their knights, initiating a final attack designed to split the crumbling parliamentary army in two.
{cps=50}And he is successful. The appearance of the prince's personal standard on the battlefield breathes new strength into the remnants of his men. And the militia's morale, which is barely alive, seems to be broken completely.
{cps=50}The retreat begins turning into a rout.
{cps=50}But at this moment, when it seems that victory has finally slipped out of the hands of the army assembled by the count, the situation changes radically once again — for the last time during this battle.
{cps=50}Roger's squad hits the flank of the knights pressing on you. At first, the situation does not look hopeless for the enemy: the shocked knights rally around the prince and continue to fight hard, and it seems that if they receive reinforcements, the course of the battle can change once more.
{cps=50}But there are no more reserves around to go to their rescue.
{cps=50}Encouraged by Roger's attack, the few still disciplined units of the parliamentary army, one by one, return to the battlefield...
{cps=50}And the situation for Prince Edward turns from dire to utterly hopeless.
{cps=50}Watching from the sidelines, you see as the ring of encirclement closes around his standard. As his bodyguards fall to the ground one by one. And as the fluttering over the battlefield personal banner of the king's son finally disappears.
{cps=50}The battle ends.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You find Count Canterbury on a hill overlooking the field, where he, at an improvised command post, listens to Roger's report.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}From behind a neighboring hill, spears and banners bearing the coats of arms of the Duke of Cambridge's many vassals begin to appear.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You already possess all the civic skills Rodolfo can teach you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You are too tired and not ready to learn!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}There's not enough time to learn!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Weapon talents: +1!{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!{vspace=5}Time lost: 1.
{cps=50}A messenger finds and informs you that Roger demands you to report to him immediately.
{cps=50}Not wanting to anger Roger, you keep your mouth shut the entire way to Bristol.
{cps=50}In the city, on Roger's orders, soldiers cordon off one of the piers, kicking all the onlookers out of there and, after another couple of hours, several ships arrive there.
{cps=50}While the port workers, under the supervision of knights and sergeants, unload boxes, barrels, and bales with all sorts of military equipment, you lazily watch tanned sailors, scurrying along the decks, and cunning-looking merchants, carefully counting the contents of the bags of gold received from Roger.
{cps=50}And then you notice the one person you least expected to see here.
{cps=50}Like a bolt out of the blue, Ruffin appears on deck.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ruffin places his hand on the hilt of his sword, and Roger slightly raises his hammer, adjusting his grip.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After standing like that for a few seconds, both of them slowly lower their weapons without a word.
{cps=50}The journey back is uneventful, and by the evening of the same day, your squad with Ruffin and a dozen carts loaded to the top with military equipment returns to London.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Having successfully completed the task, you receive praise from Roger.
{cps=50}A messenger finds and informs you that Roger demands you to report to him immediately.
{cps=50}After reprimanding you for being slow, Roger informs you that you are going to Cambridge immediately.
{cps=50}Most of the drive to Cambridge is uneventful. However, as you approach the duke's estate, you notice a large cloud of dust moving towards you from the east.
{cps=50}About half a league later, the cloud approaches even closer and turns out to be a group of armed horsemen heading, apparently, the same way as you.
{cps=50}Seeing that the paths of your squads are crossing, Roger and the commander of the unknown group of horsemen both order their men to halt and slowly converge on each other.
{cps=50}When this happens and you get a better look at the unknown riders, you are surprised to recognize several of them as members of Prince Edward and Northampton's retinue, people you crossed paths with at Dartford or even near Cambrai.
{cps=50}And the squad leader turns out to be a good acquaintance of yours.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The sergeant raises his voice slightly, addressing Maurice.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Roger's men respond with good-natured laughter.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The sergeant nods approvingly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Roger sighs with visible irritation and, with a face even more displeased than usual, continues.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}While members of both squads are battling wall-to-wall, Roger and the sergeant are fighting each other one-on-one.
{cps=50}Watching them with the corner of your eye, you see that the fight starts out fairly even, and it seems that either one of them could win.
{cps=50}Fighting with incredible fury, the sergeant puts as much force into each blow as if he wanted to topple a century-old oak tree.
{cps=50}Unable to dodge his blows in time, Roger, over and over again, simply defends himself against them with the steel sleeve of his armor — and the seemingly insurmountable force with which the sergeant unleashes his attacks on him simply crashes over him like a wave against a rock.
{cps=50}With each passing minute, the sergeant's actions gradually slow down: attacks lose might and sharpness drop by drop, measured breathing becomes heavy, defensive actions — instead of precise and clear — become clumsy and protracted.
{cps=50}And when these changes become completely obvious, Roger finally seizes the initiative and puts an end to the duel with one series of blows.
{cps=50}The sergeant's breathless body sinks to the grass almost simultaneously with the demise of the last members of his squad.
{cps=50}The battle ends.
{cps=50}The gates of the ducal estate swing open before you can even knock. Roger needs no introduction and the steward who greets you on the doorstep immediately escorts you to Henry Stafford, Duke of Cambridge.
{cps=50}The duke is letting you know that the conversation is over.
{cps=50}Before leaving Cambridge, Roger also drops off a pouch of florins to the local undertaker, having first taken an oath that he and his men will arrange a decent funeral for the sergeant and his squad.
{cps=50}The return trip passes in general silence.
{cps=50}However, the reasons for surprise do not end there — there are literally just four people in the office from the 'old guard', that is, those who were in Duncan's squad during the confrontation with the Caldwells or the marquis: you, Jones, and two more sergeants.
{cps=50}The rest of those present are a dozen of mercenary captains, managers of all sorts, stewards, and accountants dealing with various administrative and economic matters.
{cps=50}Visiting this kind of upper city establishment requires you to be properly dressed.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige - fail (required: 50)!
{cps=50}Having easily found the shop, you introduce yourself to its owner. However, before you have time to ask him anything, he tells you right away that he is overloaded with orders for months in advance and does not intend to take new ones for quite some time.
{cps=50}After hearing about who exactly recommended him to you, the owner takes a closer look at you...
{cps=50}Everything was purchased, ordered and paid for many months in advance.
{cps=50}So, to make any of your orders, you will need to not only pay well, but also provide the blacksmith with all the necessary materials.
{cps=50}The price for the work will be [london_blacksmith_flail_cost!i] florins.
{cps=50}Blacksmith accepted your order!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}Behind the retreating enemy soldiers appears another formation — this time of knights in armor decorated with gold and silver.
{cps=50}You cannot find Ruffin, no matter how much you search for him.
{cps=50}After asking other inhabitants of the count's estate, you learn that he left in an unknown direction almost immediately after the victory over the army of Prince Edward.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You find Ruffin in the process of getting ready to leave.
{cps=50}Your strike makes Ruffin fall down to the ground.
{cps=50}The mercenary immediately tries to get up, but the wounded body lets him down and all he can do is just raise himself a little... But then he falls again.
{cps=50}Numerous streams of blood flowing from his wounds in different directions form small rivers and lakes, leaving no doubt that he will never rise again.
{cps=50}Realizing that it's all over, Ruffin exhales.{vspace=5}{w}Exhales like a tired person exhales, who has been carrying an unbearably heavy burden on his shoulders for a long time and now, finally, got rid of it.
{cps=50}And closes his eyes.
{cps=50}After dispersing the peasants and demonstratively collecting a manageable, yet still not the smallest sum from the village, you move on.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 15!
{cps=50}After all, no matter what Duncan says, it is you and him who are at the forefront of any battle, and therefore it is you who know best how to manage this money...
{cps=50}One day, you strike up a conversation with a group of neighboring peasants who periodically deliver supplies to your camp.
{cps=50}Thanking you and Duncan for the fight you are waging, they share with you information about a fair that regularly takes place at Lindisfarne Abbey nearby and where you can buy many useful things.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue - success!
{cps=50}And you are surprised to discover that the loud noise and screams that were heard at the entrance to the abbey turned out to be not the sounds of a local fair, but the sounds of a brutal battle between two groups of well-armed knights and men-at-arms.
{cps=50}Hidden, you wait until the battle is over, and, after less than a quarter of an hour, the battle actually ends. One of the sides is partially killed and partially put to flight.
{cps=50}The victors, extremely exhausted from the battle and having suffered losses, immediately saddle their horses, intending to leave the abbey...
{cps=50}Duncan's camp is visited by grateful peasants who share with you all kinds of supplies.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue - success!
{cps=50}The surrounding villagers, angry at the behavior of Duncan's men, send a batch of poisoned food to your camp.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue - fail!{vspace=5}Toxicity increased!{vspace=5}Vitality lowered by 2!
{cps=50}Some of the local villagers, dissatisfied with the actions of Duncan and his men, reveal your camp's location to one of the local lords.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue - fail!
{cps=50}Seizing an opportunity, the lord’s men subject your camp to a surprise attack.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recover [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}You manage to repel the attack.
{cps=50}The inhabitants of Chippenham and its surroundings, angry that Duncan has resumed collecting all kinds of taxes and tolls, poison one of the wells in Chippenham Castle, leading to an outbreak of a contagious disease.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue - fail!{vspace=5}Toxicity increased!{vspace=5}Vitality lowered by 4!
{cps=50}Duncan is actively issuing orders to prepare for the defense of the castle. These include, among other things, the imposition of an additional levy 'for the defense of the lands of free Chippenham' and a decree to forcibly recruit one hundred and fifty local peasants and appoint them to fortification work.
{cps=50}Listening to all this, you wonder if it wouldn't be easier to just hide in some nearby forests, but you don't dare to say it out loud.
{cps=50}For no one here seems ready to leave the down featherbeds of castle bedrooms for dugouts in the woods.
{cps=50}Least of all Duncan.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [debt.name!ti]!
{cps=50}There are no new orders so far...
{cps=50}Having found out that you've set up an alchemical lab in your house and are now taking orders, the town officials demand that you pay a toll for running a business within the town limits. The toll is 50 florins.
{cps=50}Having found out that you've set up a craftsman's workshop in your house and are now taking orders, the town officials demand that you pay a toll for running a business within the town limits. The toll is 50 florins.
{cps=50}Having found out that you've set up a blacksmith's workshop in your house and are now taking orders, the town officials demand that you pay a toll for running a business within the town limits. The toll is 50 florins.
{cps=50}Having found out that you regularly peddle various goods without a license to conduct trading activities within the town, the Maidstone authorities require you to immediately purchase such a license, as well as pay a fine.
{cps=50}In total, both payments amount to 211 florins.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}45 florins lost.{vspace=5}Time lost: 1.{vspace=5}Fatigue level decreased!
{cps=50}Nothing noteworthy happens in the tavern while you spend your time eating and drinking.
{cps=50}While drinking in the tavern, you accidentally find yourself in the company of several suspicious individuals who, judging by their conversations, are smugglers.
{cps=50}Your new acquaintances' range of activities turns out to be very extensive: they are engaged not only in alcohol smuggling, but also in poaching in the surrounding forests, and sometimes they even steal alchemical ingredients that the Maidstone pharmacist grows on his land plots.
{cps=50}All this they are ready to give away at a good price.
{cps=50}While drinking in the tavern, you accidentally find yourself in the company of several ex-soldiers who have also recently returned from the war and are now thinking about opening their own inn.
{cps=50}They already have a well-thought-out plan of action, as well as connections with all the right people, and now it's just a matter of raising startup capital.
{cps=50}Despite having some savings, they are still short of money, so they are now looking for someone who would be willing to buy their military equipment leftover from the French campaign for good money in order to raise the required amount.
{cps=50}Upon hearing that you are interested, they suggest you visit them and get acquainted with the assortment.
{cps=50}However, they also warn you not to delay for too long, as there are other willing buyers.
{cps=50}While drinking in a tavern, you happen to catch a snippet of conversation between two friends discussing the collapse of a bridge over a river northwest of town.
{cps=50}According to them, the dilapidated bridge had long been in need of repair, but the lord, on whose land it was located, refused to spend money on it.
{cps=50}The explanation for this behavior is that, in the opinion of the lord, the main cause of the bridge deterioration was the numerous merchants making their way to Maidstone or, conversely, traveling north from it.
{cps=50}The town has a considerable profit from each of them in the form of taxes and tariffs paid, while the lord receives nothing from them except for an absolutely symbolic toll for traveling through his lands, which he has to spend on feeding himself... his family and numerous relatives, as well as on maintaining a band of knights, a troupe of traveling actors, and a whole stable of thoroughbred horses brought from Italy.
{cps=50}And therefore, again, according to the logic of the lord, it would be reasonable for Maidstone to pay for the repair of the bridge, which is crumbling under the weight of wagons loaded with goods, each of which brings a new handful of gold to the already solid town treasury.
{cps=50}The town, obviously, was not going to pay for anything, and so the dispute had been dragging on for years.
{cps=50}As a result, just a couple of days ago, when the lord was on his way to Maidstone to meet with the mayor in person, the bridge finally failed to stand the weight... and collapsed just as the lord and his entourage were passing over it.
{cps=50}There were no survivors.
{cps=50}And now the entire neighborhood is actively trying to fish out all sorts of things from the equipment of the lord and his men from the river bed. The problem is that in that particular spot the river is particularly deep and it is not an easy task to dive to the bottom, so most of the valuables have not been taken by anyone yet.
{cps=50}At this point the conversation is cut off, as the speakers finish their ale, leave the establishment, and continue chatting outside. However, you have already heard everything you needed to hear.
{cps=50}Suddenly, a squad of town guards bursts into the smugglers' hideout and immediately begins arresting everyone present.
{cps=50}As punishment for doing business with smugglers, you are obliged to pay a fine of 250 florins.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}250 florins lost!
{cps=50}After arriving at the ruins of the bridge and looking around, you quickly become convinced that the river here is indeed very deep and diving to the bottom would be an extremely risky endeavor.
{cps=50}If you can't reach the stuff on your own, then why not just hide in the nearest bushes and wait for someone else to do it for you...
{cps=50}And then just leave your hiding place and make the poor guy an offer he can't refuse.
{cps=50}However, your modest stamina is only enough to dive to a very small depth.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance check failed!{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased.
{cps=50}After making sure you can't get to the bottom under any circumstances, you head back.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: 1.
{cps=50}Thanks to your impressive stamina, you hold your breath long enough to reach the bottom...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance check passed!{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased.
{cps=50}But the pitch darkness at such a depth and the silt covering the bottom make locating anything extremely difficult.
{cps=50}If you really hope to return to the surface with some kind of catch, then you will literally have to search everything around with your hands.
{cps=50}In the meantime, there's hardly any air left...
{cps=50}The lack of air, meanwhile, is becoming more apparent...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}Having exhausted your body's capabilities, you decide to resurface.
{cps=50}You manage to find something!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Coordination, Luck check passed!
{cps=50}You're trying to find something, but nothing comes up.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Coordination, Luck check failed!
{cps=50}After safely getting back to the shore and drying off a little, you head back to the town.
{cps=50}However, as soon as you take literally two steps away from the wreckage of the bridge, several armed men of extremely unfriendly appearance jump out of the nearest bushes.
{cps=50}Surrounding you on all sides, they demand that you hand over everything found at the river bottom and promise not to harm you if you fulfill their demands.
{cps=50}Once they get what they want, they leave you alone.
{cps=50}You have to go home empty-handed.
{cps=50}You're not going to submit to the brigands' demands, and so you draw your weapon...
{cps=50}Unwilling to risk your health and life for the sake of highly dubious prospects, you decide to abandon the search.
{cps=50}After safely getting back to the shore, you head back to the town.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: 2!
{cps=50}This idea is to your liking and, comfortably positioned in the nearby bushes, you wait for your victim.
{cps=50}You spend several hours in ambush, and in the afternoon luck finally smiles on you. Some peasant with a sack appears near the wreckage of the bridge and dives into the depths several times, each time coming back out with armfuls of some stuff.
{cps=50}After waiting for him to fill his sack and get ready for the return trip, you leave your hiding place and, threatening the poor man with a weapon, demand to hand over the sack.
{cps=50}Scared half to death, the peasant gives you the sack without question and rushes away.
{cps=50}Back home, you finally get the opportunity to take a closer look at the things found at the bottom of the river.
{cps=50}You spend all day in ambush, but no one ever shows up.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: 4!{vspace=5}Fatigue level decreased!{vspace=5}Luck check failed!
{cps=50}As the sun begins to slowly disappear over the horizon, you, hungry and tired, decide to return home.
{cps=50}After thinking the situation over once more, you decide that there is nothing for you here and go back.
{cps=50}One afternoon, you by chance find yourself in the upper town and notice portraits of wanted criminals on a wall of the town hall. You are surprised to notice that one of them looks suspiciously like you.
{cps=50}And he is wanted for... A robbery committed at the ruins of an old bridge northwest of Maidstone.
{cps=50}At the same moment, by coincidence, a group of guards ends up nearby, who also notice some similarities between the man in the portrait and you.
{cps=50}However, your extremely respectable appearance protects you from any suspicion, and the guards only advise you to change your image a little - for example, grow a beard or cut your hair shorter to avoid unpleasant resemblances.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige check passed!
{cps=50}At the same moment, by coincidence, a group of guards ends up nearby, who also notice a striking similarity between you and the man in the portrait and arrest you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige check failed!
{cps=50}You spend the next day under arrest, after which you find yourself introduced to the very peasant who was ambushed and robbed near the wreckage of the bridge.
{cps=50}He naturally recognizes you, and town officials formally charge you with robbery.
{cps=50}In order to avoid jail, you must pay the victim an amount equivalent to the total value of the items taken from him ([maidstone_bridge_items_total_cost!i] florins), and, on top of that, compensate for moral harm caused to him (200 florins).
{cps=50}The town authorities, for their part, also require you to pay a fine of 300 florins for the committed crime.
{cps=50}In total, to avoid jail, you must pay [storyroll!i] florins.
{cps=50}Since you don't have enough money, the town authorities decide to confiscate a part of your property as restitution.
{cps=50}Since you don't have enough money, the town authorities decide to confiscate a part of your property as restitution.

{cps=50}Intimidated by your ferocity, bandits seemingly start having second thoughts about their decision to mess with you.
{cps=50}Back home, you finally get the opportunity to take a closer look at the things found at the bottom of the river.
{cps=50}Just a couple days after arriving in Maidstone, as soon as you've settled into your new home, a squad of town guards, led by one of the captains, shows up on your doorstep.
{cps=50}According to his words, due to the unsettled situation in this part of the kingdom, Maidstone authorities are now keeping a close eye on everyone arriving in the town in order to identify in advance any potentially 'problematic' or 'undesirable' residents who might disturb the peace.
{cps=50}You too were investigated in the same manner and found to be an untrustworthy person with a shady background, prone to breaking the law.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue - fail!
{cps=50}Thus, the town officials have decided to place you on a list of potential criminals and also preventively confiscate some of your weapons and military gear in order to make sure that you would not be able to pose a serious threat to anyone. Especially the town guard.
{cps=50}In response to your protests and accusations of unlawful actions, the captain of the guard reminds you that a lowly peasant like you should be more polite with the authorities... Otherwise, he will gladly show you what the real unlawful actions look like - and then you will lose not only your weapons and armor, but also your home, all of your belongings, and maybe even your head.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Roger hands you a piece of parchment with an address on it.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You spend the next hour practicing all sorts of attack and defense techniques under Roger's supervision.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}By the end of the hour, the sweat is pouring off you like a waterfall, and your arms and legs can barely move from fatigue. But this grueling workout, by all accounts, was not in vain.

{cps=50}You go to the place where scouts have reported sightings of the Scottish advance detachments...
{cps=50}Having difficulty navigating a wooded and unfamiliar terrain, you face an unpleasant choice: move cautiously but slowly - at the risk of letting the Scots slip away. Or move in a hurry, maintaining high speed but risking being ambushed...

After shaking Duncan's hand, you become the captain of the guard at the Marquis of Chippenham's castle. Ahead of you are marriage and children, an unexpected knighthood, and a weighty gold chain as thick as your finger. Tournaments and a scandalous affair with the Duke of Cambridge's daughter. A controversial reputation and death at the hands of an assassin.
{cps=50}One day, you are suddenly summoned by the sergeant. He informs you that you will be transferred from the main camp to a distant outpost for the next few days to replace one of the soldiers who has contracted dysentery.
{cps=50}You are to set out tomorrow morning, so the sergeant has given you the rest of the day to prepare. He recommends that you rest and stock up on basic necessities because the outpost is quite far from the main camp and the supply situation there is rough.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [money_has_no_smell.name!ti].
{cps=50}You forget about the recent assignment and fail to show up at the appointed time, to the sergeant's extreme irritation.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (the earl) decreased by 3!
{cps=50}However, this does not help you avoid the necessity of going to the remote outpost. After listening to many new words from the sergeant and getting heftily smacked, you hastily join several other soldiers already waiting for you on a supply wagon ready to go.
{cps=50}At the appointed hour you join several other soldiers and set out to the distant outpost on a wagon filled to the top with provisions and other belongings.
{cps=50}After a quarter of an hour's ride, you arrive at the destination...
{cps=50}The outpost in question covers the western part of the city, preventing the besieged from contacting with the outside world through a small side gate.
{cps=50}It is occupied by just a dozen people and is run by a deputy commander - a suspicious-looking fellow with a cunning squint and a habit of always looking around warily.
{cps=50}You strike up a conversation with one of them, in which you frankly declare that this remote outpost could go to hell, along with the necessity to stay here for several days - in even more disgusting conditions than in the main English camp.
{cps=50}Instead of giving you words of solidarity and support, however, your interlocutor responds with laughter, pats you on the shoulder, and offers a bet: 50 florins that when your stay here comes to an end, you will beg to stay for at least another day or two.
{cps=50}Seeing your confusion, he makes sure that the other new arrivals from the main camp do not hear you and brings you up to speed.
{cps=50}According to him, some time ago, their commander has made contact with someone from Cambrai and let them know that, for a moderate fee, he might well pretend to be blind and deaf on occasion, allowing the besieged to smuggle small wagons in and out of the city.
{cps=50}The city residents were very interested in this proposal, and when they were convinced that the deputy keeps his word, things at the outpost went much, much better.
{cps=50}Almost every night, small wagons with provisions, medicines, and equipment are delivered to the besieged. The wounded are regularly transported out of Cambrai, as well as the most affluent citizens, who no longer wish to remain under siege and are willing to pay for the opportunity to leave the city.
{cps=50}And the inhabitants of the outpost, with the resourceful deputy at the head, wind up with a big score from all this. Of course, no one has yet filled their chests with gold, but everyone is doing very well.
{cps=50}As they say, what you guard is what you get.
{cps=50}The deputy has forbidden to let other new arrivals in on this scheme, but it was decided to make an exception for you as a well-respected person.
{cps=50}So if you're willing to keep your mouth shut, a handful or two of florins will soon fall into your pocket as well.
{cps=50}That same night, while standing guard, you witness a caravan of half a dozen wagons arrive in the city under cover of darkness, along with a small reinforcement of a dozen men.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}The city's defenses have been reinforced!
{cps=50}A relatively similar scenario is repeated several more times during your stay at the outpost.
{cps=50}Sleepless nights and modest (at times downright meager) nutrition exhaust you...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 1!{vspace=5}Toxicity level increased!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 1!
{cps=50}...yet every caravan that arrives in the city makes your pockets heavier with another precious trinket with which the French pay for your services.
{cps=50}In the end, when the time comes to leave the outpost, you depart as a significantly richer person than you were on arrival.
{cps=50}In response he informs you, in a very chilled tone, that if you like being a saint, they will leave you be. But they will expect the same from you.
{cps=50}And if you attempt to put spokes in their wheels, nobody will hold long discussions to dissuade you.
{cps=50}That same night, while standing guard, you witness a caravan of half a dozen wagons attempting to enter the city under cover of darkness...
{cps=50}You are just about to raise the alarm, but then quickly realize that you have no idea how exactly your 'comrades' will behave - and against whom will they turn their weapons...
{cps=50}Understanding quite well that one wrong move could cost you your life, you decide just to pretend nothing is happening.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 20!
{cps=50}A relatively similar scenario is repeated several more times during your stay at the outpost. Wagons with provisions and small reinforcements arrive in the city, and all you can do is watch in silence.
{cps=50}Sleepless nights and modest (at times downright meager) nutrition exhaust you...

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 1!
{cps=50}Time, however, runs its course, your stay at the remote outpost is gradually coming to an end, and soon you are rotated back to the main camp.
{cps=50}You haven't made any extensive connections among the soldiers, and thus you naturally don't find any acquaintances at the outpost.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) check failed!
{cps=50}That same night you, in the company of one of the old inhabitants of the outpost, go on your first guard duty.
{cps=50}Shortly after midnight, your partner suggests you take a nap and says that he will stay on duty on his own for a while. He promises to wake you up in case of emergency.
{cps=50}You agree without a second thought.
{cps=50}Your partner, as promised, wakes you up a couple of hours later, and you quietly finish your guard duty.
{cps=50}Food at the outpost turns out to be quite scarce, so any opportunity to save energy comes in handy. Therefore, when it's your turn to stand watch at night again, you readily accept the offer to take a nap.
{cps=50}Despite earlier concerns, the situation at the outpost ends up being quite calm - the French do not disturb you with sorties, and the deputy does not load you with hard work.
{cps=50}Thus, one by one, your vigils pass, and soon, once your tour of duty at the outpost is up, you return to the main camp.
{cps=50}The idea of a 'little nap' on combat duty doesn't seem so great to you, and you decline.
{cps=50}In response your partner suggests that you freshen up a bit and race down to the creek for water.
{cps=50}Deferring to his seniority, you go where you were told, however, something inside keeps you on the edge.
{cps=50}Everything looks as if there was an attempt to hide something from you...
{cps=50}After quietly sneaking back, you witness a caravan of half a dozen wagons attempting to enter the city under cover of darkness, all the while your partner, who also sees it perfectly well, calmly observes.
{cps=50}Noticing your appearance, he orders you to keep your mouth shut and, pulling a jingling pouch with florins from his pocket, looks at you questioningly.
{cps=50}After a bit of consideration, you dismiss these thoughts and decide not to fill your head with unnecessary nonsense.
{cps=50}On the following nights, when it is your turn to stand guard again, the situation repeats itself a couple of times - around midnight your partners from among the more experienced soldiers sometimes send you somewhere away.
{cps=50}However, you obediently run their errands and everything goes smoothly.
{cps=50}Sleepless nights and modest (at times downright meager) nutrition exhaust you...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 1!{vspace=5}Toxicity level increased!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 1!
{cps=50}Thus, one by one, your vigils pass, and soon, once your tour of duty at the outpost is up, you return to the main camp.
{cps=50}He says nothing, but you can figure it out without words.
{cps=50}Feeling its pleasant weight in your palm, you decide that looking inside and counting the coins will be much more interesting than watching the caravan move to the city.
{cps=50}A relatively similar scenario is repeated several more times during your stay at the outpost.
{cps=50}Sleepless nights and modest (at times downright meager) nutrition exhaust you...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 1!{vspace=5}Toxicity level increased!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 1!
{cps=50}...yet every caravan that arrives in the city makes your pockets heavier with another handful of coins.
{cps=50}In the end, when the time comes to leave the outpost, you depart as a considerably richer person than you were on arrival.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}100 florins received!
{cps=50}Hearing your and the outpost deputy commander's mutual accusations and two completely different versions of what happened — the deputy swears that it was you and the new arrivals who were bribed by the French — the sergeant prefers to arrest you all and bring you to the camp for a full trial.
{cps=50}At the main camp, the commanding officers listen to both sides' versions and render a verdict...
{cps=50}In your favor!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers), Prestige, Rank, Reputation (the earl), the surviving men of the deputy check passed!
{cps=50}The deputy[quest_decider!ti] is sent to a date with the executioner, while you are cleared of all charges and even thanked for your incorruptibility and loyalty to the oath.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) increased by 5!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 10!{vspace=5}50 florins received!
{cps=50}Not in your favor!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers), Prestige, Rank, Reputation (the earl), the surviving men of the deputy check failed!
{cps=50}Words of the deputy[quest_decider!ti] turn out to have more weight than yours and the command takes his side.
{cps=50}Initially they want to send you to a date with the executioner, but the earl intervenes and resolves that war is not the time for squandering people, deciding instead that you will lead the next attack on the city walls. You will either die by the enemy's sword or earn forgiveness with your blood and valor.
{cps=50}In the meantime, to teach you a lesson in subordination, he orders you to be flogged and put in a pit for a day or two.
{cps=50}Sitting in a cold pit with fresh and still bleeding wounds from the rods could have been quite detrimental for your health if not for Bartholomew who has visited you several times with medicines.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality decreased by 1!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 20!{vspace=5}Reputation (the earl) decreased by 15!{vspace=5}Prestige reduced by 2!{vspace=5}Toxicity increased by 10!

{cps=50}When the time comes to take you out of the pit, it is the sergeant himself who arrives. Keeping some distance and choosing his words carefully, he nevertheless makes it clear that he believes in your innocence and that he is sorry you are being punished in this way.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}The situation on the battlefield is changing. The battle might soon come to an end...
{cps=50}The surviving foes are hastily retreating...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}The battle does not last even fifteen minutes - clearly not expecting you to show up, the French quickly abandon plans to break through into the city and prefer to retreat.
{cps=50}The deputy and the old inhabitants of the outpost are understandably furious because of your actions, but you don't pay much attention to their wrath, figuring that the sounds of battle are guaranteed to attract the attention of other sentries and lookouts who will alert the main camp.
{cps=50}And it won't be long before a superior will show up here, so you will be able to tell him the truth about what happened.
{cps=50}At first, this plan seems quite proper to you, but it quickly becomes obvious that you did not take something into account...
{cps=50}Without asking unnecessary questions or wasting time on discussions, the deputy and his men bare their weapons and rush at the new arrivals who've helped you in the battle. And, having been taken by surprise, one by one they are quickly sent to the afterlife.
{cps=50}In just a few minutes, the only 'honest' person left on the outpost is you...
{cps=50}Hoping to hold out until the arrival of the men from the main camp, you decide to fight...
{cps=50}Skeptical of your chances to fend off the deputy and his men, you make a run for it.
{cps=50}Thanks to your agility and endurance, you manage to break away from your pursuers a little.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility, endurance check passed!
{cps=50}The adversaries are desperately chasing you and are seemingly about to catch up with you, but, at that moment, a squad of cavalrymen led by the sergeant appears ahead on the road.
{cps=50}But they quickly catch up with you...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility, endurance check failed!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!

{cps=50}But they quickly catch up with you...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility, Endurance, Coordination check failed!
{cps=50}You hear the noise of approaching horsemen. Perhaps if you hold on a little longer, someone will come to your aid...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}By failing to quickly deal with the defenders of this part of the wall, you give them the opportunity to call for reinforcements, and the balance of forces begins to change dramatically in favor of the adversary...
{cps=50}After lightning-fast annihilation of the handful of Duncan's men defending this part of the wall, you burst inside the castle...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Do you loot the bodies?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}As you move through the corridors and towers, you kill the sentries one by one. After a quarter of an hour, Chippenham Castle is almost under your control.
{cps=50}Only Duncan's bodyguards, who guard the marquis's private quarters, are able to offer some semblance of organized resistance.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Do you loot the bodies?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Heaving dealt with the marquis's bodyguards, you kick in the door to his chambers and rush inside.
{cps=50}Just in time to find yourself face to face with Duncan, who is dragging a heavy trunk towards a small side door.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}News of the catastrophic failure of the operation plunges Alyssa into great anxiety...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [duncans_revenge.name!ti].{vspace=5}New quest added - [unfinished_business_alyssa.name!ti].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}He points to the trunk.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}He pushes the trunk in your direction with his foot and extends his hand for a handshake.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You shift your weapon to the left hand and accept Duncan's handshake.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Sighing with obvious relief, Duncan breaks into a smile.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You clench his hand in yours and yank him towards yourself, making him lose his balance and collapse to his knees beside you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}He opens his mouth in an attempt to respond, but you preempt him by bringing the blade of your sword down on his neck and swiftly severing his head.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And Chippenham, for the second time this year, loses its marquis.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You rapidly thrust your sword blade into Duncan's throat, and the nervous smile on the marquis's face slowly turns into an ugly grimace.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Grasping his slit throat in a vain attempt to stop the blood, Duncan loses his balance and stumbles over his own trunk.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The lid of the trunk he hit opens, revealing jumbled mountains of jewelry and coins, which the marquis generously showers with his blood as he falls to the floor.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And Chippenham, for the second time this year, loses its marquis.
{cps=50}Duncan's death does not bring Alyssa back, nor does it soothe the pain from her loss.
{cps=50}Yet breathing becomes a little easier.
{cps=50}And the protracted story of the confrontation between Countess Caldwell and the rebellious peasants finally comes to an end.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After giving your people the rest of the day to loot the castle, the next morning you turn back and safely return to your lands.{vspace=5}7000 florins lost!
{cps=50}Duncan's death relieves you of the burden of your promise to Alyssa.
{cps=50}And the protracted story of the confrontation between Countess Caldwell and the rebellious peasants finally comes to an end.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After giving your people the rest of the day to loot the castle, the next morning you turn back and safely return to your lands.{vspace=5}7000 florins lost!
{cps=50}Duncan's death becomes the natural finale of his life and the charge for his exorbitant ambition.
{cps=50}Blinded by success and impunity, he dared to dictate terms to the crown itself, expecting to take advantage of its weakness.
{cps=50}But he forgot that the crown's weakness tends to be replaced by strength. And then all those who have raised their heads too high above the ground have to duck swiftly.
{cps=50}Otherwise one might lose his head.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After giving your people the rest of the day to loot the castle, the next morning you turn back and safely return to your lands.{vspace=5}7000 florins lost!
{cps=50}King Edward thanks you for carrying out his assignment.
{cps=50}A propaganda campaign launched by Alyssa through paid gossipers, innkeepers, and heralds spreads the rumors that pious Aldous Mortimer has returned to Chippenham not only to avenge his murdered relative but also to finally bring peace and order to these lands.
{cps=50}Exhausted by a long series of bloody confrontations, the locals accept the new authority with resignation, and Aldous' family ties to the late John Mortimer completely eliminate the question of its legitimacy.
{cps=50}As for 'pious and wise' Aldous, he proves to be docile and unassuming.
{cps=50}Having changed the straw mattress of a cheap inn to the down featherbed of the marquis's private quarters and cheap drinks from the tavern to imported wines, which can now also be consumed in a company of young minxes, he is completely content with life and obediently plays the role assigned to him.
{cps=50}Alyssa's venture doesn't just work out - it works absolutely perfectly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Sitting in Chippenham's picturesque castle garden, you and Alyssa enjoy a bottle of wine recommended to you by Aldous.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Savoring her glass, Alyssa mocks you, making her voice sound like a child's cry.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Finishing the rest of the contents of her glass in one gulp, Alyssa melancholically tosses it away, shattering the French glass against a rock.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You open your mouth to respond, but Alyssa gestures for you to stop.
{cps=50}Alyssa's words sound convincing, but you don't particularly need to be persuaded.
{cps=50}Your entire short, yet extremely eventful military career has been nothing but one endless and dizzying upward surge.
{cps=50}Behind all the prince's and the earl's recent successes have been your ingenuity, your courage, and your spilled blood.
{cps=50}And now, in London, these two still need your help. Their success still depends on you...
{cps=50}But not yours on them.
{cps=50}Alyssa is right: the throne of the kingdom is right in front of you and all that is left is to step forward and take it.
{cps=50}And you decide you're ready to take that step. Yes, this is a betrayal, but the end, as is well known, justifies the means, and the winners are not judged.
{cps=50}Especially if the winner is the king.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 75!
{cps=50}The plan you and Alyssa devise is simple: use all available resources to gather as many men as possible in a short time at the camp under Windsor, then move swiftly on the capital to arrest Prince Edward and Northampton.
{cps=50}After that you are supposed to act on the situation.
{cps=50}You remark that there are no royal regalia in the capital, so you won't be able to get crowned immediately, but Alyssa dismisses this, stating that such a chance should not be missed in any case.
{cps=50}According to her, the fact that Canterbury currently owns the regalia does not make him king. And so their absence won't hinder you.
{cps=50}The main objective is to seize the throne and secure it by the right of the strongest. Everything else, including any official ceremonies, can wait.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [march_on_london.name!ti].
{cps=50}You gather a large detachment and head for Chippenham, intending to put an end to the Duncan story once and for all.
{cps=50}Noticing your approach in advance, the castle's guardsmen raise the alarm and prepare for defense.
{cps=50}Once in the past, this perhaps would have stopped you, but now, with Cambrai[ruffin_killed!ti] under your belt, you are prepared to storm Chippenham single-handedly if necessary.
{cps=50}Leading your men, you are the first to scale and burst onto the fortress wall...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}By failing to quickly deal with the defenders of this part of the wall, you give them the opportunity to call for reinforcements, and the balance of forces begins to change dramatically in favor of the adversary...
{cps=50}After securing the wall, you fend off several counterattacks from the defenders.
{cps=50}Seeing that the wall has been captured, Duncan's men retreat into the castle's interior...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Do you loot the bodies?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Despite their rather large numbers, the castle's defenders clearly lack motivation and fighting spirit.
{cps=50}Sensing the intensity of your onslaught and seeing that you are ready to fight to the death, they begin to rapidly give up their positions, caring only about preserving their lives.
{cps=50}The organized resistance of the defenders of Chippenham is broken.
{cps=50}After issuing your orders and instructing your detachment to continue sweeping the castle, you rush to the marquis's chambers and kick the door open.
{cps=50}Just in time to find yourself face to face with Duncan, who is dragging a heavy trunk towards a small side door.
{cps=50}You deploy your forces and make a speech before them, in which you accuse Prince Edward of usurpation of power and a bloodthirsty desire to continue a murderous internecine war.
{cps=50}You promise each of the soldiers a rich reward, as well as the opportunity to return home soon, and announce that the army is marching on London in order to take control of the capital and arrest the prince.
{cps=50}Without wasting any time, you leave the camp and march towards the capital.
{cps=50}You meet no resistance as you move through the city streets and reach the royal residence.
{cps=50}When offered to lay down their arms and let you and your men through to the prince, Edward's bodyguards naturally refuse, so you have to break through them by force...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}With the prince's guards out of the way and your men in full control of the residence, you decide it's time to do what you came here for.
{cps=50}You find Prince Edward in the throne room.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The prince draws his sword from its scabbard.
{cps=50}As you watch felled Prince Edward bleed, you realize with concern that the plan Alyssa has devised seems to show cracks. The bloodless arrest of the prince turns into his murder, Northampton, who was also supposed to be arrested, is nowhere to be found, and the capital, which was supposed to humbly accept its new sovereign, begins to buzz like a restless beehive.
{cps=50}From the windows of the royal residence you can clearly see the surrounding squares and streets, rapidly filling with crowds of gawkers who watch with interest the coup d'état unfolding in the heart of the city.
{cps=50}The current situation appears far from ideal. And, worst of all, you have a poor understanding of what to do about it and how to proceed.
{cps=50}Alyssa's arrival changes things. Energetic and self-confident, she immediately gets to work.
{cps=50}Following the scheme tried and tested in Chippenham, she spreads all sorts of rumors and gossip around the city, painting a favorable picture for you: denigrating the prince and making you look like the long-awaited savior of the kingdom from ruinous wars and extortionate fees.
{cps=50}As for the royal court, most of its members don't even need to be convinced of anything. For these people, as Northampton said, are willing to serve anyone as long as they are well paid and their asses are kept safe.
{cps=50}Thanks to big promises, as well as generous gifts that drain the last florins from the already emptied treasury, you and Alyssa manage to get most of the key people in the capital, responsible for the security of London and its outskirts, as well as for the administration of affairs in the kingdom, on your side.
{cps=50}You manage to avoid an immediate crisis, but the real work of consolidating power is just ahead...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Due to the treasury's depletion, at first you will have to rely solely on your resources and savings.
{cps=50}This information, along with rumors spread by Alyssa's agents, creates an extremely attractive image of you in the eyes of most of the lower class.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check passed!
{cps=50}A kind, just, and pious king, raised by God's grace from the very bottom to finally end all wars and establish peace and order.
{cps=50}People like this story, and you garner support among the common folk.
{cps=50}As a result, public opinion among the lower class ends up heavily biased not in your favor.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check failed!
{cps=50}Meanwhile, events around the capital run their course. Northampton, who has slipped through your hands, shows up first in Dartford and then in Maidstone, where all the other opponents of your regime are quickly flocking to.
{cps=50}By splitting the loyalist camp in two, you have deprived it of a substantial part of its forces. However, given the proactive and cunning nature of the earl, there is little doubt that he would find a way out of this situation.
{cps=50}At the same time, there are rumors of increasing activity at the Oxford rebel camp. Canterbury is preparing to strike, and the repulse of that attack, apparently, will be your first test as master of the throne.
{cps=50}Realizing the overall precariousness of your situation along with the presence of enemies in both the west and east, you, on the advice of Alyssa and the new privy council established by her, decide to dissolve the Parliament and be crowned immediately.
{cps=50}But not as king of England, but as king of the newly formed Kingdom of London, which includes the capital with its outskirts, Greenwich, Chippenham, Hadley, and other domains loyal to you, whose lords are willing to swear allegiance to the new sovereign.
{cps=50}Thus begins the first year of your reign.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9A9}{i}Number of troops: [kingdom_of_london_army] soldiers{vspace=5}Available funds: [player_gold] florins
{cps=50}You don't wish to face the count's army in a field battle and decide to prepare London for the siege.
{cps=50}You've managed to stockpile enough provisions for X months of siege.
{cps=50}Upon approaching the city, Count Canterbury's troops encircle it and, after about a month-long siege, launch a major assault at last.
{cps=50}You and your men face the enemy on the walls.
{cps=50}However, there is nowhere for you to retreat, for the outcome of this battle will determine the fate of the entire Kingdom of London...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}In an effort to boost your troop numbers, you attract all available mercenary companies and units that exist in this part of the kingdom to your side!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}1000 mercenaries hired!{vspace=5}50,000 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}The defenders of London manage to repel the assault, and Canterbury's troops retreat to Oxford with heavy losses.
{cps=50}You pass your first test as king with flying colors, but now, having repelled an enemy attack on the capital, you find yourself facing a truly difficult question...
{cps=50}Should you once again put everything on the line and organize your own military campaign against Oxford, in an attempt to finally crush the rebels and gain control of most of the kingdom...
{cps=50}Or choose not to risk your life and crown, but instead focus on consolidating power and bringing order to the lands you already hold under your control.
{cps=50}After a failed assault on the capital and a disorderly retreat from its walls, Canterbury has ended up in a vulnerable position and you've got a real chance to defeat him. The second such opportunity may never be presented again, so you are willing to take a risk.
{cps=50}You gather all available troops and march on Oxford.
{cps=50}Bereft of solid fortifications, the city that Canterbury chose as his base of operations could not be expected to withstand a long siege. So it was up to the battered rebel army to defend it in a field battle.
{cps=50}Skillfully taking advantage of the terrain, the count places his troops on top of several hills, which are flanked by a forest and a river. You have no choice but to attack him head-on, hoping to crush the rebels with brute force.
{cps=50}War has brought you to the throne, and now your heart is aching for another campaign to crush your enemies and earn even more riches and glory.
{cps=50}But you are no longer an ordinary soldier or a knight following orders. You are a king, and now too much depends on your decisions. Failure at Oxford could easily not only undo all your accomplishments, depriving you of both crown and life, but also doom Alyssa, who, without your protection, is guaranteed to be hanged. Or to suffer a much worse fate.
{cps=50}In these circumstances, you make a decision that you feel is the only right one. A decision not of a warrior, but of a king.
{cps=50}And instead of marching troops on Oxford, you send there emissaries to propose an armistice.
{cps=50}In the meantime, you are actively working to restore order in the war-weary lands that are part of the Kingdom of London, which has just proved its right to exist.
{cps=50}After about another six months of minor clashes and small raids on each other's territory, Canterbury, exhausted by the war as much as you are, very reluctantly agrees to sit down with you at the negotiating table.
{cps=50}Table, which the two of you have to share with the Duke of Cambridge, as well as Northampton, who has managed in a short time to once again assemble a capable army and establish a solid foothold in the southern part of England.
{cps=50}The first negotiation attempt fails because of the unwillingness of all parties to make any concessions to each other, and, separately, because of the general contempt of Northampton, Canterbury, and Cambridge for you.
{cps=50}Contempt so strong and unifying, that you seriously begin to fear that all three might forget about their mutual hatred for a while just to settle scores with you.
{cps=50}These fears are confirmed and, in the late spring of the following year, as soon as the snow melts away, the young Kingdom of London is once again under attack. But, this time, by three armies at once - from Oxford, Cambridge, and Maidstone.
{cps=50}In this seemingly hopeless predicament Alyssa finds salvation by sending an envoy to the court of the Scottish king, promising him support and territorial concessions in exchange for help in preserving the kingdom's sovereignty.
{cps=50}You have little faith in the success of this diplomatic mission, since according to numerous rumors, the Scots have long been engaged in some kind of secret negotiations with both Oxford and Cambridge. However, the situation is saved by two coincidences.
{cps=50}Firstly, the embassy sent north by Alyssa is led by [ally!ti], your comrade-in-arms, as well as a bard and troubadour gifted with incredible eloquence. And, secondly, in Edinburgh he is met by the young Scottish king James Bruce - an intelligent person not bereft of pragmatism, but, due to his age, very prone to idealism.
{cps=50}After receiving Alyssa's envoy, the young king is not only impressed by his oratory but also takes a sort of sympathy on you, seeing you as a young upstart like himself, standing alone against the whole world.
{cps=50}And, in the end, agrees to help you in exchange for your support of his plans to annex some of the northern lands, which are nominally part of the English kingdom, but practically not controlled by anyone since the outbreak of the internecine war.
{cps=50}The intervention of the Scots forces the war that has just erupted to subside again and the four masters of the English lands gather again at the negotiating table - this time with James as mediator.
{cps=50}Unprepared to face a full-fledged Scottish army, Northampton, Canterbury, and Cambridge are forced to accept the new reality - the Kingdom of England ceases to exist, giving way to four new territorial entities with centers in London, Oxford, Cambridge, and Maidstone.
{cps=50}With royal relics in possession, Count Canterbury, in a sense, follows your example and is soon also crowned, but as king of all England.
{cps=50}In reality, though, his power extends solely to Oxford, its environs, and allied domains, so soon enough he becomes known by a more fitting title - King of Oxford.
{cps=50}The Duke of Cambridge's domain remains a duchy, but he himself no longer has a suzerain and pursues free policy, maneuvering between all forces present in the region and joining the most advantageous alliances.
{cps=50}After the duke's death, the question of the ownership of his domain leads to a dispute between you and Canterbury, which you, with the support of your new personal friend James Bruce, resolve in your favor.
{cps=50}As for Earl Northampton, he gradually unites all the lands to the south and partly southwest of London under his rule and forms the county of Maidstone, living mostly off sea trade with the Continent.
{cps=50}For many decades to come, this division of the once single kingdom becomes the new status quo, which, despite numerous attempts, neither side can change.
{cps=50}And your legacy, which you pass on to your descendants and which will be written next to your name in historical treatises, ends up being this kingdom split into four pieces, weakened and mired in petty internal conflicts.
{cps=50}Such is fate. As a truly exceptional warrior, you dared to reach for the stars and try on the royal crown. You had the strength to seize it in a moment of chaos and universal weakness, but couldn't accomplish anything else.
{cps=50}Having amused your own vanity and inflated your ego, this gambit brought nothing to the rest of the kingdom but another series of ruinous and bloody wars, the loss of many of the borderlands that were snatched away by the neighbors, and long decades of instability.
{cps=50}When you had a chance to secure for yourself a tiny but respectable place in history as an unrivaled warrior and a man loyal to duty, you decided to aim higher. And you got what you wanted, going down in history as a king and leaving a truly big mark in the annals.
{cps=50}Except that now, instead of words 'dignity' and 'valor', your name on the pages of treatises is often neighbored with the terms 'treachery', 'usurpation', and 'tyranny'.
{cps=50}You'll remain on the throne for almost three decades, outliving Canterbury, Northampton, and even King James, who will die in a war in France, where he would go to help his allies. You will meet your death from sickness in your own bed, surrounded by a loving wife and numerous children, to the eldest of whom you will pass the crown.
{cps=50}However, your established dynasty is not destined to last, and two years after your death England will be plunged into war yet again, which will reunite the fragments of the former kingdom into a single whole. Your dynasty will be trampled, and the few surviving descendants will be scattered across Europe.
{cps=50}But this, however, is a completely different story.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 20 of 19.
{cps=50}You gather all available troops and once again organize the defense of the capital, but this time the forces are too unequal, and after a short siege London is captured by the armies of the triple alliance.
{cps=50}You fall in battle while defending the gates of the royal residence with few loyal men, and Alyssa takes poison in her bedroom while watching from a window as enemy flags are raised one by one on the fortress walls.
{cps=50}The newly created Kingdom of London disappears from the face of the earth as a misunderstanding, the memory of which will not even be preserved in annals and treatises.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 21 of 19.
{cps=50}Seeing that the battle is turning not in your favor, you order a retreat and withdraw back to London, bringing the situation back to the status quo.
{cps=50}Having exchanged unsuccessful blows with Canterbury, you both appear unable to continue intense fighting.
{cps=50}The count's tactical prowess cannot compensate for the exhaustion of his troops. The rebels begin the battle confidently and withstand your first blow, but as soon as it is followed by the second and third, Canterbury's army begins to crumble.
{cps=50}Advance units begin to retreat in disarray, and there are no reserves to plug the resulting holes. The battle ends with your complete victory in less than a few hours.
{cps=50}Canterbury himself is killed during a retreat at the hands of men of one of his allies, who has decided to switch to your side and seek forgiveness that way.
{cps=50}With the count dead and his army destroyed, there can be no further armed resistance. One by one, the rebellious lords who were on Canterbury's side either crawl to you on their knees and beg for mercy or hastily abandon their estates and flee - to the north, to the Continent, or to the narrow strip of southern land controlled by Northampton.
{cps=50}After taking possession of the royal relics, you triumphantly return to London, one step closer to becoming a full-fledged ruler of all England.
{cps=50}During your departure from the capital for the Oxford campaign, Northampton with his trusted men tries to organize a daring raid and break into the city, but thanks to Alyssa's vigilance, this scheme falls through. The earl fails to covertly infiltrate the city walls, and there is simply too little manpower for him to assault London.
{cps=50}Having finished with Canterbury, you intend to tackle the 'County of Maidstone' immediately, but your troops' exhaustion forces a long pause in the fighting.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of this break, Northampton rapidly weaves his web of intrigue and organizes a series of assassination attempts on your inner circle and you personally.
{cps=50}The opportunity to experience the earl's ingenuity on your own skin for the first time is presented to you during the negotiations with the Duke of Cambridge on a hunting trip when several men from your retinue suddenly point their crossbows at you...
{cps=50}The bodyguards who came to the rescue quickly deal with the assassins.
{cps=50}Despite failing to achieve its immediate goal, the assassination attempt orchestrated by Northampton succeeds in something else - disrupting negotiations between you and Cambridge, as well as poisoning your relationship with strong mutual suspicion.
{cps=50}The alliance already outlined after your victory over Canterbury is now impossible, and the duke begins to look for allies in the north - in the Scottish kingdom.
{cps=50}The earl, meanwhile, doesn't give up his attempts to take your life, and about a week after the hunting incident, two assassins swoop down on you in your own chambers...
{cps=50}The bodyguards who came to the rescue quickly deal with the assassins.
{cps=50}After surviving several assassination attempts you get more cautious, reorganize your security, and decide to immediately address the 'Maidstone question'.
{cps=50}Northampton's loyal troops try to oppose your army, but the balance of power is too unequal.
{cps=50}After capturing Dartford almost without a fight, you rapidly advance southward and, in a series of small battles around Maidstone, defeat all of the earl's assembled detachments in detail before seizing the town itself.
{cps=50}The second enemy pocket of resistance is now also destroyed, and the conducted military campaign is so brilliant that it will be soon celebrated in songs.
{cps=50}The only fly in the ointment is Northampton, who once again, just as back in London, predictably slipped out of your hands and disappeared in an unknown direction.
{cps=50}However, now deprived of all resources and allies, he is hardly a threat to you.
{cps=50}The Duchy of Cambridge remains the only independent fragment of the old kingdom not subject to London. Playing hard to get and waiting for a better opportunity, the duke missed the chance to join either Canterbury or Northampton and ended up alone with you.
{cps=50}A year or especially two years ago you were quite willing to make serious concessions to get him on your side, but that time has long passed.
{cps=50}However, the duke has still got a trump card up his sleeve - an alliance with the Scots, which has fully materialized while you were busy closing the Maidstone question definitively.
{cps=50}After crossing the northern border, which has long remained unprotected by anyone, Scottish troops rush south.
{cps=50}Realizing that they are aiming to join forces with the Duke of Cambridge's troops, you nevertheless decide not to rush in a hurry to defeat them in detail, but on the contrary, spend all available time assembling an army and mobilizing all available resources.
{cps=50}The failed expedition to France and the subsequent protracted internecine war have led to the devastation of many lands of the kingdom and the depletion of the treasury, but, on the other hand, left behind a huge number of veterans - battle-hardened men who had gone through many fights and gained invaluable experience.
{cps=50}The Cambridge and Scottish forces, on the other hand, are far fresher, so most of them don't have even a quarter of such expertise.
{cps=50}With your rich experience in waging wars and personally participating in them, you know well that one experienced soldier, led by a capable commander, could be worth five or even ten recruits. Therefore, having gathered a full army of seasoned veterans, you could well expect to defeat the combined forces of Cambridge and the Scots in a pitched battle.
{cps=50}You are about to test the truth of this belief on a plain between Cambridge and London, where the two armies have met for a general battle.
{cps=50}After arranging your troops according to a disposition conceived in advance, you move forward at the head of your soldiers. As soon as you are spotted on the battlefield, one of the noble Scottish knights immediately directs his squad straight at you...
{cps=50}The victory over the enemy knight inspires the soldiers and becomes a signal for your army to launch an all-out attack.
{cps=50}Intending to break through the center of the Scottish position and split the opposing army in two, you strike at the three pike squares that form the middle of the entire enemy formation.
{cps=50}Seeing your attack cleave his army in half, the Scottish king makes a desperate attempt to save the situation and throws forward a squad of heavily armed knights from among his personal bodyguards.
{cps=50}Split in two, the combined army of the Scots and the Duke of Cambridge quickly loses organization, turning into an uncontrollable crowd of men.
{cps=50}An unsuccessful attack of the knights becomes the enemy's last attempt to turn the tide, but it all proves futile.
{cps=50}Thanks to your decisive actions combined with the experience and resilience of your veterans who have been through many fights, the battle is won.
{cps=50}Faced with the choice of pursuing either the duke or the Scottish king, you go for the former.
{cps=50}The duke fails to repeat Northampton's vanishing trick - your people catch up with him in the vicinity of his family estate, and a week later an executioner solemnly cuts off his head in one of the London squares.
{cps=50}With the duke's death, the retreat of the Scots, and the restoration of control over the northern border, the lengthy period of chaos that split the kingdom into several fragments and almost destroyed it completely comes to its end at last.
{cps=50}Deaths, or in the case of Northampton - disappearance, of England's largest landowners opens up a great scope for redistribution of the holdings. By rewarding distinguished allies with rich estates, you strengthen ties with the old aristocracy, as well as form the new layer — from people loyal to you personally.
{cps=50}As a result, the crisis of relations between the aristocracy and the monarch, which in part prompted many lords, led by Count Canterbury, to oppose the rightful heir of the deceased king, is completely overcome.
{cps=50}Once crowned - now as the proper sovereign of the entire English kingdom - you establish your own dynasty that will rule England for over a hundred years.
{cps=50}As for you personally, you'll remain on the throne for almost three decades. You will meet your death from sickness in your own bed, surrounded by a loving wife and numerous children, to the eldest of whom you will pass the crown.
{cps=50}You go down in history as one of the highly controversial, but still great characters.
{cps=50}An unrivaled warrior who broke his sworn oath of loyalty to fulfill his own vision of the future for the kingdom.
{cps=50}A skillful strategist, who not only survived while surrounded by enemies, but also managed to emerge victorious from an unequal battle through blood and steel.
{cps=50}A true monarch who took over the reins of a kingdom weak and divided, but with determination and ruthlessness brought the disparate lands together and made the nobles respect the crown again.
{cps=50}Such is your legacy.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 22 of 19.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell Alyssa about the diplomatic mission entrusted to you by Northampton.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell Alyssa about your trip to Chippenham and a meeting with Duncan.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After listening to you carefully, she makes a thoughtful face.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You've got nothing to discuss with Alyssa at the moment.
{cps=50}When a panting courier seeks you out to deliver some urgent news, you immediately realize that something serious has happened.
{cps=50}The concerned expression on the messenger's face and the delicately fearful tone with which he starts the conversation tell you everything you need to know before he even says it out loud.
{cps=50}Alyssa...
{cps=50}The Caldwell estate in Greenwich is looted and burnt by unknown assailants. No survivors.
{cps=50}Not being prone to sentimentality and drama, you don't shed oceans of tears, tear your hair out, or fall to your knees.
{cps=50}But that doesn't mean you don't feel pain.
{cps=50}Alyssa is dead. And she has died not least because of you.
{cps=50}It was you who first missed Duncan at Greenwich, then failed to deal with him at Chippenham, and then failed to protect Alyssa from him, preferring to concentrate on more important matters.
{cps=50}Exactly as she had feared.
{cps=50}Due to the religiosity of your nature, you cannot help but note that there was something providentially natural in Alyssa's demise...{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue check passed!
{cps=50}She fought peasant uprisings with hot iron and did not compromise even when dialogue could probably have been initiated.
{cps=50}Vindictiveness made her renew her war with Duncan even when he seemed to have forgotten all about it.
{cps=50}And sent her to the grave.
{cps=50}However, natural or not, Alyssa's death has become a dagger in your heart and a stain on your reputation.
{cps=50}Duncan must answer for what he has done.

{cps=50}As soon as you arrive in the capital, you are immediately summoned by the earl for a discussion.
{cps=50}Obeying the earl's order, you hand over command of the Windsor military camp to Thomas Marshall and step down as town commandant.
{cps=50}You've made a verbal agreement with Alyssa to organize a march on London but never found the strength to take this step.
{cps=50}And now, with your loss of control of the Windsor camp, that opportunity is lost for good.
{cps=50}The news of the collapse of your plans predictably infuriates Alyssa, but as you rationalize what happened, you can't get rid of the thought that in the end, everything appears to have turned for the better.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Draining her entire glass in one gulp, Alyssa melancholically tosses it away, shattering the expensive French glass against a rock.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You open your mouth to respond, but Alyssa gestures for you to stop.
{cps=50}After assessing the available forces in the Windsor camp, you conclude that they are not yet enough for a march on the capital...{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Not enough militiamen!{vspace=5}Required: 100.

{cps=50}Having exhausted the city's defenders with a long siege, Canterbury finally orders a major assault.
{cps=50}You and your men face the enemy on the walls.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}Due to the losses sustained during the defense of the capital, the expiration of mercenary contracts, and the withdrawal of some of the allies' regiments, your current number of troops is [kingdom_of_london_army].
{cps=50}Trophies collected on the battlefield allow you to replenish the treasury with 30,000 florins.
{cps=50}Furthermore, by the end of the battle your men manage to capture [kingdom_of_london_prisoners_captured] enemy warriors, including several notable knights, for whom you are guaranteed to receive a nice ransom...
{cps=50}After a failed assault on the capital and a disorderly retreat from its walls, Canterbury has ended up in a vulnerable position and you've got a real chance to crush him. The second such opportunity may never be presented again, so you are willing to take a risk.
{cps=50}You gather all available troops and march on Oxford.
{cps=50}Bereft of solid fortifications, the city that Canterbury chose as his base of operations could not be expected to withstand a long siege. So it was up to the battered rebel army to defend it in a field battle.
{cps=50}Skillfully taking advantage of the terrain, the count places his troops on top of several hills, which are flanked by a forest and a river. You have no choice but to attack him head-on, hoping to crush the rebels with brute force.
{cps=50}You don't have enough troops to march on Oxford!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Current number of troops: [kingdom_of_london_army] soldiers{vspace=5}Required for the campaign: [kingdom_of_london_can_continue_campaign].
{cps=50}War has brought you to the throne, and now your heart is aching for another campaign to crush your enemies and earn even more riches and glory.
{cps=50}But you are no longer an ordinary soldier or a knight following orders. You are a king, and now too much depends on your decisions. Failure at Oxford could easily not only undo all your accomplishments, depriving you of both crown and life, but also doom Alyssa, who, without your protection, is guaranteed to be hanged. Or to suffer a much worse fate.
{cps=50}In these circumstances, you make a decision that you feel is the only right one. A decision not of a warrior, but of a king.
{cps=50}And instead of marching troops on Oxford, you send there emissaries to propose an armistice.
{cps=50}In the meantime, you are actively working to restore order in the war-weary lands that are part of the Kingdom of London, which has just proved its right to exist.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You glance over Canterbury and Cambridge, who are not in a hurry to make their inputs.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Duke of Cambridge, who kept silent until now, also takes word.
{cps=50}The utterly failed first attempt at negotiations is followed by the onset of frosts, which puts all hostilities on pause.
{cps=50}A snowy and harsh winter delivers a powerful blow to the already half-alive economy of the young kingdom.
{cps=50}The war-torn lands, which have lost their economic ties due to the new borders, can barely sustain themselves - supporting a large royal army is out of the question.
{cps=50}With the arrival of spring, your forces number no more than a couple of hundred men.
{cps=50}Realizing that fending off three combined armies with such a detachment will not be possible even in the wildest dreams, you can only hope that the tenuous alliance of Northampton, Canterbury, and Cambridge has had time to crack, if not completely collapse, over the winter months, and an immediate resumption of war will not follow.
{cps=50}But as soon as the snow finally melts away, your worst fears are confirmed and the young Kingdom of London is once again under attack. And, this time, by three armies at once - from Oxford, Cambridge, and Maidstone.
{cps=50}With royal relics in possession, Count Canterbury, in a sense, follows your example and is soon also crowned, but as king of all England.
{cps=50}In reality, though, his power extends solely to Oxford, its environs, and allied domains, so soon enough he becomes known by a more fitting title - King of Oxford.
{cps=50}After the duke's death from a sudden illness, his only heir is his daughter, who was never married off due to the duke's endless searches for the most advantageous and diplomatically promising match for her.
{cps=50}Being quite a dainty piece, the Duchy of Cambridge immediately becomes the subject of intense scrutiny in both London and Oxford.
{cps=50}Thus, the duchy is drawn in the Kingdom of London's orbit of influence, and its new duke is your vassal, which greatly strengthens your position.
{cps=50}Thus, the duchy is drawn in the Kingdom of London's orbit of influence, which greatly strengthens your position.
{cps=50}And your legacy, which you pass on to your descendants and which will be written next to your name in historical treatises, ends up being this kingdom split into three pieces, weakened and mired in petty internal conflicts.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}In an effort to boost your troop numbers, you attract all available mercenary companies and units that exist in this part of the kingdom to your side!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}50,000 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}You've got [kingdom_of_london_prisoners_captured] enemy warriors in captivity...
{cps=50}You decide to execute the captives.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[kingdom_of_london_prisoners_captured] captives executed!{vspace=5}Virtue decreased by 15!
{cps=50}You allow Canterbury to redeem the captives.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[storyroll] florins received!{vspace=5}Canterbury's troop numbers increased by [kingdom_of_london_prisoners_captured]!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}You decide to release the captives without ransom.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Canterbury's troop numbers increased by [kingdom_of_london_prisoners_captured]!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 25!
{cps=50}No one is enthusiastic about this news, since most of the inhabitants of the lands under your control can barely afford to feed themselves...
{cps=50}However, the raised sum still leaves a lot to be desired.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[storyroll] florins received!
{cps=50}Your extreme unpopularity among the lower class, along with the attempt to take away the last of the people's belongings to fund a war they do not need, causes widespread discontent, and peasant uprisings are breaking out all over the Kingdom of London.
{cps=50}The tax collection campaign completely fails, so instead of replenishing the treasury, you now have to spend precious resources on suppressing riots.
{cps=50}Members of the upper class, with whom you are not on the best terms, also mostly ignore your levy or evade it with the excuse of not having any income.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Popularity (nobles) check failed!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}5000 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}In addition, a certain number of wandering knights, as well as noblemen with their own small squads, also answer your call.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige check passed!{vspace=5}The number of troops has been increased by [storyroll]!
{cps=50}With the count dead and his army destroyed, there can be no further armed resistance. One by one, the rebellious lords who were on Canterbury's side either crawl to you on their knees and beg for mercy or hastily abandon their estates and flee - to the north, to the Continent, or to the narrow strip of southern land controlled by Northampton.
{cps=50}After taking possession of the royal relics, you triumphantly return to London, one step closer to becoming a full-fledged ruler of all England.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of this break, Northampton continues to strengthen his positions in the south and also rapidly weaves his web of intrigue, organizing a series of assassination attempts on your inner circle and you personally...
{cps=50}During this forced pause between wars, you receive an unexpected message from Cambridge, in which the duke offers you to hold a private meeting on neutral territory...
{cps=50}You meet in the royal hunting grounds, located about halfway between the capital and the duke's lands. Keeping away from prying ears, you strike up a conversation.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}At this moment, a crossbow bolt hits the trunk of a tree you're both standing near, passing just half an inch from your face.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As you meet the duke's gaze, you both shout at once...
{cps=50}By the time you deal with the assassins with the help of your bodyguards, the duke of Cambridge and his men have already gotten away.
{cps=50}Initially, it is the duke whom you suspect of organizing the assassination attempt. However, as various additional details and circumstances come to light, more and more clues point in the direction of Maidstone.
{cps=50}Either way, regardless of who exactly was behind the attack, an alliance between the Kingdom of London and Cambridge is no longer possible.
{cps=50}Realizing that the impossibility of an alliance means that a military confrontation is unavoidable, you are faced with a choice - where to lead your armies: to the north or to the south?
{cps=50}Northampton once again assists you with making the final decision, as about a week after the hunting incident he once again sends assassins after you, who this time infiltrate your private chambers...
{cps=50}The Duchy of Cambridge remains the only independent fragment of the old kingdom not subject to London. Playing hard to get and waiting for a better opportunity, the duke missed the chance to join either Canterbury or Northampton and ended up alone with you.
{cps=50}If a year or especially two years ago you were quite willing to make serious concessions in order to drag him to your side, now that time has passed.
{cps=50}However, the duke has still got a trump card up his sleeve - an alliance with the Scots, which has fully materialized while you were busy closing the Maidstone question definitively.
{cps=50}After crossing the northern border, which has long remained unprotected by anyone, Scottish troops rush south.
{cps=50}Realizing that they are aiming to join forces with the Duke of Cambridge's troops, you nevertheless decide not to rush in a hurry to defeat them in detail, but on the contrary, spend all available time assembling an army and mobilizing all available resources.
{cps=50}The failed expedition to France and the subsequent protracted internecine war have led to the devastation of many lands of the kingdom and the depletion of the treasury, but, on the other hand, left behind a huge number of veterans - battle-hardened men who had gone through many fights and gained invaluable experience.
{cps=50}The Cambridge and Scottish forces, on the other hand, are far fresher, so most of them don't have even a quarter of such expertise.
{cps=50}With your rich experience in waging wars and personally participating in them, you know well that one experienced soldier, led by a capable commander, could be worth five or even ten recruits. Therefore, having gathered a full army of seasoned veterans, you could well expect to defeat the combined forces of Cambridge and the Scots in a pitched battle.
{cps=50}You are about to test the truth of this belief on a plain between Cambridge and London, where the two armies have met for a general battle.
{cps=50}After arranging your troops according to a disposition conceived in advance, you move forward at the head of your soldiers. As soon as you are spotted on the battlefield, one of the noble Scottish knights immediately directs his squad straight at you...
{cps=50}Northampton demands that you go there immediately and prevent Canterbury's men from taking over the town.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [breakthrough.name!ti].

{cps=50}You spend the following day in the cold and dark of a solitary cell in the basement of one of the surrounding estates, where you have been dumped without food or water.
{cps=50}All your attempts to yell for guards are in vain. And just when you become seriously concerned over the prospect of being simply left to succumb to starvation and dehydration, the cell door finally swings open...{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!{vspace=5}Toxicity level increased!{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 5!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Eva's voice trembles slightly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Eva's quivering voice starts turning steely.
{cps=50}Jingling with his tools, the torture master without a hurry gets down to business...
{cps=50}Over the next few hours you go through a series of absolutely horrific tortures that cripple your body.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}All characteristics decreased by 4!
{cps=50}Growing weary, your tormentor states that it is enough for today and he will be back again tomorrow morning to proceed with his work.
{cps=50}Mauled and bleeding, you are left alone in a cold cell - still without food, but with the clear understanding that you most likely will not last another day like this.
{cps=50}Examination of the cell for possible escape options yields no results, and attempts to call the guards by shouting still end up fruitless.
{cps=50}All that is left for you to do is press down your bleeding wounds with hands, accept your lot, and resignedly await your doom.
{cps=50}After making sure you are [name], he informs you that he has come here on a mission from Earl Northampton, to snatch you from captivity.
{cps=50}Right in front of several guards, who are doing their best to pretend they don't notice anything, the stranger helps you to leave first the cell and then the place where you have been held.
{cps=50}Under the cover of night, you avoid French patrols and reach Cambrai safely.
{cps=50}Despite not knowing how exactly the battle ended, the atmosphere of sadness and confusion reigning inside the walls of Cambrai quickly paints you a very vivid and evident picture.
{cps=50}In the process, they free some captives - including you.
{cps=50}After dealing with several guards, a group of fugitives takes advantage of the cover of night, successfully leaves the place where you have been held, and returns to Cambrai.
{cps=50}Despite not knowing how exactly the battle ended, the atmosphere of sadness and confusion reigning inside the walls of Cambrai quickly paints you a very vivid and evident picture.
{cps=50}Torture, that drains the last bits of life energy out of your body.
{cps=50}On the night of that day, you, completely exhausted by the mutilations, cold, and hunger, fall asleep on the freezing floor of your cell. And never wake up again.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The realization that after getting captured you instantly became unwanted and forgotten wounds your pride as a sharp sting.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}However, had you not failed to kill de Roche, not only would you not be talking to him now, but you'd probably also be on much better terms with Northampton.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}De Roche exits the cell, leaving you alone with your thoughts to face the unknown.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Reflections give you no rest for a while, but eventually fatigue, wounds, and attrition take their toll, and you fall asleep.
{cps=50}You want to protest, but Eva doesn't let you say a word. Her people help you to get out of the cell and then out of the place where you have been held.
{cps=50}Following the instructions you've received from them, you head towards Cambrai, and by dawn you reach the city walls.
{cps=50}Despite not knowing how exactly the battle ended, the atmosphere of sadness and confusion reigning inside the walls of Cambrai quickly paints you a very vivid and evident picture.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}With these words, de Roche turns around and exits the cell without a farewell, leaving you in solitude.
{cps=50}Solitude, which is broken in about an hour by the appearance of two tough guys with an arsenal of torture tools.
{cps=50}After seizing and chaining you to a wall, they without a hurry get down to business...
{cps=50}Over the next few hours you go through a series of absolutely horrific tortures that cripple your body.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}All characteristics decreased by 4!
{cps=50}Growing weary, your tormentors state that it is enough for today and they will be back again tomorrow morning to proceed with their work.

{cps=50}All your attempts to yell for guards are in vain. And just when you become seriously concerned over the prospect of being simply left to succumb to starvation and dehydration, the cell door finally swings open...
{cps=50}After releasing you from imprisonment, de Roche orders his men to accommodate you near his place in the French camp and also to provide you with a meal.
{cps=50}A hot bowl of chowder and a soft plank bed in a warm tent, with which you spend the evening and night, seem more precious to you than any gold after being wounded and captured.
{cps=50}Seeing that one of Eva's men has been wounded, you order him to retreat...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Rounds until an ally retreats: 3
{cps=50}An ally retreats!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}As a token of his appreciation, one of Eva's warriors, who until recently was a stablehand, makes you a gift.
{cps=50}Eva herself, after hearing how perfectly everything went, presents you with a gift as well - a locket with her portrait on it.
{cps=50}A sorrowful Eva holds no grudge against you, recognizing that you did the best you could, yet you still feel guilty.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}When you arrive as ordered, you find de Roche engaged in a hushed conversation with a person you don't know.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}He says the last words while looking straight at you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Now spotted, you step forward and address de Roche.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The tone in which he delivers this makes it clear that if he's going to be at anyone's service, it certainly wouldn't be yours.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After nodding in your direction, Raglan turns back to de Roche.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan raises his eyebrows, chuckles and shrugs.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan pauses as if mid-sentence, and de Roche narrows his eyes questioningly, clearly expecting a continuation.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan throws another quick glance at you and opens his mouth once more, picking his words carefully.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan shrugs his shoulders.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A slight smile on Raglan's face suggests that he's not offended by the joke, even though he doesn't find it particularly funny.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan casts a meaningful glance at you once again.
{cps=50}Over the next week, almost all of which you spend in the saddle, de Roche, conversation after conversation, brings you up to speed on current events.
{cps=50}One of the key reasons that prompted the English king to undertake the expedition to France at exactly this time was the weakness of the French king Jean II along with the precariousness of his position on the throne.
{cps=50}Raised in an atmosphere of constant conspiracies and conflicts, which took the lives of several of his relatives, Jean has got an extremely harsh, cruel, and mistrustful character and has also become very quick to retaliate.
{cps=50}Such behavior has been a source of persistent conflicts with the nobility and has created strong personal animosity between the king and many of his powerful vassals.
{cps=50}With the onset of economic hardship caused by a massive plague epidemic that swept through the kingdom ten years earlier, personal enmity was supplemented by objective reproaches of Jean's inability to halt the kingdom's devastation and the depreciation of the coin value.
{cps=50}The English invasion became the straw that broke the camel's back. The nobility of Normandy - a region traditionally more dependent on maritime trade with England than on river trade on the Seine - refused to contribute troops to Jean's army, rallied around Geoffroy d'Harcourt, who had long held a grudge against the king, and declared a rebellion.
{cps=50}All the while the actual Duke of Normandy, the Dauphin - the king's eldest son and heir, with whom Jean has also got not the warmest relations - for some unknown reason has been in no hurry to take up arms against the rebels, preferring to hole up in Rouen instead.
{cps=50}The reasons for such behavior have been unclear, and figuring them out was none of your business.
{cps=50}Already in the vicinity of Rouen - about a couple hours' ride from the city - you make a brief stop at a village called Oissel to get a respite before the last leg of the journey.
{cps=50}The local chief, however, hastily warns you about a large band of brigands on the route between Oissel and Rouen, that has recently acquired some fine weapons and equipment.
{cps=50}As a result, these scoundrels are now not afraid to attack not only travelers or caravaners, but even knights with small squads of squires. Therefore taking this road is not safe.
{cps=50}Lacking sufficient manpower at hand, de Roche decides not to take any chances, stay in the village for another day or two, and entrust you with clearing the path...
{cps=50}New quest added — Route to Rouen.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Eva breaks into a warm smile.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Eva squints her eyes slyly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Seeing you blush and unable to muster up the words to answer, Eve bursts into melodious laughter.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Eva's face slowly turns from dreamy to serious.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You are too exhausted and can't conduct training!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You spend some time training Eva's men in various aspects of warfare...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quality of training: [new_protector_of_de_lambert_estate.completed!ti]/50{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!{vspace=5}Time lost: 1
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough time left!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You've got nothing to discuss with Eva at the moment.
{cps=50}Emboldened by this victory, some of the allies rush in pursuit of the retreating French. Sensing the opportunity of snatching some valuable loot and captives, who could be ransomed for quite a hefty profit, you consider joining the chase.
{cps=50}You join the chase and soon notice a knight in ornate armor among the retreating troops, who, judging by the way he moves, is seriously wounded and has to lean on an assisting squire's shoulder.
{cps=50}You catch up with them and knock the knight down with a blow from behind, intending to - after quickly disposing of the squire - declare him your prisoner.
{cps=50}However, wariness gets the upper hand, and you decide that you've had enough adventure for the day.
{cps=50}Having received another injury, the knight sinks to the ground and asks for mercy with a hand sign...
{cps=50}However, the squire, whose existence you have forgotten for a second, takes advantage of your oversight and delivers a heavy strike to your head that makes your eyes go dark.
{cps=50}You regain consciousness in French captivity.
{cps=50}However, instead of acknowledging his capture and offering gratitude for keeping him alive, the knight raises the visor of his helmet, spits in your face, and hurls some finest profanities at you.
{cps=50}A less restrained person might have responded to such rude behavior with a mortal strike, but you prove to be more gracious...
{cps=50}And limit yourself to a preventive kick in one of his bleeding wound areas.
{cps=50}Grimacing in pain, the knight is forced to interrupt his stream of obscenities, while you smirk in satisfaction.
{cps=50}This joy, however, proves a little premature, since, distracted by the exchange of pleasantries with the knight, you forget to mind your surroundings.
{cps=50}And so you fail to notice the approach of a few more French soldiers, who resolved to come to the rescue of their comrades.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of your oversight, one of them sneaks up unnoticed and delivers a heavy blow to your head that makes your eyes go dark.
{cps=50}Wisely deciding that a prisoner would be far more trouble than a corpse, you finish off the knight with a sweeping blow.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 20!
{cps=50}You regain consciousness in French captivity.
{cps=50}New quest added — Route to Rouen.
{cps=50}You fail to clear the road in time, yet de Roche, unwilling to delay any longer, gives the order to move out anyway.
{cps=50}You spend some time searching for the brigands plaguing the area between Rouen and Oissel.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}Moving along the route in search of bandits, you, surprisingly, find what you've been looking for, as you wander straight into the thugs' ambush...
{cps=50}As one would expect, about halfway to the city, your squad is ambushed by a large band of brigands.
{cps=50}In the blink of an eye, you are knocked out of the saddle and dealt a few solid blows with a club that knock your breath out.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Intimidated by your ferocity, enemies seemingly start having second thoughts about their decision to mess with you.
{cps=50}Some common guards and servants attempt to block your path several times, but de Roche's searing glare and shout are sufficient to make them get out of the way.
{cps=50}You find the Dauphin and Charles in the main hall at a table set for a meal.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Seeing armed men enter the room after de Roche, the Dauphin tenses up and instantly changes his tone from friendly to irritated.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Dauphin takes a step forward, heading for the exit of the hall, but de Roche blocks his way.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Dauphin opens his mouth to reply, but one of his bodyguards forestalls him and with a shout 'no one dares to threaten the Dauphin!' draws his sword.
{cps=50}Unwilling to prolong the bloodshed, the Dauphin intervenes in the fight...
{cps=50}Once stationed in the duke's residence with his men, de Roche actively engages in organizing the city's defense.
{cps=50}After establishing contact with the bailiff, he discovers that the man has indeed assembled, on Charles' orders, a capable detachment to fight the rebels.
{cps=50}However, due to the epidemic of dysentery that broke out in his camp, he can't yet move towards Rouen...{w}{vspace=5}Also, the combat effectiveness of his detachment is now somewhat undermined...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [health_issues.name!ti].
{cps=50}Shortly after you establish yourselves in Rouen, de Roche, anticipating the possibility of a potential rebel siege of the city, instructs you to go through his equipment and make sure it's in good order and requires no repairs.
{cps=50}Once settled in one of the inner rooms of the ducal chambers, which are now occupied by your boss, you begin to scrutinize the vast arsenal of his armor and weapons.
{cps=50}For a man, who is quite well-off and highly placed in the royal court, De Roche's equipment is spartanly plain: functional and convenient armor with minimal decoration, but with multiple chips, scratches and dents; as well as weighty and unadorned weapons - also with traces of numerous battles.
{cps=50}Having completed your errand and put aside everything that requires repair, you are about to report to de Roche on the work done, when several armed men suddenly burst into his chambers...
{cps=50}Following the order, you inflict several wounds on the last assassin and then knock him down with a powerful punch.
{cps=50}But before you can disarm him, he does something quite unthinkable - he pulls out a dagger and with a yell 'Normandy will be free!' plunges it into his throat.
{cps=50}Just a moment late, de Roche belatedly snatches the dagger away from him and tries to cover the wound with his hands, but the hemorrhage is too intense.
{cps=50}And just a few moments later the assassin draws his last breath.
{cps=50}Unhappy that none of the assassins were taken alive, de Roche nonetheless thanks you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}De Roche raises his eyebrows and looks at you as if you were a complete simpleton.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You've got nothing to discuss with de Roche at the moment.
{cps=50}Following de Roche's instructions, you ask the chief of Oissel about volunteers who would be willing to go in search of the brigands with weapons in their hands.
{cps=50}The chief readily replies that, for a small fee, he will quickly find you the suitable people.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}100 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}Anticipating problems with fixing the equipment, you ask the chief about the whereabouts of the Oissel blacksmith.
{cps=50}The chief, with a cunning squint, replies that it's not hard to find the blacksmith, but he won't be able to do any work - because he recently drank all his tools away at the local tavern.
{cps=50}Therefore, he could show you the way to the workshop, but it would be of little use. Unless, of course, you arrived in Oissel with your own set of blacksmithing tools.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The map has been updated!
{cps=50}You ask the chief where to find a nearby healer.
{cps=50}The chief informs you that the healer lives on a farm on the outskirts of the village and tells you how to reach him.
{cps=50}But then he immediately adds that he personally would not recommend dealing with the healer due to the fact that he charges through the nose for his work, while the quality of this very work often leaves much to be desired.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The map has been updated!
{cps=50}As you visit the healer, he agrees to treat your injuries and wounds should they occur.
{cps=50}As you chat with the healer, you ask him whether he provides any other services - perhaps he could sell alchemical potions or rare ingredients?
{cps=50}The physician tells you that he does indeed have an alchemical laboratory and until very recently he was actively brewing and selling all sorts of concoctions.
{cps=50}However, the laboratory is now in dire need of major repairs, and the chief of Oissel, with whom the healer has a serious conflict, does not let him hire a team of laborers.
{cps=50}As a result, the healer has to repair the laboratory all by himself and in his spare time, which naturally delays the process a lot.
{cps=50}If you could get him a couple or three hard workers without the chief's knowledge, the matter could be finished in no time, after which the preparation and sale of concoctions could be resumed.

{cps=50}After having a chat with the Oissel blacksmith, you get a confirmation of the village chief's words that you heard earlier.
{cps=50}The craftsman has indeed just got out of a two-week bender and now regretfully has to admit that, as a result of his alcoholic marathon, he was left not only without any money, but also without tools, with which he paid for yet another portion of liquor in the local tavern.
{cps=50}In exchange for help in returning the tools, the blacksmith not only promises to provide you with quality and cheap repair of any equipment, but also expresses his willingness to craft various rare weapons at your request.

{cps=50}In order to see the seriousness of the problem for yourself, you personally visit the bailiff's camp to the north of Rouen.
{cps=50}The sight before your eyes proves to be quite depressing - the camp is horribly unsanitary, and a whopping two-thirds of the troops are suffering from dysentery, poisoning, or simply poor health.
{cps=50}Upon inquiring of the bailiff as to what assistance he requires to remedy this distress, you are told that the most urgent need is for potent antidotes and antiseptics.
{cps=50}About a week after your arrival in Rouen, scouts report that the rebel forces, led by Geoffroy d'Harcourt, are finally on the move.
{cps=50}Just as de Roche predicted, after leaving the castle of Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte, Geoffroy's army in a matter of days crosses the vast lands of the duchy in lightning speed and sets camp in the outskirts of Rouen.
{cps=50}During the retreat, however, several squads break away from his army, clearly indicating discord among rebels and the fact that their plans have been very much disrupted.
{cps=50}Emboldened by such a development, de Roche decides not to wait for the arrival of the king and the royal army, but instead gathers all the combat-ready forces and sets off after Geoffroy.
{cps=50}Outnumbered and low on morale, the rebels do not dare to engage in battle and take refuge in the castle of Saint-Sauveur. De Roche, however, wastes no time and immediately sets about storming it.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}After capturing the walls and breaking inside the castle, you notice Geoffroy, who, surrounded by his bodyguards, keeps issuing orders.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}As a result of de Roche's brilliant actions, the rebellion is effectively crushed by the time the royal troops arrive in Normandy. Rouen is completely safe, the rebel leader Geoffroy d'Harcourt is [rebel_leader_fate!ti], most of the rebel lords are defeated, and the few remaining pockets of resistance no longer pose a serious threat.
{cps=50}All that remains for Jean is to leave the rebel remnants be torn apart by his troops, who have been starved for spoils since the indecisive end of the war with the English... And also to promptly seize the property of the aristocrats who have been complicit in the rebellion and reallocate it for the benefit of the depleted royal treasury.
{cps=50}De Roche, who already enjoyed considerable authority among the French lords and soldiers, finally secures the title and fame of the best commander in the kingdom. And considering his recent victory over the English - perhaps in all of Western Europe as well.
{cps=50}While the king's troops finish off the rebel remnants, you, along with the rest of de Roche's men, get a respite and enjoy quiet life in Rouen at the royal court for a couple of weeks.
{cps=50}One day you accompany de Roche on a trip outside the city. As you get far enough from Rouen, you find yourself at some unassuming inn, where, to your surprise, de Roche decides to stop for a couple of mugs of local ale.
{cps=50}Your initial surprise at such a strange choice of leisure activities, which hardly befits your boss's status, quickly fades when you spot Raglan and his bodyguard inside the inn, already waiting for you at a table in a secluded corner.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan sips ale from his mug with a grin.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan's grin grows even wider.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Both Raglan and de Roche go silent and stare into each other's eyes for quite a while.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Seeing that his interlocutor is not going to answer the question, Raglan sighs softly and changes the subject.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Taking a large sip from his mug, De Roche looks around and briefly fixes his gaze on the innkeeper's wife, who helps serving drinks to the guests.
{cps=50}Having defeated the English and crushed the rebellion in Normandy, the king triumphantly returns to Paris.
{cps=50}De Roche - as the architect of both victories - is rewarded with a number of rich land holdings. And you, in turn, receive the rare honor of being knighted by the king himself.
{cps=50}You are granted no lands or castles, yet you are generously rewarded with gold.
{cps=50}Despite the ostensible triumph of the king's homecoming to Paris and the lavish ceremonies honoring the heroes, the real state of affairs in the kingdom appears to be far from good.
{cps=50}From your conversations with de Roche, as well as from the rumors and scraps of conversations that reach your ears, you learn that entire regions of the kingdom have been plunged into lawlessness and chaos due to the rampages of the routiers - the now unemployed mercenaries of the English and French kings, who have turned into well-armed brigands with combat experience after the end of the war.
{cps=50}Their brazenness and impunity have turned out so great that some gangs have not hesitated to operate even in the vicinity of Paris itself.
{cps=50}It hasn't been quite clear as to how exactly fight them, since the army that the king had assembled for the war against the English had to be disbanded upon his return from Normandy - due to the lack of money for its upkeep, as well as the desire of the nobles to return to their lands as soon as possible to prevent them from being plundered.
{cps=50}And none of the aristocrats have been in a hurry to help Jean in solving of the kingdom-wide problems.
{cps=50}The peasants and merchants, who were already dissatisfied with the king for imposing new taxes on them during the war and who are now also suffering from brigands, have been cursing Jean from the bottom of their hearts.
{cps=50}The only thing that has at least somewhat salvaged the situation is a brilliant and brutal quelling of the rebellion in Normandy, which has clearly demonstrated to all those discontent with the king - what exactly awaits them in case of any serious action against the crown...
{cps=50}You have been knighted and stationed at the de Roche estate in Paris.

{cps=50}Betting on the assumption that the monolithic walls of Rouen's fortifications will not be able to compensate for the small number of the city's defenders, Geoffroy decides to launch an assault.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}You have no trouble repelling the rebel attack on your section of the wall, but your military prowess proves insufficient to overcome the enemy's large numerical advantage.
{cps=50}In many other areas of the assault, which are either protected poorly or not protected at all due to the small number of Rouen's defenders, Geoffroy d'Harcourt's troops achieve success, and soon the fate of the city is sealed.
{cps=50}De Roche and some of his men manage to escape Rouen and retreat towards Jean's troops.
{cps=50}Upon receiving the grim news of the rebels' capture of the capital of Normandy and the actual loss of the entire duchy, the king flies into a rage.
{cps=50}De Roche gets severely criticized and, despite his extensive experience, status, and many years of faithful service, removed from command of the troops.
{cps=50}You, however, are treated even more harshly. Accused by royal officials of cowardice and of voluntary surrender of Rouen to the rebels, you, along with the few other surviving defenders of the city, end up under arrest.
{cps=50}But fate decrees otherwise.
{cps=50}Having defeated the English and crushed the rebellion in Normandy, the king triumphantly returns to Paris.
{cps=50}De Roche - as the architect of both victories - is rewarded with a number of rich land holdings. And you, in turn, receive the rare honor of being knighted by the king himself.

{cps=50}Among other perks, you also manage to obtain your own chest to store your gear and loot.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Chest obtained!
{cps=50}...and he doesn't intend to wait any longer.
{cps=50}You have no choice but to obey and report to him immediately.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raising his goblet of wine in the direction of Charles of Navarre, who is sitting nearby, the king continues...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}With these words Jean drains the goblet to the approving roar of everyone gathered and pours himself some more wine.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The king turns to de Roche.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Out of the corner of your eye, you notice de Roche locking eyes with Raglan, with the privy counsellor nodding approvingly at your boss.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As the king continues toasting, he thanks a whole list of other people - starting with his bravest knights who have distinguished themselves in battle and ending with the 'hard-working French Jacques' who have been supplying food for the king's table.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}When this extended series of toasts finally comes to a close, you once again notice how Raglan, who ended up being almost the only person at the table that Jean didn't mention, exchanges glances with de Roche and throws up his hands in caricatured chagrin.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your name is also not mentioned by the king... But you didn't count on that anyway.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Once done with the toasts, the king starts the meal, inviting all the guests to follow his example. The knights, seated at the far end of the table, quietly strike up their own conversations, while the liege lords, seated next to the king, discuss matters of state.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Trying not to make your curiosity obvious, you nevertheless listen carefully, struggling to catch every word...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The king takes a pause to finish a piece of a leg of mutton.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The king drains another goblet of wine with a chuckle.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Charles responds with a smile.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Charles casts his eyes around the liege lords sitting near him.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Charles nods in de Roche's direction.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan, whose face immediately assumes a concerned expression, leans over to Jean's ear and starts whispering something, but the king stops him with a gesture.
{cps=50}At the end of the feast, all the distinguished knights who were present at the table are given small gifts from the king. Thanks to your extremely presentable appearance, you are also among the recipients.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige check passed!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}1000 florins received!
{cps=50}The Dauphin is being held under guard in the dungeons of the Conciergerie...
{cps=50}Bribe the guards with 300 florins?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}300 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A figure materializes out of the cell's impenetrable darkness and slowly approaches the door.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Dauphin sneers.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Dauphin loudly exhales.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The conversation clearly took a turn that you weren't expecting.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You attempt to continue the conversation, but the Dauphin is no longer interested in talking to you.
{cps=50}You have no choice but to return empty-handed.
{cps=50}As you turn to walk back, you are suddenly called out by someone from one of the cells adjacent to the dauphin's.
{cps=50}The unknown inmate clearly wishes to speak with you, but it may be dangerous to linger in this place...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}EXP for completing the quest: +[temp_experience_number]
{cps=50}You're visiting the trade district of Paris...
{cps=50}Charles of Navarre keeps his promise and indeed, literally within a week, fields a fairly large and relatively well-armed detachment. After merging with de Roche's men, as well as a number of royal knights, the result is a very impressive force.
{cps=50}Only later, as it often happens, it turns out that the warriors sent by Charles are, for the most part, militiamen and peasants pulled from who knows where - with minimal experience with weapons, and in some cases no experience at all.
{cps=50}However, at this stage it is too late to revise the plans and de Roche has to work with what he got.
{cps=50}The main task assigned to him by the king is regaining control of the city of Rennes - the capital of Brittany - which has been seized by routier detachments as well as local rebels from among the landowners who rebelled against the Duke de Montfort.
{cps=50}Expecting to face another siege, you mentally prepare yourself to spend an indefinite period of time in a tent camp again... But de Roche has other plans in mind.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of the large port of Rennes, which, after the city had been seized by the routiers, was virtually unprotected due to the partial power vacuum, de Roche decides to attack the city from the sea.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Shocked by your onslaught, the mercenaries abandon the harbor and retreat deeper into the city...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Retreating from the city streets, the routiers take refuge in the ducal residence...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}The routiers fail to hold the ducal residence all the same, and, shortly after you break through their last line of defense, the mercenaries lose their will to resist and begin to surrender.
{cps=50}By the evening of the same day, the city and its environs are under your complete control. Instead of a lengthy siege that could take weeks or months, the operation to capture Rennes takes just a few hours.
{cps=50}Having put the city under temporary management of the Breton bailiff and left some of his men to maintain order and reorganize the city's militia, de Roche and his men set off back to Paris.
{cps=50}The return trip goes well, although not without some adventures - several times you come across small bands of routiers and brigands terrorizing the lands between Brittany and Paris, but in all instances the bandits are quickly defeated.
{cps=50}The peasants and townsfolk, grateful for their deliverance from the brigands, warmly welcome you, eagerly share their supplies, and quite generously give you their gratitude and blessings. Many of them are already familiar with the name of Guillaume de Roche, so meeting him in person, especially under such circumstances, only further strengthens his reputation as a folk hero.
{cps=50}Raising mugs of beer and ale to his health, however, all of them often mention the king right after - whom they wish to either go to the next world or abdicate in favor of someone more competent... Someone like de Roche, for instance.
{cps=50}De Roche reacts to such talk with indignation, thus respecting the chain of command and demonstrating his loyalty to the oath of allegiance he gave to the king. However, even your not so perceptive eyes invariably catch some hints of assent and solidarity with such sentiments behind his ostentatious resentment.
{cps=50}And so, moving from town to town and from village to village, you soon reach Versailles - a small settlement near Paris.
{cps=50}Questioning the Versailles burgomaster about the situation in Paris does not clarify the picture much: he reports that just the other day a rumor spread across the capital that the Dauphin, who had been imprisoned in Conciergerie on charges of treason, had escaped from custody. The capital's traders, led by the provost of the merchants Étienne Marcel, had apparently been awaiting this development - since shortly thereafter they announced a revolt against the king.
{cps=50}Their armed groups took control of the city, forcing Jean to take shelter in his fortified residence, which ended up being effectively besieged.
{cps=50}Meanwhile, Charles of Navarre, who was also at his Parisian estate at the time of the insurrection, was rumored to have begun gathering troops to rescue the king and blocked all entry and exit points of the city to cut the rebel supply lines as well as to prevent the rebellion from spreading to the surrounding areas.
{cps=50}As to how exactly the Dauphin managed to escape, where he was now, and whether he was connected with the rebels - nobody knew.
{cps=50}Despite the overall fatigue after another day's travel, de Roche decides to waste no time on rest and rush to Paris to the king's rescue.
{cps=50}Assuming that before him the men of Charles of Navarre, an ally of the king, De Roche demands to let him and his men into Paris, but the captain in charge of the outpost, who unexpectedly turned out to be an Englishman, responds with a terse refusal.
{cps=50}The darkness, the uncertainty, and the utter exhaustion of his men by the long journey cause de Roche to be cautious, and, instead of trying to break through the outpost by force, he decides to stop for the night at the nearby abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés...
{cps=50}First transported by carriage, then by ship, and then once more by carriage - all this lasts for so long that you manage to lose count of the days again.
{cps=50}And, once your blindfold is finally removed, you find yourself in a small fortress lost in the middle of mountain ranges in an unknown land.
{cps=50}You are once again put in a cell, and this time, apparently, for good.
{cps=50}After carefully inspecting the new place of your confinement, you notice that the back wall of the cell is seriously dilapidated and could collapse from heavy impact.
{cps=50}Despite the burning desire to try to get out immediately, you decide to proceed cautiously, take advantage of the fact that your cell now has a massive grate instead of a solid door, and spend the next few days waiting and studying your situation.
{cps=50}Among the observations you make, the main ones are the small number of jailers and their carelessness - the low-rank guards spend their time sleeping and drinking, and no one from the command checks on them.
{cps=50}On one hand, these observations give you confidence that escape is feasible...
{cps=50}On the other hand, however, the mountainous scenery you saw upon your arrival here suggests that you are somewhere in the far reaches of the kingdom. So even in case of a successful breakout, you risk ending up in some impenetrable wilderness that would be impossible to get out of.
{cps=50}Putting aside unpleasant thoughts, you reason that the most logical thing to do would be to deal with problems as they come up - which means you should focus on escaping first.
{cps=50}Having waited for an appropriate moment, you attempt to press the wall out as quietly as possible.
{cps=50}But no matter how hard you try, you don't succeed.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Strength check failed!
{cps=50}Out of desperation you lose your cool and make too much noise, which alerts the guards, who immediately transfer you to another cell.
{cps=50}The cell in which you spend the rest of your life.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 23 of 19.
{cps=50}And you succeed. One by one, the stones give in to your pressure and fall out, opening a passage into a niche between the walls, from which you move into the sewers and then to the floor below.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Strength check passed!
{cps=50}At this point, luck turns away from you for a moment, and you get spotted by one of the guards. But luckily for you, he is dead drunk, so his attempts to stop you appear to be extremely feeble.
{cps=50}You arm yourself with a nearby chair and prepare to fight back.
{cps=50}The noise of the prolonged fight draws the attention of a few more guards.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Having dealt with the enemies and taken their equipment, you get to the inner courtyard, where you come literally face to face with another group of guards, among whom are crossbowmen.
{cps=50}After killing or putting to flight everyone who stood in your way, you finally break free.
{cps=50}Ahead lay the snowy and steep mountains of a completely unknown part of the kingdom, numerous dangers, and the uncertainty.
{cps=50}No one knew where you had gone or whether you had reached your goal. All that was known was that the story of a knight named [name], a warrior in the service of the French king and a bodyguard of Guillaume de Roche, ended here and he was never heard of again.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 23 of 19.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You find your boss in the study of his Parisian estate. Pensively gazing into the dancing flame in the fireplace, de Roche does not immediately notice your arrival.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [high_society.name!ti].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The tone, in which he utters the last phrase, clearly betrays the fatigue of a man who, just during your short acquaintance, has thrice pulled the king out of the worst scrapes, literally embarking on another military campaign right after the previous one.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [longest_night.name!ti].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Despite the sharp response, you notice a subtle smirk on De Roche's lips and a gleam in his eyes.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You've got nothing to discuss with de Roche at the moment.
{cps=50}After familiarizing yourself with the volunteers whom the chief suggests to you and ending up not particularly impressed with them, you wonder whether he has any more serious warriors in mind.
{cps=50}After scratching his head, the chief says that there are indeed two veterans living in Oissel - Bernard, an impoverished knight, and Pascal, a former sergeant in the royal army and an old soldier. Both took part in some serious campaigns a dozen years ago, but have long since lived a civilian life. So it's hard to say whether they'll be attracted by your offer...
{cps=50}Both, according to the chief, frequent the Oissel tavern.
{cps=50}Besides them, there is also one of the local hunters in the woods behind the village, Adam, who got famous last year after single-handedly tracking down and killing two brigands that robbed one of Oissel's shops.
{cps=50}Perhaps you should reach out to one of them, the chief concludes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item received: [oissel_blacksmith_order_name!ti]!

{cps=50}You check out the Oissel tavern...
{cps=50}You find a knight named Bernard in the Oissel tavern and offer him to join your squad for a fee.
{cps=50}After scrutinizing your clothes and equipment with a haughty look, which clearly doesn't quite match his own, to put it mildly, lackluster appearance, Bernard squints his eyes...

{cps=50}You find an old soldier named Pascal in the Oissel tavern and offer him to join your squad for a good pay.
{cps=50}Pascal, who has just been telling his drinking buddies some story from his military past, sighs sadly and says that he would love to swing a sword again - especially for good money, but the times of his youthful prowess are long gone.
{cps=50}Now he's a veteran, battered by chronic illnesses and unhealed wounds. So he is hardly fit for service.
{cps=50}Pascal recounts an impressive list of his illnesses and injuries and then asks you to get him some good medicine, as well as a hefty dose of painkillers (in the form of alcohol).{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [second_youth.name!ti].

{cps=50}After getting everything he wanted and improving his health, Pascal becomes so cheerful and grateful to you that he even agrees to join the squad for a very symbolic sum - just to recollect his youth as soon as possible.
{cps=50}After pondering the idea a bit, the hunter admits that things have not been going well for him lately due to the bandits scaring away the forest game.
{cps=50}Therefore, an opportunity to earn some money and, at the same time, restore the former tranquility to the Oissel forests attracts him greatly.
{cps=50}However, he is quick to point out that he is a hunter, not a soldier, and thus he would feel extremely vulnerable in battle without a large shield, behind which he could safely hide while reloading his crossbow.
{cps=50}And he's not going to take a huge risk by going into battle without a shield, since he has got a family after all...
{cps=50}In other words, if you get him a large shield like pavise, he will readily join you. Otherwise, he will have to decline.{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [hunter_turned_soldier.name!ti].

{cps=50}Once you enter the dungeons of the Conciergerie, you find yourself in a labyrinth of corridors and locked cells with massive wooden doors.
{cps=50}After sneaking to the guard post and snatching a piece of parchment listing the names of the prisoners and the numbers of the cells in which they are being held, you begin your search for the Dauphin.
{cps=50}After about a quarter of an hour of wandering through the corridors, shrouded in gloom, you finally find the door behind which the Dauphin is supposed to be. Peering into the darkness of the unlit cell through a barred hole, you quietly call...
{cps=50}Trying not to make too much noise, you start heading in the opposite direction...
{cps=50}But suddenly, you are called out by someone from one of the cells adjacent to the dauphin's.
{cps=50}You agree to hear him out.
{cps=50}The inmate introduces himself as Bertrand Bourguignon and claims to be the younger brother of Guy Bourguignon, a captain of a large squad of routiers prowling the outskirts of Paris.
{cps=50}Bertrand asks you for a small favor - to simply visit one of the taverns on the outskirts of the city and quietly tell the owner of the establishment which wing of the castle and which cell he is kept in.
{cps=50}Everything else, including the payment of a very substantial reward, will be handled by his brother.
{cps=50}You don't waste your precious time on him and hastily get out of the Conciergerie.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}EXP for completing the quest: +[temp_experience_number]
{cps=50}You find the tavern mentioned by the inmate and, after ordering a pint of ale from its owner, furtively whisper to him that you have information about Bertrand Bourguignon.
{cps=50}The tavern keeper listens to you attentively, thanks you and suggests that you visit his place in a couple or three days.
{cps=50}Just the very next day, you hear rumors of a daring escape of a group of routiers from the royal prison.
{cps=50}Eager to get your reward, you visit the tavern again. However, you do not receive any money from the tavern owner. Instead, he states that Guy Bourguignon wishes to meet you in person and suggests that you visit him in the Boulogne Forest.
{cps=50}In response to your question as to how exactly you are supposed to find one person in a huge forest area, he advises you not to worry, since you are 'invited' and your visit will be awaited.
{cps=50}After about a quarter of an hour of searching, you ride deep into the thicket, yet still find no sign of a routier camp, which starts irritating you.
{cps=50}But just when you are about to give up the search, you are suddenly surrounded by armed men who appeared literally out of nowhere.
{cps=50}Having clarified your identity and the purpose of your forest trip, they escort you deeper into the thicket along some winding paths. Soon enough you reach a large and disorderly tent camp, reminiscent of a fairground and a military camp at the same time.
{cps=50}Right afterwards, you meet with Guy Bourguignon, who thanks you for your assistance in rescuing his brother and, as a reward, offers you a choice of either 3,000 florins...{vspace=5}{w}Or his gratitude and willingness to one day, possibly, return the favor.
{cps=50}After paying you the promised sum, Guy Bourguignon bids you farewell.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}3,000 florins received.
{cps=50}The routier commander shakes your hand and promises that one day he will come to your aid just as you have come to his.
{cps=50}You visit the Boulogne routier camp...
{cps=50}You return to the city...
{cps=50}The bridge over the Seine leading into the city is guarded by a group of armed soldiers under the command of a captain, who flatly refuses to allow anyone - especially armed people - passage into the capital.
{cps=50}You hint to the captain that you are willing to offer him a good remuneration if he forgets his orders for a few minutes.
{cps=50}Chuckling, he replies that he doesn't need any problems with the command, so he won't let an armed man through even for a million florins - there's no telling what one might do once in the city.
{cps=50}An unarmed person, on the other hand, should be less prone to causing trouble. Supposedly...
{cps=50}So, if you come unarmed and offer him an attractive sum, you will meet the dawn in Paris.
{cps=50}The sum that would be attractive enough for him amounts to [bridge_checkpoint_bribe!i] florins.
{cps=50}Crossing the river by swimming seems like a feasible task...
{cps=50}But only provided that you bring only the most necessary stuff and get rid of everything unnecessary and cumbersome.{vspace=5}And that you are not afraid of hypothermia and health consequences.

{cps=50}Engulfed by the uprising, Paris is not a pretty sight: groups of armed peasants roam the streets and ransack houses of affluent citizens, bloody clashes between opposing groups break out here and there, and fires rage in several parts of the capital.
{cps=50}After completing all of de Roche's errands and scouting the situation in the city, you are free to return back to the abbey.
{cps=50}You decide to head towards the royal castle...
{cps=50}The residence of Charles of Navarre is located behind the Vincennes Forest in a completely different part of the city. It would be very logical to visit Cité and study the situation around the royal castle before heading there...
{cps=50}You decide to head towards the residence of Charles of Navarre...
{cps=50}You decide to head towards the Boulogne Forest...
{cps=50}At one point, as you carefully navigate the city streets, you run into several armed men - apparently rebels.
{cps=50}They threaten you with weapons and demand you empty your pockets and give them everything of value if you want to keep your life.
{cps=50}Unwilling to get into a fight with armed men without proper equipment, you decide to comply and empty your pockets.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[player_gold!i] florins lost!
{cps=50}Once they got what they wanted, the extortionists let you go.
{cps=50}You have no intention to empty your pockets for a group of petty thugs, so instead you prepare to defend yourself...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have got no weapon!
{cps=50}Without a second's hesitation you rush away in the winding narrow streets and alleys and manage to get away from the pursuers.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: [paris_riots_time_loss!i]!{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}You notice a gang of marauders looting someone's shop on one of the city streets...

{cps=50}You decide to confront the robbers and draw your weapon.
{cps=50}As you navigate the city streets, you witness an armed clash between a small group of city guards and a large squad of rebels...
{cps=50}You draw your weapon and engage in the fight on the side of the guards.
{cps=50}As you navigate through the city, you stumble upon one of the Parisian churches.
{cps=50}It is left completely unscathed and now looks like an island of serenity and safety against the background of looted shops and houses burning all over the capital.
{cps=50}As you approach, one of the church ministers notices you and waves, signaling that here you can take shelter.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check passed!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level decreased!
{cps=50}As you move through the city streets, you come across a seriously injured man, apparently one of the soldiers of the city guard who got wounded in a confrontation with rebels or bandits.
{cps=50}Bleeding out, he asks for your help...
{cps=50}You assist him in dressing his wounds and stopping the bleeding.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: 1.{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}He thanks you for the aid and tells you that he by some miracle escaped from the barracks of the city guard, which have been captured by the rebels.
{cps=50}The rebels now have access to arms, and a substantial part of the soldiers who were supposed to maintain order in Paris have been captured.
{cps=50}Clearly having no trust in you, the soldier refuses.
{cps=50}And then almost immediately stops breathing.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 30!
{cps=50}After pushing you away, the soldier stabs you with his sword and forces you to flee.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Health decreased by 20!{vspace=5}Bleeding!
{cps=50}As you move along one of the city streets, you come across a barricade built by rebels that blocks the way.
{cps=50}Fortunately, it is protected by just a couple of bored militiamen, who, judging from their appearance, are neither observant nor in high fighting spirit.
{cps=50}On one of the long and narrow city streets you suddenly cross paths with a huge furious mob moving towards the center of Paris.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of the alley's narrowness which doesn't allow anyone to easily get behind you, you give battle to the crowd.
{cps=50}Realizing that facing a bloodthirsty mob would be suicide, while running away would mean wasting a lot of time, you look for an opportunity to hide...
{cps=50}You wait out the danger and continue on your way.
{cps=50}As a result, you have no choice but to flee.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: [paris_riots_time_loss!i]!{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}Intimidated by your ferocity, bandits seemingly start having second thoughts about their decision to mess with you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: 1.
{cps=50}As you explore the city streets, you come across a ransacked tavern...
{cps=50}As you explore the city streets, you come across a corpse of a slain knight...
{cps=50}As you explore the city streets, you come across half a dozen bloodied bodies lying right on the sidewalk - the aftermath of a bloody skirmish between rebels and city guards.
{cps=50}Most of the valuables and pieces of gear have already been stripped from the dead, but there may be something interesting still left...
{cps=50}As you explore the city streets, you come across a looted house...
{cps=50}As you explore the city streets, you come across a looted apothecary's store...
{cps=50}As you explore the city streets, you come across a looted blacksmith workshop...
{cps=50}As you explore the city streets, you come across a looted leather workshop...
{cps=50}As you explore the city streets, you come across a looted fletcher's workshop...
{cps=50}As you explore the city streets, you come across a looted weapons store...
{cps=50}You explore the Parisian streets in search of weapons and equipment, but find nothing...
{cps=50}Trying to be cautious so as not to stumble upon anything else, you carefully make your way to Cité to assess the situation around the royal residence with your own eyes.
{cps=50}The fears are confirmed - the king's castle is indeed blocked by a whole army of rebels, which de Roche's small detachment will certainly not be able to overcome.
{cps=50}You're going to need allies in order to save the king.
{cps=50}Avoiding dangerous encounters, you slowly but surely make your way through the chaos-ridden city and, after passing through the Vincennes Forest, find yourself near the residence of Charles of Navarre.
{cps=50}Judging by the scene that you observe, the residence of the King of Navarre has also faced an invasion of uninvited guests...
{cps=50}However, if the royal castle in the center of the city was getting stormed by a whole enraged mob, then Charles, judging by the number of corpses, got visited by a dozen brigands at most, whom his numerous guards quickly sent to the afterlife.
{cps=50}After reporting that you are a messenger from Guillaume de Roche, you are let inside and are soon brought before Charles himself.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Charles narrows his eyes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The words spoken by Charles are so unexpected that you are left speechless. De Roche, judging by his raised eyebrows, is also seriously surprised.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}De Roche raises his eyebrows questioningly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Clearly not expecting to hear that, Charles starts losing patience.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After a long pause, de Roche diplomatically spreads his hands and chuckles.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Once back at the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, you report on the results of your reconnaissance mission.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}De Roche, as expected, decides to move out to join up with Charles so that they could then march to the king's rescue with combined forces.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}De Roche takes a long pause.
{cps=50}After securing a meeting with Guy Bourguignon, you tell him about the current situation and also remind him that he is in your debt.
{cps=50}Contrary to what one might expect, the mercenary turns out to be a man of honour (at least in this matter) and does not renege on his earlier promise.
{cps=50}However, as he reasonably points out, passing on a message from prison and quelling an uprising in a huge city are slightly unequal things.
{cps=50}Gratitude is gratitude, but nobody would undertake such a job for free. Taking your friendship into account, he is willing to make a good discount, but the final price would still be substantial.
{cps=50}Guy Bourguignon and his squad are ready to join you for 5,000 florins.
{cps=50}Guy Bourguignon agrees to take your side and marches with his men to the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}5,000 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}Upon reaching the city guard barracks, you see that the building has indeed been overrun by rebels and turned into a prison, where the captive guards are being held, as well as the king's supporters who have been captured on the streets.
{cps=50}There is no chance to fully retake the barracks from the rebels - their numerical advantage is too great. However, you should be able to quickly break in, free some prisoners, and then escape.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}You are unable to quickly deal with the barracks guards and, when the enemy reinforcements start arriving, you are forced to flee...
{cps=50}Having failed to obtain comprehensive information about the ongoing developments in the city, you share what scarce information you managed to gather with de Roche...
{cps=50}He, as expected, decides to move out to join up with Charles so that they could then march to the king's rescue with combined forces.
{cps=50}You have to force your way across the bridge...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Shocked by your onslaught, the enemies decide to retreat...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}Seeing that the battle is not going in their favor, the enemies retreat...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}After safely reaching Charles' residence, you appear before the King of Navarre.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The words spoken by Charles are so unexpected that you are left speechless. De Roche, judging by his raised eyebrows, is also seriously surprised.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}De Roche raises his eyebrows questioningly
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Clearly not expecting to hear that, Charles starts losing patience.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After a long pause, de Roche diplomatically spreads his hands and chuckles.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}One by one, most of De Roche's men are slain, while he himself gets wounded, disarmed and subdued. Standing alone, you attempt to resist for a while, but your enemies encircle you, and you meet the same fate as your chief.
{cps=50}Given the lack of natural light, you struggle to keep track of the days spent in detention, and around the second week you lose count.
{cps=50}A meagre diet and the constant cold of the cell take a toll on your health.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}All characteristics decreased by 3!{vspace=5}Toxicity level increased!
{cps=50}Growing increasingly despondent about your chances of ever getting out of here alive, you slowly begin to lose hope and the will to live.
{cps=50}Having spent an unknown amount of time in the dungeons of Charles of Navarre's residence.
{cps=50}However, you don't get to bid farewell to life in the dungeons of Charles of Navarre's residence, and, after a while, you get a sack pulled over your head, then dragged out of your cell and taken to an unknown destination.
{cps=50}The castle's narrow stairways and corridors make it impossible for them to simply swarm you, negating the enemy's only advantage.
{cps=50}Seeing that the plan is falling apart and his own castle is about to be taken over by the enemy, Charles with his assistant and one of the bodyguards hurriedly try to escape.
{cps=50}You are not about to let them get away, however.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The person next to Charles, whom you have mistaken for his assistant, throws off his hood.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}De Roche narrows his eyes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The earl grins crookedly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Northampton gives a phlegmatic sigh.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}De Roche's smirk grows wider.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Northampton dramatically looks up both of his sleeves and then spreads his hands.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}De Roche and Northampton shake hands.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Looking around de Roche's knights, Northampton meets your gaze.
{cps=50}After arresting Charles and transferring command of some of his forces that were blocking all entry and exit points of Paris to himself on behalf of the king, de Roche relieves the siege of the royal castle.
{cps=50}Essentially, a grand battle, where the rebels would be soundly defeated, never occurs.
{cps=50}On his way from Charles' residence, de Roche routs several small rebel squads. And, by the time he reaches Cité, panic breaks out among Étienne Marcel's men - who were ready to fight the few city guards and pillage, not confront the knights and mercenaries - and spreads like wildfire, resulting in a stampede.
{cps=50}A few of the rebels who fail to flee in time are slaughtered by [storyroll!ti], who are in the vanguard of de Roche's forces and are the first to reach Cité.
{cps=50}Meanwhile, Étienne Marcel himself is promptly handed over to de Roche by his own former supporters, who are now looking for an opportunity to reconcile with the king and avoid punishment for their participation in a rebellion that started out so well, yet got crushed so swiftly.
{cps=50}Thus, this crisis that has engulfed the capital and nearly changed the fate of the entire kingdom comes to an end.
{cps=50}The status and political weight of Charles of Navarre, who nominally holds a title identical to that of the French king, prevent Jean from executing him or simply keeping him imprisoned indefinitely.
{cps=50}Instead, on Raglan's advice, the king strikes a deal with him, sparing his life in exchange for giving up most of his possessions beyond Navarre as well as his claim to the French throne.
{cps=50}And also in return for a promise to marry his only daughter to the Dauphin, thus making him heir to the title of King of Navarre.
{cps=50}Not particularly thrilled with this arrangement, Charles, after losing all of his allies and a substantial number of his men, is however compelled to go along with it.
{cps=50}On the urgent advice of De Roche, who has finally secured the informal title of Warden of France for himself, the king acquits the Dauphin, who has recently been released from Charles' captivity, of charges of treason and conspiracy, restoring his position at court.
{cps=50}However, due to Jean's mistrust and the Dauphin's bitterness, a full-fledged reconciliation between father and son cannot be reached.
{cps=50}Realizing the danger of the situation, in which the current and future kings of France almost openly detest each other, Raglan offers an elegant solution to the problem...
{cps=50}After receiving the title of King of Navarre and large land holdings as a gift for his wedding to Charles' daughter, the Dauphin would have to renounce the title of heir to the French throne in favor of his younger brother and settle for the throne of Navarre.
{cps=50}After securing the consent of the young prince, who is willing to relinquish the French crown in exchange for freedom from his father's influence and from the necessity of dealing with him, Raglan extinguishes the fires of discord within the royal house.
{cps=50}Such change of status did not cure their violent temper, however, so they simply continued plundering and murdering, but now in broad daylight and in densely populated Parisian quarters.
{cps=50}Jean, who now saw treason and treachery everywhere, was in no hurry to deal with them, counting on the possibility of turning to them for protection in case of another uprising.
{cps=50}However, even he quickly realized that if the routiers were allowed to stay in the city much longer, the people would either grab their pitchforks again or simply start scattering out of the capital.
{cps=50}If earlier it was mostly travelers, peasants and traders who suffered from the brigands, now robberies and murders started reaching the densely populated Parisian quarters.
{cps=50}De Roche found a way out of this situation and suggested to pay wages to the mercenaries - through the sales of various properties and lands confiscated from Charles - and then send them to Navarre to fight in the war against Castile.
{cps=50}Jean's low-intensity conflict with the Castilian King Pedro had been going on for several years, ever since Pedro first imprisoned and then ordered the execution of Blanca of Bourbon - his wife and the French king's cousin.
{cps=50}John repeatedly started gathering troops for the Castilian campaign, but each time something thwarted the implementation of those plans.
{cps=50}The last such hindrance was the landing of the English at Dunkirk, which first provoked a prolonged confrontation around Cambrai, and then a protracted crisis throughout the entire kingdom.
{cps=50}Now there were no more hindrances, so it was time for Pedro to pay for his atrocities. The king yet again called upon de Roche and entrusted him with accompanying the Dauphin on his journey to Navarre, as well as leading the subsequent Castilian campaign.
{cps=50}A few days before his departure, de Roche meets Raglan in the Vincennes Forest - as usual, away from prying eyes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan sighs and gazes up into the sky.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan purses his lips.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}De Roche replies with visible irritation.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan smiles.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After exchanging a long look with de Roche, Raglan nods.
{cps=50}Having weighed all of the possible options, de Roche decides to attack Burgos, the capital of Castile. In this way, he would either make Pedro accept battle in unfavorable circumstances - without having received reinforcements from all of his allies...
{cps=50}Or force him to retreat to the south and effectively cede the entire north of the kingdom to de Roche and Henry of Trastámara.
{cps=50}After completing your preparations, you leave Pamplona and march westward.
{cps=50}The road to the Castilian capital has been turned into real scorched earth by Pedro's men - nearby villages have been abandoned and burned, bridges over rivers and ravines destroyed, forest wildlife scared away, wells poisoned.
{cps=50}All of this negatively affects both the pace of movement and the physical condition of the warriors.
{cps=50}The second problem that appears soon after crossing the borders of Castile is the light squads of the Moors, who constantly harass de Roche's forces with brief attacks.
{cps=50}One such attack is directed against the vanguard of the army, where your squad happens to be...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}After giving you a thrashing with their attack, the Moors retreat...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}As a result, instead of the limited forces Pedro earlier had at his disposal, it is an impressively sized army including English, Granadian and Portuguese detachments that meets you under the walls of Burgos.
{cps=50}With no room for maneuver, it is now de Roche who finds himself forced to give Pedro a fight on unfavorable terms...
{cps=50}Moreover, the Castilian king's army appears scattered between several camps at the time of the routiers' arrival.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of this, de Roche immediately attacks Pedro's troops that have been caught off guard...
{cps=50}The battle is dragging on. Perhaps you should retreat to save your life...
{cps=50}The enemy's onslaught does not weaken, and you start to retreat little by little, giving up positions...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 20!
{cps=50}Exhausted by the long hard march and outnumbered by Pedro's men, the routiers stand firm for a while and even overpower the Castilians in some areas - but their strength is quickly running out.
{cps=50}One after another, de Roche's detachments are defeated and put to flight. The pike squares that he has so carefully organized crumble and turn into a chaotic mob.
{cps=50}Seeing the collapse of the French forces, a group of heavily-armed Castilian knights, at Pedro's orders, strike at the very center of your positions in order to capture de Roche.
{cps=50}Since you are on the other flank, you cannot come to his aid immediately, yet you see how he fights his opponents while surrounded and then receives a swinging blow with an axe to his helmet, which causes him to fall to the ground and disappear from view.
{cps=50}Your military experience is enough to realize that the outcome of this battle is already decided. And even if you were Hector of Troy or Roland himself - nothing could be changed.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check failed!
{cps=50}You make the decision to flee for your life.
{cps=50}The path of retreat, however, has already been blocked by squads of light infantry that have come up behind you...
{cps=50}You make the decision to break through to de Roche's body.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}After putting the captured King Pedro to death, de Roche triumphantly enters Burgos with his troops, where, shortly after, he elevates Henry of Trastámara to the throne.
{cps=50}The Castilian campaign comes to an end.
{cps=50}After breaking through the encirclement and gathering the few mercenaries who have retained some discipline around you, you hastily flee the battlefield.
{cps=50}You cheer up after safely retreating from the walls of the Castilian capital, but this joy quickly proves to be premature.
{cps=50}The way back still lies through the scorched earth, the last meager resources of which were completely depleted by yourselves during the march to Burgos.
{cps=50}Returning back to Navarre by the same road, while being without supplies, as well as pursued by the Granadian and Castilian cavalry along the way, was not an option.
{cps=50}Realizing this, you decide to turn south.
{cps=50}After nabbing a few local peasants and forcing them to serve you as guides, you slip away from Pedro and his allies, vanishing in the forests and hills of central Iberia.
{cps=50}After escaping from the pursuers and completely exhausting all available resources, you reach the city of Soria, where you seek a way to earn a living and get hired as a mercenary by one of the local aristocrats.
{cps=50}In search of a more solid income, you leave Soria and move to Madrid, where you take part in knight tournaments.
{cps=50}Given your tremendous military experience, you easily score victory after victory over many distinguished yet far less experienced opponents and, after a few years, gain fame and fortune.
{cps=50}And along with them comes love, as you start a romance with Leonora - the daughter of Fadrique Alfonso, the powerful Master of the Order of Santiago.
{cps=50}However, after securing your meteoric rise, your adventurous nature soon also becomes the cause of your downfall.
{cps=50}As you acquire money, connections, and influential friends, you once again get involved in big politics and make another attempt to deal with King Pedro. This time by organizing his assassination during his visit to Madrid.
{cps=50}The plan fails due to the betrayal of one of the knights, and you end up captured and executed.
{cps=50}Thus concludes the story of a man named [name], a rootless English militiaman who became a knight in the service of the French king, and then the most famous duelist in Castile.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 25 of 19.
{cps=50}After breaking through the Castilian knights and temporarily pushing them back, you get near de Roche's body lying on the ground.
{cps=50}He doesn't move, and blood trickles from his mangled helmet.{vspace=5}{w}Just as with the defeat on the battlefield, the realization comes to you immediately, but you refuse to accept it.
{cps=50}As you crouch down beside him and lift the visor of his helmet, you see that he is still alive, although he is on his last breath.
{cps=50}Looking you in the eye, de Roche says quietly...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}De Roche's eyes close.
{cps=50}After suffering defeat and taking flight in disarray, the remnants of de Roche's forces become easy prey for the Castilian and Granadian cavalry, which pursues them for a long while, leaving no chance to escape or hide.
{cps=50}The several thousand men with whom you left Navarre not so long ago simply vanish into thin air, dissolving without a trace among the Andalusian hills and sands.
{cps=50}After being taken prisoner by the Castilians, you are brought before King Pedro. True to his nickname, he subjects you along with the rest of his captives to brutal torture, by the end of which there are almost no survivors.
{cps=50}You withstand the torments, even though you become a mere shadow of your former self.
{cps=50}Having already accepted that you will spend the rest of your days in a Castilian prison, you are seriously surprised when, one day, you are suddenly taken from your cell and transported somewhere with a sack over your head.
{cps=50}Once the sack is removed, you see in front of you a person you least expected.
{cps=50}Upon returning to Paris, you appear before Raglan and then the King himself; despite the failure of the campaign, you still get generously rewarded for your service.
{cps=50}On top of that you are elevated from knight banneret to a count and granted rich land holdings, including some of those that previously belonged to Charles of Navarre himself.
{cps=50}All this, however, is of little interest to you, since you long to meet someone else - someone far more important to you than the king or his privy counsellor.
{cps=50}Someone, for whose sake you once replaced lions with lilies.
{cps=50}Someone, for whose sake you fought in Normandy, Brittany, and Paris.
{cps=50}Someone, for whose sake you almost perished in the Castilian sands.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Eva.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She takes the news of de Roche's demise hard.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}But, just as the cold of winter is always followed by the warmth of spring, her tears for her father soon give way to joy at the fact that you have returned alive.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And from now on you will always be together.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And so, in a bizarre twist of fate, the land where you once arrived with fire and sword for the sake of conquest and profit, now becomes your own home.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Home, for the peace and prosperity of which you have already spilled your blood and risked your life.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Here, surrounded by your wife and numerous children, you will spend the rest of your life — enjoying the well-deserved rest and reminiscing about your past adventures with nostalgia.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 26 of 19.
{cps=50}On the way back to Paris, you cross the entire kingdom from south to north, and once again, just as during the return from Rennes after the victory over the routiers, you personally witness the people's love for de Roche.
{cps=50}His name is equally renowned in Gascony, Toulouse, Angoulême, Anjou, and Blois. The lords gladly welcome him into their castles and estates, serve him the finest wines, and hold feasts in his honor. The peasants raise mugs of ale to his health in the roadside inns where you stay for the night.
{cps=50}After the solemn service in the Cathedral of Notre Dame, you and de Roche go to the public square. A royal envoy, dressed up in ceremonial attire, already awaits you there and announces that Guillaume de Roche, Comte de Lambert, is invited for a private audience with His Majesty King Jean, to be presented with deserved awards for defending the interests of the kingdom...
{cps=50}Along with [name], a knight banneret in the service of the crown.
{cps=50}Fascinated by the triumph of de Roche, you don't immediately realize the magnitude of your own triumph.
{cps=50}Yesterday's rootless peasant, who dug ditches in a siege camp near Cambrai and went on the offensive in rags and with a rusty sword in his hands, has now become a knight banneret, whom the King of France - not even summoned - {i}invited{/i} for a personal audience in order to thank for loyal service.{vspace=5}{w}And, very likely, lavishly bestow awards.
{cps=50}You have never been prone to vanity, and being 'in the shadow' of de Roche, a brilliant commander and a hero of the people, has not weighed you down. You were content with your current position, realizing that your accomplishments had already far exceeded your best expectations and you made an absolutely incredible career.
{cps=50}But now the King's representative himself spoke your name, and behind his back two carriages were already moving across the square.
{cps=50}You were no longer just a 'de Roche's man' or yet another nameless knight. Fate had something much greater in store for you.
{cps=50}Never in your life could you have imagined that you would end up here... But now, standing here and reflecting on what you have become, you clearly realize that this is still far from the peak, far from the limit of your ambitions and strength.
{cps=50}The path from a peasant to a knight is much longer than from a knight to a count. And a count is just a stone's throw away from a king.
{cps=50}Chuckling, you hop inside the carriage, the door of which is obligingly swung open in front of you by a servant.
{cps=50}A great future awaited you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The privy counsellor to the king appears in the carriage intended for you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Completely lost in your thoughts, you notice Raglan only after he greets you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The carriage sets off.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan turns to the window. Following his gaze, you watch de Roche's carriage swerve from the central street and disappear from sight.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ragland nods.
{cps=50}Eva takes the news of de Roche's demise hard. But, just as the cold of winter is always followed by the warmth of spring, her tears for her father soon give way to joy at the fact that you have returned alive.
{cps=50}And from now on you will always be together.
{cps=50}Your life is seemingly idyllic. However, neither the beautiful and loving wife, nor tremendous wealth and universal respect can help you to reconcile with yourself.
{cps=50}You lie to Eva. You lie well enough that she, blinded by her love for you, believes you.
{cps=50}You lie to yourself as well. You lie desperately and skillfully. Day after day, month after month, and year after year. But you never manage to actually believe your own lies.
{cps=50}Over the years, you become more and more hooked on wine, developing a vicious habit of not only ending the day with it, but also meeting the sunrise with it.
{cps=50}You try not to spend much time near open windows and high cliffs, and at nights you spend a long time sitting in your study with a dagger in your hands, every now and then touching the blade with your fingers.
{cps=50}Sometimes this feeling that eats you up from the inside recedes, and you, in disbelief, timidly try to enjoy your life. But after a day, a week or a month, it comes back again.
{cps=50}When you receive news of an uprising in Flanders, you join the royal army without hesitation.
{cps=50}In the very first battle, you barely wait for the signal to attack and rush headlong at the enemy without even lowering your visor. And you die with a smile on your face.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 27 of 19.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan sighs and closes his eyes briefly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan sighs again. Your answer was clearly not what he wanted to hear.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}However, in his usual manner, he shows no emotion and gets straight to the point.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan makes a meaningful pause.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raglan nods.
{cps=50}To Cambrai.
{cps=50}Eva takes the news of de Roche's demise hard.
{cps=50}You tell her the truth, and together you mourn her father for a long time.
{cps=50}But, just as the cold of winter is always followed by the warmth of spring, her tears soon give way to joy at the fact that you have returned alive.
{cps=50}And from now on you will always be together.
{cps=50}He wanted to see the French kingdom united and strong, and the king's power - unshakable. And he achieved what he dreamed of.
{cps=50}Even though at the cost of his life.
{cps=50}And you live out the rest of your days in Cambrai, surrounded by your wife and numerous children — enjoying the well-deserved rest and reminiscing about your past adventures with nostalgia.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 28 of 19.
{cps=50}Before Raglan's men manage to subdue you, you kill or injure about six of them.
{cps=50}You almost break free, but the privy counsellor, in his characteristic shrewdness, knows full well who he is dealing with and involves a whole army of soldiers to arrest you.
{cps=50}You spend the rest of this day, which began with a triumph, under arrest.
{cps=50}But fate decrees otherwise.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Looking out the window wistfully, he sighs tiredly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You've got nothing to discuss with de Roche at the moment.
{cps=50}You visit the routier camp in the vicinity of Pamplona...
{cps=50}Mercenaries require potent antidotes to treat an epidemic that has broken out in the camp...
{cps=50}Pedro's infiltrators poison one of the wells in the routiers' camp, which leads to an outbreak of dysentery that severely impacts your troops' combat capability.

{cps=50}You find Guy Bourguignon in the routier camp and ask him about the smuggler that de Roche mentioned.
{cps=50}The mercenary captain begins his story from afar.
{cps=50}According to him, despite the king's promise to fully provide the routiers with everything necessary during the Castillian campaign - that has not been the case.
{cps=50}The stipulated wages had been paid in full, but the farther they traveled from Paris, the scarcer the supply became.
{cps=50}To the extent that, on their arrival in Navarre, many of his men were literally left with no shoes, for the old ones were worn out, and neither new shoes nor money for their purchase were provided.
{cps=50}Left to their own resources, the routiers quickly made contact with a gang of local smugglers who promised to supply them with everything they needed for a ridiculously low price.
{cps=50}That price was paid, but, apparently determined to match the French king's integrity, they also decided not to honor the promise.
{cps=50}Most of the gang slipped away, but the routiers still managed to track down and capture one of the smugglers. And now, Guy Bourguignon says, he must answer for this on behalf of all his friends.
{cps=50}He hasn't been killed yet, but the number of his eyes, fingers, and plans for the future life has already begun to rapidly diminish.
{cps=50}After explaining that you require a guide who knows the local area well, you ask for the smuggler to be handed over to you.
{cps=50}The routier captain, in his characteristic manner, tells you that everything has a price.
{cps=50}You need a living smuggler, and his men need shoes without holes in them. And he wouldn't mind trading one for the other.
{cps=50}The opportunity to torture a deceitful smuggler to death is certainly a nice consolation prize, but, for your sake, he's willing to give it up.
{cps=50}New quest added - [last_honest_man.name!ti].
{cps=50}When you ask the mercenaries about the captured smuggler, you are told that he is already dead.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Acquaintance with the routier captain check failed!
{cps=50}Due to the dysentery epidemic, it is not possible to hire warriors in the routier camp...

{cps=50}Having received what he wanted, the routier captain hands you over the smuggler.
{cps=50}He introduces himself as Juan. Shaking with fear and badly beaten, he heartily thanks you for the rescue and agrees to repay you by serving as your guide.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}The option to select this guide will be available during travels.

{cps=50}You visit one of Pamplona's taverns...
{cps=50}After some thought, he suggests you talk to Alvar - a local hunter and a great friend of his - who, for a small fee, will easily take you wherever you need to go.
{cps=50}Upon hearing the price for Alvar's services, you realize you are being ripped off and refuse his services.
{cps=50}He says that he has accidentally overheard your conversation with Alvar and advises you not to do business with him, for he is notorious for his habit of profiteering from foreigners by making them pay three times the price for the services of a guide.
{cps=50}Introducing himself as Cristobal, the interlocutor offers you his own services, promising to escort you wherever you need to go for a significantly lower price.
{cps=50}Pedro's infiltrators poison one of the wells in the routiers' camp, which leads to an outbreak of dysentery that severely impacts your troops' combat capability.
{cps=50}While exploring the outskirts of Pamplona, you accidentally witness a group of brigands torturing some man.
{cps=50}After burying their victim up to his neck in sand, the bandits attempt to force him to give some information away. However, every time they remove the gag from his mouth, he only shouts curses and cries for help.
{cps=50}The brigands warn you not to get involved and inform you that the man buried in the sand is a murderer and a thief, with whom they have a personal score to settle.
{cps=50}Having dealt with the bandits, you free their captive.
{cps=50}Introducing himself as Pablo of Valencia, he confesses that in the past he indeed suffered from poverty and was forced to engage in robbery and theft, but those days are far behind him.
{cps=50}Now he is a devout and law-abiding Christian.
{cps=50}Upon hearing that you have recently arrived in Navarre, he offers to serve as your guide for the duration of your stay, as a token of his gratitude for saving him from certain death.
{cps=50}According to him, during his wanderings through the Navarrese, Castilian and Cordoban lands, he has thoroughly explored these parts and is now happy to help you in your travels.
{cps=50}After explaining how to find his home in Pamplona, he bids you farewell and leaves.
{cps=50}When you return to Pamplona, you go to the address that Pablo gave you, but he is (obviously) not present there, and none of the local residents have ever heard of him.
{cps=50}The battle is dragging on. Perhaps you should retreat to save your life...
{cps=50}Seeing that the battle is not going in your favor, you retreat back in Pamplona...

{cps=50}Having completed all of de Roche's errands and scouting the situation in the city, you decide to return back to the abbey.
{cps=50}After receiving your report on the state of affairs in the city and making sure his men are rested, de Roche gives the order to march towards the residence of Charles of Navarre.
{cps=50}You have to force your way across the bridge...
{cps=50}Seeing that the battle is not going in your favor, you retreat...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory snorts.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory snorts even louder.
{cps=50}After which the three of you head back to the city.
{cps=50}The bounty hunters' plan works perfectly: the guards let you into the city and then into the ducal residence without any trouble.
{cps=50}The only obstacles in your way are Olivia's bodyguards, who guard a separate wing of the residence.
{cps=50}Apparently forewarned of the possible appearance of Grace and Glory, they grab their weapons as soon as they see your trio.
{cps=50}Leaving you to handle the bodyguards, the bounty hunters break into the duchess's chambers...
{cps=50}Having dealt with Olivia's bodyguards, you follow Grace and Glory to the duchess's chambers.
{cps=50}But it's already over there, too.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As you look at the bloodied bounty hunters, you recollect how you taught Olivia the basics of fencing.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The lass has clearly turned out to be a talented student.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory wipes the blood from her face with her sleeve.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As the surge of adrenaline recedes, Glory's habitual confident smirk returns to her face.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory snorts.
{cps=50}The second part of Grace and Glory's plan works just as well as the first. After leaving the residence, you get to the wharf without any issues, where you embark on a small ship that's been waiting for you and leave Rennes behind.
{cps=50}Keeping in mind that the price for Olivia's head was set by the Inquisition, you expect a long journey to Avignon, which the bounty hunters mentioned earlier. However, instead of traveling to the south of the French kingdom, you head north.
{cps=50}To Paris.
{cps=50}Instead, they get contracts from intermediaries that act as liaisons between clients, who usually want to stay in the shadows, and contractors, who don't have to go door-to-door looking for work.
{cps=50}The intermediary from whom they received this contract, and who is now obliged to pay them under its terms, is someone named {i}Tarrare{/i}.
{cps=50}Tarrare the Purse.{vspace=5}{w}Tarrare the Glutton.{vspace=5}{w}Tarrare the Merchant of Death.{vspace=5}{w}Tarrare the Fixer.{vspace=5}{w}Tarrare the Middleman.
{cps=50}Grace and Glory don't go into any great detail regarding this man or their dealings with him.
{cps=50}However, judging by their conversations and the nicknames that they use to refer to him, you form an impression of him as an influential man who has acquaintances and business partners all over the kingdom. And not just in the high castles and pompous palaces, but also in notorious taverns and dirty backstreets.
{cps=50}The opportunity to ascertain the accuracy of this assessment is given to you as soon as you arrive in Paris, when you, in the company of Grace and Glory, visit his richly appointed mansion in the north of the capital.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory tosses her mechanical crossbow on the table in front of him.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare smiles.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare fixes his gaze on you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare nods with a smile and gives a sign to one of his servants, who disappears briefly before emerging with three pouches full of gold.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory touches the scars on her face.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She turns to Tarrare.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Grace, following Glory's example, also touches her injured face.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Convinced that both ladies have had their say, Tarrare replies.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare spreads his hands with ostentatious modesty.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}He makes a meaningful pause.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After exchanging a knowing glance with Grace, Glory once again tosses the pouch of gold in her palm.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After watching her leave, Grace rolls her eyes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare nods.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}5000 florins received.
{cps=50}During your stay in Paris, you receive an offer to enter the service of Bernard de Chatillon, an influential lord from southern France.
{cps=50}In a conversation with his cousin, who has arrived in the capital in search of suitable people, you learn that Seigneur de Chatillon needs a detachment of daredevils who are ready to go overseas - to Outremer - to find there and safely return his son, who went on a crusade.
{cps=50}The house de Chatillon took care of all the expenses for organizing the trip, and in case of the success of the enterprise, it also guaranteed a very solid reward, which would have allowed you to live comfortably for the rest of your life.
{cps=50}A contract that could bring you money - comparable to the bounty on Olivia de Montfort's head.
{cps=50}When you arrive at his place, you are surprised to find Tarrare engaged in conversation with your old acquaintances.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory folds her arms across her chest and turns away to the window.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare fixes his gaze on you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Grace and Glory, who have only now noticed your appearance, turn to you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Seeing both girls tense up, he makes a quick remark.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare's smile spreads even wider.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory snorts.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The bounty hunters' eyebrows creep up, and fire lights up in their eyes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory rolls her eyes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory wipes the blood from her face with her sleeve and glances at Olivia's body.
{cps=50}As Tarrare briefs you, you learn that, after the end of the war with England, de Roche has set out to quell the rebellion in Normandy. He is currently in Rouen, where he is organizing the defense of the city against the rebels, awaiting the arrival of the French king's army.
{cps=50}After receiving a solid down payment from Tarrare, you leave Paris.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}3500 florins received.
{cps=50}In Rouen, you get in touch with Tarrare's contact, who grants you the opportunity to get into the secured premises of the city's citadel, where de Roche is located, unimpeded.
{cps=50}Seeing how your Rouen mission so far almost perfectly replicates the events in Rennes that preceded Olivia's death, you start getting an odd feeling that things are going too smoothly.
{cps=50}And, as if in confirmation of your thoughts, you encounter a knight who finds something suspicious about Grace and Glory's appearance - just one corridor away from de Roche's chambers.
{cps=50}When the attempt to talk your way out of this fails, Glory takes a risky step and, taking advantage of the fact that the knight has let her out of his sight for a second, attempts to plunge the dagger she's snatched from inside her cloak into his neck.
{cps=50}And that's when the plan goes completely awry. Having been mortally wounded, the knight, instead of just dropping dead, starts making loud noises and clings to Glory with a death grip.
{cps=50}Leaving Grace to assist her and fight off the guards and onlookers rapidly flocking to the commotion, you burst into de Roche's chambers alone...
{cps=50}Having bruised all your bones from the fall and only by some miracle not shattered, all three of you manage to get lost in the narrow streets of Rouen before the soldiers arrive and cut off all escape routes.
{cps=50}You decide to lay low and hide in the darkest corners of the city for about a week, waiting until the heat dies down a bit.
{cps=50}When the turmoil you've caused begins to subside, you make your way out of the city.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Taking a close look at your pitiful appearance, he gently strokes his smoothly shaven chin.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare breaks out into a smile.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory raises her eyebrows in surprise.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare's smile grows even wider and takes on grotesque tones.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare rakes his eyes over some parchments covering his desk.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory struggles to contain her irritation.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare chuckles.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare breaks into his grotesque smile.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare bursts into an obnoxious laugh, which Grace impatiently interrupts.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare shakes his head with a smile.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Grace's expression changes instantly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare's broad smile turns cold.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You with Grace and Glory exchange puzzled glances.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory narrows her eyes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Grace cuts her off.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare once again breaks into his grotesque smile.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Outside the tavern windows you spot more and more incoming people.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare looks at each of you in turn.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Bidding you farewell with a subtle nod of his head, Tarrare leaves the tavern.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory fixes her gaze on the waitress wiping trays at the bar counter.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Following her gaze, Grace also starts scrutinizing the girl.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Grace and Glory turn to you in sync.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Without taking her eyes off you, Glory begins to whistle a song softly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Grace echoes her.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As befits true companions, the three of you synchronously reach for your weapons.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You cautiously glance outside the window again.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Grace catches Glory's gaze.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Glory gives the tavern a parting look.

{cps=50}And run.
{cps=50}Run as fast and as long as you can.
{cps=50}After miraculously escaping from the clutches of bounty hunters in Versailles and having no idea where to go next, you spend a few days wandering around the surroundings and eating what you can get in the forest.
{cps=50}After that, you join a caravan of traveling peddlers and arrive in Orleans. After living there for a couple of quiet months, you begin to think that the danger has passed, but at some point the bounty hunters find you there as well.
{cps=50}You are once again forced to flee, and you can think of nothing better than to join the royal troops from Paris passing through the city - on their campaign to Navarre and Castile.
{cps=50}The campaign, which, ironically, is led by none other than Guillaume de Roche.
{cps=50}Recognizing the joke that Providence has played on you, you accept the new rules of the game and, after being an adventurer, a mercenary captain, the right hand of the Duchess of Brittany, and - with varying success - a bounty hunter, you return to the trade from which you once started your career.
{cps=50}To the trade of a common soldier.
{cps=50}Having arrived safely with the troops in Pamplona, you participate in the Franco-Navarrese invasion of Castile.
{cps=50}Victories alternate with defeats, and successes - with failures, but in the end the war concludes with the triumph of de Roche and the dethronement of the Castilian king Pedro the Cruel.
{cps=50}According to witness accounts, you were among those French soldiers who victoriously entered the Castilian capital... But after that, your trail is lost.
{cps=50}Maybe you stayed in hot Iberia, or perhaps, believing that old grievances had been forgotten, you dared to return to France.
{cps=50}Or maybe you, tired of adventures in foreign lands, even decided to return home - to England.
{cps=50}Only one thing is certain - the bounty on your head has never been received by anyone.

{cps=50}At the appointed time, you meet with Grace and Glory to give Tarrare the money for information about De Roche...
{cps=50}Even when you empty your pockets you still don't have enough money...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[player_gold] florins lost!
{cps=50}Luckily, thrifty Grace has enough money to contribute not only Glory's share, who squandered all her money, but also yours.
{cps=50}Being furious with both of you, she nevertheless forks out...
{cps=50}You and Grace contribute your share of the sum.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}5000 florins lost!
{cps=50}Glory, having successfully squandered all her money earlier, is barely scraping together a fifth of the sum.
{cps=50}Having handed over the required sum to Tarrare, you receive information from him that De Roche has recently returned from Rouen and is in his Parisian estate under heavy guard - including from the king's own men.
{cps=50}It will be impossible for an armed person to get inside. The only way, according to Tarrare's spies, to overcome the outer ring of security is to get inside under the guise of ordinary workers who deliver food to the De Rocha estate and arrive there to work every morning.
{cps=50}Also, according to Tarrare, he has access to several servants working in the estate and, for a certain fee, they will be able to hide several items on the internal territory. Including weapons or armor.
{cps=50}So that, having entered without weapons or equipment, you can then arm yourself with something.
{cps=50}Having successfully passed through the outer ring of security, you enter the territory of De Rocha's Parisian estate under the guise of servants who have arrived for work.
{cps=50}De Roche himself, if we are to believe the information received from Tarrare, is in his own chambers inside the estate, on one of the upper floors.
{cps=50}To get to it, you will have to overcome several more well-armed guard posts in a short time.
{cps=50}Grace is injured and is out of the fight...
{cps=50}Seeing that the guards are receiving reinforcements and there is no longer a chance of success, you, taking advantage of the confusion, get out of the estate.

{cps=50}Not risking staying in Paris, which the royal bloodhounds would most likely turn upside down in search of the killers, the three of you leave the city and lay low in a village called Versailles.
{cps=50}After waiting a few days, you send a messenger to Tarrare, asking him for a meeting, and the next day he arrives in Versailles.
{cps=50}Grace, mortally wounded, falls to the ground. Glory, who has arrived, tries to lift her up and provide first aid, but all in vain.
{cps=50}And a second later you lose sight of her behind the backs of the enemies approaching her.

{cps=50}Having received information from Tarrare about de Roche, you prepare a plan of action: this time much more thorough and taking into account the bad experience of Rouen.
{cps=50}According to this plan, you and Grace are to infiltrate the estate disguised as peasants and look around.
{cps=50}Then, as soon as the moment is right, you will strike. While Glory, armed with a heavy crossbow, will cover you from a nearby hill.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}After breaking through a whole army of bounty hunters, you move towards a nearby forest, hoping to escape your pursuers there...
{cps=50}After breaking away from most of your pursuers, you delve even deeper into the forest.
{cps=50}Meanwhile, it's starting to get dark around here.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tarrare breaks into his hideous smile.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You've got nothing to discuss with Tarrare at the moment.
{cps=50}Having failed to eliminate your target quickly and made a lot of noise, you are forced to flee in order not to fall into the clutches of the city guards.
{cps=50}While you are being escorted, you attempt to steal one of the keys from the guard's belt...
{cps=50}Once in a new cell, you again wait for the right moment and use the stolen key to escape to freedom.
{cps=50}And soon you are securely locked in a dark cell, from which it is impossible to escape and the door of which will never be opened.
{cps=50}At this point, luck turns against you for a moment and you catch the eye of one of the guards. But, fortunately for you, he turns out to be dead drunk, so his attempts to stop you look extremely hesitant.
{cps=50}Armed with a chair that came to hand, you prepare to fight back.
{cps=50}After dealing with the enemies and taking their equipment, you decide what to do next...
{cps=50}Immediately head out into the courtyard, hoping to catch the remaining guards by surprise - or sacrifice the element of surprise and take a better look around?
{cps=50}You get out into the courtyard, where you literally come face to face with another group of guards, among whom are crossbowmen.

{cps=50}Charles' friendly gaze turns sharp, cold and unpleasant.
{cps=50}As you fight off the assassins, you hope that all the commotion from the battle will attract the attention of the servants and guards - and soon someone will come to your rescue.
{cps=50}Upon hearing the sounds of battle, de Roche's men come to your aid.
{cps=50}According to the captain, he has got informants in the local underworld and is now quite close to catching the outlaws, but he won't refuse any assistance either. So, if you manage to obtain some useful information, you are welcome to contact him again.
{cps=50}With no connections in the underworld, you can think of nothing better than to take a tour of Rouen's inns and taverns, hoping to glean some information through conversations, backed by a handful or two of coins.
{cps=50}You dodge this lunge, disarm the hapless hitman and then force him to flee.
{cps=50}You consider chasing after him, but he quickly vanishes in the narrow city streets.
{cps=50}Luckily for you, the hitman turns out to be quite a coward and, instead of attempting to finish you off, prefers to quickly vanish in the narrow city streets.
{cps=50}You report it all to the captain of the guard, and he immediately orders his men to arrange for the scoundrels' arrest.
{cps=50}The city guards successfully arrest the bandits, and so the food supply is now secure.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}As someone who has been on the opposite side of the law more than once, you effortlessly establish contact with the local criminal underworld and arrange a meeting with the ringleader.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue check passed!
{cps=50}When you meet him in person in a secluded place, the leader of the bandits confirms that he indeed plans to get his hands on some of the contents of one of the food depots - in order to make a substantial profit off food speculation by reselling them to the affluent citizens.
{cps=50}Moreover, if you help him to lay a false trail for the city guards, he is ready not only to guarantee you a solid cut of the proceeds, but also to help you escape from the city, in case the rebel troops gain the upper hand.
{cps=50}The robbery of the food depot leads to a brief panic in the city, as well as the desertion of a couple dozen soldiers, which naturally doesn't reflect well on the state of Rouen's defenses.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}The state of Rouen's defenses worsened!
{cps=50}De Roche, naturally, is also not thrilled with the work you and the captain of the guard have done.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}1500 florins received.
{cps=50}Without further ado, you draw your weapon.
{cps=50}However, you decide to act cleverly and convince the bandit leader that you accept his offer.
{cps=50}When you return to the captain of the guard, you report all your findings to him and assist him in apprehending the criminals.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}After you finish off the bandits, you bring good news to the captain of the guard and de Roche.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}You receive news that a gang of bandits has looted one of the food depots that had been stocked with provisions in case of a siege.

{cps=50}However, despite the promise made to you, the bandits do not keep their word and when you decide to utilize their help, it appears that they have long since disappeared.
{cps=50}Which is not too surprising, since, as it is well-known, there is no honor among thieves.
{cps=50}However, you are not destined to die in the capital of Normandy.
{cps=50}De Roche gets severely criticized and, despite his extensive experience, high status, and many years of faithful service, removed from command of the troops.
{cps=50}You, however, are treated even more harshly. Accused by royal officials of cowardice and of voluntary surrender of Rouen to the rebels, you, along with the few other surviving defenders of the city, end up under arrest.
{cps=50}After reaching the southern edge of Paris and crossing the Seine, you approach Raoul's lab...
{cps=50}Once done with the guards, you barge into the laboratory...
{cps=50}After receiving news that Raoul has been dealt with, the bandits inform you that they now have no quarrel with you and are willing to do business.
{cps=50}Having received what he wanted, the routier captain hands you over the smuggler.
{cps=50}[ally!ti] informs you about a laboratory not far from the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where dwells Raoul of Aragon - an alchemist and, coincidentally, the leader of a band of brigands operating in the southern suburbs of Paris.
{cps=50}If you're interested, [ally!ti], who got to know Raoul after doing some business together, is willing to put in a good word with him for you.
{cps=50}You would then be able to procure various rare potions from him, as well as some equipment.
{cps=50}You visit the alchemical laboratory of Raoul of Aragon...
{cps=50}First transported by carriage, then by ship, and then once more by carriage - all this lasts for so long that you manage to lose count of the days again.
{cps=50}And, once your blindfold is finally removed, you find yourself in a small fortress lost in the middle of mountain ranges in an unknown land.
{cps=50}You are once again put in a cell, and this time, apparently, for good.
{cps=50}After carefully inspecting the new place of your confinement, you notice that the back wall of the cell is seriously dilapidated and could collapse from heavy impact.
{cps=50}Despite the burning desire to try to get out immediately, you decide to proceed cautiously, take advantage of the fact that your cell now has a massive grate instead of a solid door, and spend the next few days waiting and studying your situation.
{cps=50}Among the observations you make, the main ones are the small number of jailers and their carelessness - the low-rank guards spend their time sleeping and drinking, and no one from the command checks on them.
{cps=50}On one hand, these observations give you confidence that escape is feasible...
{cps=50}On the other hand, however, the mountainous scenery you saw upon your arrival here suggests that you are somewhere in the far reaches of the kingdom. So even in case of a successful breakout, you risk ending up in some impenetrable wilderness that would be impossible to get out of.
{cps=50}Putting aside unpleasant thoughts, you reason that the most logical thing to do would be to deal with problems as they come up - which means you should focus on escaping first.
{cps=50}Having waited for an appropriate moment, you attempt to press the wall out as quietly as possible.
{cps=50}But no matter how hard you try, you don't succeed.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Strength check failed!
{cps=50}Out of desperation you lose your cool and make too much noise, which alerts the guards, who immediately transfer you to another cell.
{cps=50}While you are being escorted, you attempt to steal one of the keys from the guard's belt...
{cps=50}Once in a new cell, you again wait for the right moment and use the stolen key to escape to freedom.
{cps=50}And soon you are securely locked in a dark cell, from which it is impossible to escape and the door of which will never be opened.
{cps=50}The cell in which you spend the rest of your life.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 23 of 31.
{cps=50}And you succeed. One by one, the stones give in to your pressure and fall out, opening a passage into a niche between the walls, from which you move into the sewers and then to the floor below.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Strength check passed!
{cps=50}After dealing with the epidemic and finally restoring order in the bailiff's camp, you finally get a chance to see his troops for yourself.
{cps=50}Compared to the peasants of Oissel, the men assembled by the bailiff appear much more serious.
{cps=50}Almost all of them are quite well armed and clad in, albeit worn, yet still decent armor. Also, they have undergone basic combat training, thanks to which they are able to at least confidently draw swords from their scabbards without a risk of chopping off their fingers - and that's something.
{cps=50}However, almost none of them have any real military experience, so the bailiff, realizing that a clash with the rebels is imminent, suggests that you give his men a few lessons to get them up to speed.
{cps=50}And he, in turn, will make it worth your while and get you a fitting reward.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [exchanging_favors.name!ti].
{cps=50}You arrive at the bailiff's camp in order to conduct a few training sessions with the people he has assembled, yet you find no attentive students.
{cps=50}The soldiers, who have been pulled from all over the duchy, show little interest in Geoffroy's rebellion, in the fate of Rouen, or in anything else for that matter.
{cps=50}Their thoughts mostly revolve around the possibility of acquiring some ale and wine from the nearby roadside inn, as well as the possibility of dodging whatever work they are assigned to snooze for an extra couple of hours.
{cps=50}Given that you don't surpass them in social status and are not their immediate superior, you are unlikely to become a natural authority for them.
{cps=50}So, unless you want your training effort and time to go to waste, you have got to somehow win their attention and respect first.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: 1.
{cps=50}You decide to rely on your eloquence and deliver a motivational speech to the soldiers, in which you clearly and lucidly explain the importance of the current confrontation with the rebels, as well as the necessity of training.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And you succeed!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue, Prestige, Luck check passed!
{cps=50}Your motivational speech makes a great impression on the soldiers and convinces them to, at least for a while, forget about drinking and concentrate on training.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Yet you fail.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue, Prestige, Luck check failed!
{cps=50}Your motivational speech doesn't make much of an impression on the soldiers.
{cps=50}Unable to come up with anything better, you decide to take the path of least resistance and promise the soldiers that you will reward them with alcohol for every good training session.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Lost alcohol: 6.
{cps=50}That way you manage to win their favor.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough alcohol in the inventory!{vspace=5}Required: 6.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: 1.
{cps=50}Seeing that the discipline and motivation in the camp are not at their best, you decide to resort to classic drill and strengthen the soldiers' discipline and commitment through corporal punishment.
{cps=50}Reminding the bailiff's soldiers that the army is not a place with nothing to do but booze and stay in bed all day, you - in some cases with words of varying degrees of politeness, and in others with smacks and a strong boot - quickly restore discipline.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: 1.
{cps=50}As expected, the soldiers who are not eager to adopt your experience pay no mind to most of your instructions, and you manage to pass on only a few bits of your knowledge to them.
{cps=50}Having fulfilled your part of the bargain, you inform the bailiff that it is time for your reward.{vspace=5}As a token of his appreciation, he shares some of his equipment with you and also allows you, for a small fee, to recruit a few of his men into your squad.
{cps=50}Impressed by the attention that was bestowed personally on you by the King, one of the young noblemen present at the feast expresses a desire to join your squad.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige check passed!
{cps=50}He introduces himself as [wandering_knight_container_full_name!ti] and informs you that he will await your decision at his Parisian estate.
{cps=50}Recalling the offer to join your squad made by [wandering_knight_container_full_name!ti], you arrive at his Parisian estate...
{cps=50}[wandering_knight_container_full_name!ti] confirms that his offer still stands and he is ready to join your men immediately.
{cps=50}A messenger sent by Raglan delivers a warning that the counsellor's agents have got wind of a rumor about an assassination plot against de Roche.
{cps=50}Although his men have not yet been able to ascertain anything more concrete, Raglan recommends to keep an ear to the ground.
{cps=50}Raglan's fears are confirmed: a few days after his warning, de Roche's Parisian residence is indeed attacked by a group of unknown assailants.
{cps=50}At the same time, you, having just arrived to your boss to receive instructions regarding future assignments, become a witness to this attack and watch the battle unfold below from a nearby window.
{cps=50}You urge your chief to leave the residence before it's too late and take shelter in a safe place, but he responds with a firm refusal.
{cps=50}Citing the significant increase in security of the residence - which was also reinforced by king's men after Raglan's warning - de Roche is not greatly worried.
{cps=50}He refuses to hide in one of the secret rooms, much less flee - and suggests to just wait it out until his guards deal with the assassins.
{cps=50}Your arrival at the scene turns out to be very timely, as the assassins take out one de Roche's guard after another with their crossbows.
{cps=50}You draw your weapon and join the battle.
{cps=50}You agree with the logic of his arguments and prefer not to risk your life unnecessarily, sticking close to your chief instead.
{cps=50}De Roche turns out to be correct, and, after about a quarter of an hour of intense combat, the assassins get bogged down by the numerous guards and, unable to reach their target, retreat.
{cps=50}De Roche demands to mount a pursuit at once, however, those of his men who survived the attack are either wounded or extremely fatigued from the battle, so it is clear that sending them would be a futile endeavor.
{cps=50}Seeing that there is no one else to count on, you personally set off in pursuit.
{cps=50}Reasoning that there is only one place where the assassins could have retreated to - the nearby forest, you rush there...
{cps=50}You wish to set off in pursuit personally, but the voice of reason stops you.
{cps=50}Raglan's men take the bodies with them and promise to find out the identity of those two, as well as whoever has sent them, but something tells you that you won't learn anything of significance from them.
{cps=50}Reasoning that it would be most sensible to search for the mercenary in the Boulogne camp, you start making inquiries and questioning the camp's inhabitants...
{cps=50}The mercenary who won the sword from the young lad goes by the name of Pierre Four Fingers. An avid hustler and a great fan of gambling, he is one of Guy Bourguignon's men and, according to the information you have received, he is now planning to dispose of the sword - by selling it to someone for a substantial sum.
{cps=50}Having failed to achieve anything with mere questioning, you use additional tools of persuasion at your disposal - handfuls of florins... And little by little, you get their tongues to wag.
{cps=50}Soon enough you learn everything you need.
{cps=50}The mercenary who won the sword from the young lad goes by the name of Pierre Four Fingers. An avid hustler and a great fan of gambling, he is one of Guy Bourguignon's men and, according to the information you have received, he is now planning to dispose of the sword - by selling it to someone for a substantial sum.
{cps=50}You find Pierre in the camp...
{cps=50}You offer to buy the sword back from him, and he agrees to let you have it for 900 florins.
{cps=50}You hand the mercenary the money and retrieve the sword.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Item received - [decorated_bastard_sword.name!ti].
{cps=50}You let the mercenary know that you are interested in his sword and offer to gamble for it in a game of dice.
{cps=50}Pierre, whose eyes immediately light up with passion, agrees to accept your proposition, but only if you also put something substantial on the line...
{cps=50}Fortune favors the mercenary, and so he, chuckling, pockets the item he won from you, after which he readily offers you a rematch.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Luck check failed!
{cps=50}After telling the captain of the routiers the story of the young lad who lost his sword, you ask for his help in finding the mercenary and returning the sword.
{cps=50}Having entrusted the matter to one of his adjutants and then waited for his return for about half an hour, Bourguignon listens to the report, after which he returns to you.
{cps=50}According to him, the mercenary in question has indeed been found, but it will not be possible to simply return the sword, since neither your story nor the mercenary's statement included anything that would make his acquisition of the sword illegal.
{cps=50}The sword was not stolen or forcefully taken away from its previous owner, but was obtained as a result of an honest dice game, which both parties played voluntarily.
{cps=50}The fact that Anselm accuses his opponent of cheating means nothing, for that is the standard loser's excuse.
{cps=50}To sum it up, the captain of the routiers informs you that, if you still insist, he is willing to help in the return of the sword and, if necessary, to purchase it from the new owner at his own expense - but that would be in return for the favor he owes you.
{cps=50}If such an exchange does not suit you, then he has nothing more to offer you - for his man obtained the sword by fair means.
{cps=50}After securing a meeting with Guy Bourguignon, you tell him about the current situation and also remind him that he is in your debt.
{cps=50}Contrary to what one might expect, the mercenary turns out to be a man of honour (at least in this matter) and does not renege on his earlier promise.
{cps=50}However, as he reasonably points out, passing on a message from prison and quelling an uprising in a huge city are slightly unequal things.
{cps=50}Gratitude is gratitude, but nobody would undertake such a job for free. Taking your friendship into account, he is willing to make a good discount, but the final price would still be substantial.
{cps=50}Guy Bourguignon and his squad are ready to join you for 5,000 florins.
{cps=50}Guy Bourguignon agrees to take your side and marches with his men to the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}5,000 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}Mercenaries require potent antidotes to treat an epidemic that has broken out in the camp...
{cps=50}After obtaining the cure, you help combat the epidemic in the camp and restore the routiers' fighting capacity.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Item lost — [antidote2.name!ti].{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}After obtaining the cure, you help combat the epidemic in the camp and restore the routiers' fighting capacity.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Item lost — [antidote2.name!ti].{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}You find Guy Bourguignon in the routier camp and ask him about the smuggler that de Roche mentioned.
{cps=50}The mercenary captain begins his story from afar.
{cps=50}According to him, despite the king's promise to fully provide the routiers with everything necessary during the Castillian campaign - that has not been the case.
{cps=50}The stipulated wages had been paid in full, but the farther they traveled from Paris, the scarcer the supply became.
{cps=50}To the extent that, on their arrival in Navarre, many of his men were literally left with no shoes, for the old ones were worn out, and neither new shoes nor money for their purchase were provided.
{cps=50}Left to their own resources, the routiers quickly made contact with a gang of local smugglers who promised to supply them with everything they needed for a ridiculously low price.
{cps=50}That price was paid, but, apparently determined to match the French king's integrity, they also decided not to honor the promise.
{cps=50}Most of the gang slipped away, but the routiers still managed to track down and capture one of the smugglers. And now, Guy Bourguignon says, he must answer for this on behalf of all his friends.
{cps=50}He hasn't been killed yet, but the number of his eyes, fingers, and plans for the future life has already begun to rapidly diminish.
{cps=50}After explaining that you require a guide who knows the local area well, you ask for the smuggler to be handed over to you.
{cps=50}The routier captain, in his characteristic manner, tells you that everything has a price.
{cps=50}You need a living smuggler, and his men need shoes without holes in them. And he wouldn't mind trading one for the other.
{cps=50}The opportunity to torture a deceitful smuggler to death is certainly a nice consolation prize, but, for your sake, he's willing to give it up.
{cps=50}New quest added - [last_honest_man.name!ti].
{cps=50}When you ask the mercenaries about the captured smuggler, you are told that he is already dead.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Acquaintance with the routier captain check failed!
{cps=50}You visit one of the capital's large taverns...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You give Anselm the sword he previously lost.
{cps=50}The overjoyed lad thanks you and, as a token of his appreciation, takes a jeweled ring off his finger and hands it to you.
{cps=50}His gratitude doesn't end there, and he informs you that his family owns an atelier that specializes in dressmaking for the nobility and he would be happy to provide you with a first-class garment.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You pass a sword to Anselm - not the one he lost, but a very decent one anyway.
{cps=50}The lad thanks you and notices that although your sword is certainly different from the one he lost, there is a certain resemblance between them. And maybe his father - who he has long since retired from service, become visually impaired, and now retrieves his old armor and weapon only on holidays - will not notice the switch.
{cps=50}At least for a while.
{cps=50}As a token of his appreciation, the lad takes a jeweled ring off his finger and hands it to you.
{cps=50}You can always find quite a few adventure hunters in drinking establishments, who are willing to take on dangerous work...
{cps=50}You randomly strike up a conversation with one of the patrons, who turns out to be an old warrior.
{cps=50}Due to numerous injuries and wounds, he has decided to leave the war behind and is now looking for someone to buy his equipment - a complete set of weapons and armor.
{cps=50}Purchase a full set of plate armor and weapons for X florins?
{cps=50}You randomly strike up a conversation with one of the patrons, who is looking for a mentor in fencing.
{cps=50}You have nothing to offer him.
{cps=50}You randomly strike up a conversation with one of the patrons, who is looking for a mentor in crossbow shooting.
{cps=50}You randomly strike up a conversation with one of the patrons, who is looking for a mentor in alchemy and crafting.
{cps=50}You randomly strike up a conversation with one of the patrons - a young lad, who tells you that he is in serious trouble.
{cps=50}Having introduced himself as Anselm, the young man recounts that last night he was going on a date with his sweetheart and, in order to impress the girl as much as possible, he took his father's sword without asking...
{cps=50}...an expensive weapon, crafted by a famous master and bestowed upon my father by his liege as a reward for distinguished service.
{cps=50}However, on the way to his beloved's house, your unlucky interlocutor decided to stop by an inn and chug a mug of ale for courage.
{cps=50}One mug turned into two, two into four, and an hour later he got plastered.
{cps=50}At the same time, a group of mercenaries was celebrating a job well done in the same tavern. One of them spotted Anselm's blade and offered him a game of dice, putting all his equipment on the line for just his sword.
{cps=50}The lad agreed... And, of course, he got swindled in no time.
{cps=50}The mercenary was obviously a cheat, he says - yet he can't back this claim up with any evidence.
{cps=50}Either way, Anselm now swears that he will never touch alcohol again in his life and begs for any sort of help...
{cps=50}Help in retrieving his father's weapon or in acquiring any other ornate sword that would let him escape his parent's wrath - or at least delay and alleviate it.
{cps=50}You decide to head towards Anselm's atelier...
{cps=50}Once you reach Anselm's atelier, you take shelter there and get a small respite.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level decreased!
{cps=50}Anselm, who has not forgotten his gratitude to you, also offers you various weapons and equipment.
{cps=50}After saying farewell, you return to the streets of Paris...
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}De Roche spreads his hands.
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}De Roche sighs thoughtfully.
{cps=50}The Dauphin is being held under guard in the dungeons of the Conciergerie.
{cps=50}Realizing that the infiltration will be no easy task, you consider the available options...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Squad members of certain classes with a high enough level can assist you in various ways.
{cps=50}Hearing that you need to infiltrate the Conciergerie, [ally1_advice_name!ti] informs you that he can help you out somewhat.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Bard in the squad check passed!{vspace=5}Ally's level check passed!
{cps=50}According to him, he is acquainted with one of the captains of the guard - not a bad fellow overall, but he is mired in debt and is in desperate need of money because of it.
{cps=50}[ally1_advice_name!ti] is confident that the captain of the guard may well let you inside for a certain amount of money.
{cps=50}Acting as an intermediary, [ally1_advice_name!ti] helps you make contact with the captain of the guard.
{cps=50}The captain agrees to let you inside if you pay him 800 florins.
{cps=50}Hearing that you need to infiltrate the Conciergerie, [ally2_advice_name!ti] informs you that he can help you out somewhat.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Highwayman in the squad check passed!{vspace=5}Ally's level check passed!
{cps=50}According to him, a few years ago he was involved in a mass jailbreak from the Conciergerie. The level of security has been increased since then, obviously, but the key vulnerabilities remain unaddressed, so getting in and out should be fairly easy.
{cps=50}Having listened carefully to the instructions and guidance shared by [ally!ti], you decide that you are ready to try to infiltrate the Conciergerie this way...
{cps=50}At night, you make an attempt to sneak inside the prison under the cover of darkness.
{cps=50}Hearing that you need to infiltrate the Conciergerie, [ally2_advice_name!ti] informs you that he can help you out somewhat.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Peasant in the squad check passed!{vspace=5}Ally's level check passed!
{cps=50}According to him, he has been doing construction work before taking up a military career and, among other things, has participated in building one of the new towers of the Conciergerie, which provides access to the dungeons where prisoners are held.
{cps=50}The tower itself, he claims, can be reached by a secret passage under the waters of the Seine. So if you are a good swimmer and can hold your breath for a long period of time, it is quite possible to get inside this way.
{cps=50}After some consideration, you come to the conclusion that, once you've got some lockpicks and a pair of soft-footed shoes, you'll be able to get inside the Conciergerie on your own.
{cps=50}The outer ring of the guard becomes the first obstacle on your way...
{cps=50}You are forced to flee for your life.
{cps=50}Once you get past the outer ring of the guard, you end up at a locked door that leads directly into the dungeons of the Conciergerie.
{cps=50}Armed with lockpicks, you attempt to open the lock...
{cps=50}As you close the door behind you, you find yourself in the dungeons of the prison.
{cps=50}Eventually you are spotted by one of the jailers, who immediately raises the alarm, forcing you to flee.
{cps=50}Purchase a full set of plate armor and weapons for [paris_tavern_old_soldier_price] florins?
{cps=50}Not willing to waste any more precious time, de Roche gives the order to move out and, after just a couple of hours, you break into the ducal residence...

{cps=50}Having listened carefully to the instructions and guidance shared by [ally2_advice_name!ti], you decide that you are ready to try to infiltrate the Conciergerie this way...

{cps=50}His plan sounds completely insane, but the absolute confidence with which [ally4_advice_name!ti] presents his ideas to you is contagious. And, before he even gets to finish, you too get the feeling that his scheme actually has a good chance of succeeding.
{cps=50}The gist of his proposition is that [ally4_advice_name!ti] will set up somewhere beneath the walls of the Conciergerie and then start bellowing out some thug songs as loud as he can while accompanying himself on the lute.
{cps=50}Such a concert is guaranteed to attract the attention of both the prisoners, who would likely join in the singing, and the guards, who would surely try to put a stop to the performance.
{cps=50}To add to the confusion, it would do well to stock up with a couple of bottles of ale or wine to then share with the gawkers and vagrants who will be surely drawn to the commotion. 
{cps=50}And while the guards are breaking through them in an attempt to apprehend the musician, you will slip inside the prison under the cover of chaos.
{cps=50}And then it will be all up to you.
{cps=50}[ally4_advice_name!ti] turns out to be right, and events unfold exactly as he outlined in his plan.
{cps=50}Loud lute music and a self-pitying song about an imprisoned dashing rogue attract the attention of the prisoners, who join in the singing all together.
{cps=50}The nearby onlookers, who quickly flock to the noise and free alcohol, immediately form a bellowing and restless crowd around the singer.
{cps=50}While the Conciergerie guards are struggling to stop all this mayhem, you manage to sneak inside the prison.

{cps=50}Being a simple, yet quite resourceful man, [ally5_advice_name!ti] suggests to go in hard - put on cloaks with hoods, arm yourselves with clubs, wait until nightfall, knock out the guards at the right moment and sneak in.
{cps=50}[ally1_advice_name!ti] and you don cloaks and attempt to infiltrate the Conciergerie...
{cps=50}After deftly stunning a few guards who got in your way, you successfully make your way into the prison dungeons.
{cps=50}When you are sure that you have reached your destination, [ally1_advice_name!ti] retreats as previously agreed, leaving you all to yourself.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You do not have the required items in the inventory!{vspace=5}You need a cloak/hood and a club to infiltrate the prison by this method.
{cps=50}After some consideration, you come to the conclusion that, once you've got some lockpicks and a pair of soft-footed shoes, you'll be able to get inside the Conciergerie on your own.
{cps=50}The outer ring of the guard becomes the first obstacle on your way...
{cps=50}You are forced to flee for your life.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Dauphin sighs.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Dauphin raises his eyebrows.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You remain silent.
{cps=50}The Dauphin sighs again.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You attempt to continue the conversation, but the Dauphin is no longer interested in talking to you.
{cps=50}You have no choice but to return empty-handed.
{cps=50}Trying not to make too much noise, you start heading in the opposite direction...
{cps=50}But suddenly, you are called out by someone from one of the cells adjacent to the dauphin's.
{cps=50}The unknown inmate clearly wishes to speak with you, but it may be dangerous to linger in this place...
{cps=50}You agree to hear him out.
{cps=50}The inmate introduces himself as Bertrand Bourguignon and claims to be the younger brother of Guy Bourguignon, a captain of a large squad of routiers prowling the outskirts of Paris.
{cps=50}Bertrand asks you for a small favor - to simply visit one of the taverns on the outskirts of the city and quietly tell the owner of the establishment which wing of the castle and which cell he is kept in.
{cps=50}Everything else, including the payment of a very substantial reward, will be handled by his brother.
{cps=50}You don't waste your precious time on him and hastily get out of the Conciergerie.

{cps=50}However, at some point, your strength runs out as well.
{cps=50}Those last sparks of life that still lingered in your body despite countless tortures and torments finally fade away and death overtakes you.

{cps=50}The count's tactical prowess cannot compensate for the exhaustion of his troops. The rebels begin the battle confidently and withstand your first blow, but as soon as it is followed by the second and third, Canterbury's army begins to crumble.

{cps=50}In response, the captain of the routiers informs you that he is always interested in high-paying jobs.

{cps=50}Realizing the overall precariousness of your situation along with the presence of enemies in both the west and east, you, on the advice of Alyssa and the new privy council established by her, decide to dissolve the Parliament and be crowned immediately.
{cps=50}Control of Windsor would allow the Oxonian forces to cut London off from all supply sources and put the city under siege, which would be extremely difficult to withstand.
{cps=50}The best way to avoid a siege would be to either recapture Windsor and maintain its control...
{cps=50}...Or to inflict a decisive defeat on Canterbury's forces in a field battle.

{cps=50}With Windsor under your control, you manage to foil Canterbury's forces' attempt to advance towards the capital and lay siege to it.
{cps=50}Unable to seize the situation, the Oxonians abandon their attempts to advance on London and the initiative passes to you.
{cps=50}Your first trial on the royal throne can now be considered concluded, but now, having secured the capital from the enemy, you find yourself facing a truly difficult question...
{cps=50}Should you once again put everything on the line and organize your own military campaign against Oxford, in an attempt to finally crush the rebels and gain control of most of the kingdom...
{cps=50}Or choose not to risk your life and crown, but instead focus on consolidating power and bringing order to the lands you already hold under your control.
{cps=50}You don't wish to face the count's army in a field battle and decide to prepare London for the siege.
{cps=50}Upon approaching the city, Count Canterbury's troops encircle it...
{cps=50}...and almost immediately launch a major assault.
{cps=50}You and your men face the enemy on the walls.
{cps=50}Thanks to the provisions you've stockpiled, the city manages to withstand a prolonged siege.
{cps=50}Seeing that starving London out is not an option, Canterbury orders a major assault on the city.
{cps=50}Lacking extensive stockpiles of provisions, the city soon ends up in a very dire situation.

{cps=50}However, there is nowhere for you to retreat, for the outcome of this battle will determine the fate of the entire Kingdom of London...
{cps=50}In accordance with English law, you decide to announce the creation of a new militia for the defense of the kingdom and oblige every village and town within the lands you control to field an established number of soldiers.

{cps=50}At some point, however, as is often the case, a single spark is all it takes for this widespread discontent to explode into a huge popular uprising.
{cps=50}Before you can even react, an armed mob of commoners is already under the walls of the royal residence, while your guards flee in panic to escape the peasants' wrath.
{cps=50}You also make an attempt to escape, but the fate decrees otherwise and you end up captured by the infuriated rebels.{w}{vspace=5}At whose hands you perish.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}After a failed assault on the capital and a disorderly retreat from its walls, Canterbury has ended up in a vulnerable position and you've got a real chance to crush him. The second such opportunity may never be presented again, so you are willing to take a risk.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Number of troops, Authority, Amount of controlled territory check passed!
{cps=50}You gather all available troops and march on Oxford.
{cps=50}Bereft of solid fortifications, the city that Canterbury chose as his base of operations could not be expected to withstand a long siege. So it was up to the battered rebel army to defend it in a field battle.
{cps=50}Skillfully taking advantage of the terrain, the count places his troops on top of several hills, which are flanked by a forest and a river. You have no choice but to attack him head-on, hoping to crush the rebels with brute force.
{cps=50}You don't have enough resources to march on Oxford!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Number of troops, Authority, Amount of controlled territory check failed!
{cps=50}War has brought you to the throne, and now your heart is aching for another campaign to crush your enemies and earn even more riches and glory.
{cps=50}But you are no longer an ordinary soldier or a knight following orders. You are a king, and now too much depends on your decisions. Failure at Oxford could easily not only undo all your accomplishments, depriving you of both crown and life, but also doom Alyssa, who, without your protection, is guaranteed to be hanged. Or to suffer a much worse fate.
{cps=50}In these circumstances, you make a decision that you feel is the only right one. A decision not of a warrior, but of a king.
{cps=50}And instead of marching troops on Oxford, you send there emissaries to propose an armistice.
{cps=50}In the meantime, you are actively working to restore order in the war-weary lands that are part of the Kingdom of London, which has just proved its right to exist.
{cps=50}Seeing that Canterbury himself and his retinue are hastily leaving the battlefield, you decide to pursue him.
{cps=50}You don't want to get into a fight with the count's bodyguards, but you clearly realize that no victory will be complete without the death or capture of Canterbury.
{cps=50}If he slips out of your hands here, he will surely reappear soon enough - with even more sophisticated intrigues and an even larger army.
{cps=50}An end to the confrontation between London and Oxford must be put here and now.
{cps=50}Accompanied by your guards, you chase after him and soon catch up.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your men take Canterbury's small entourage in a semi-circle.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As you get closer to the сount, you are about to offer him to surrender...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}However, seeing the same coldness in his eyes and the same stone mask of unwavering arrogance on his face, you begin to lose faith in the success of the peace negotiations.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Even after losing his army and finding himself surrounded and outnumbered, he does not look willing to bow his head and lay down his arms.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Canterbury makes a subtle gesture with his hand.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ruffin snatches a crossbow from under his cloak in a single motion and fires a bolt in your direction without aiming.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}In the next instant, you receive a heavy blow to the chest that knocks you out of the saddle and to the ground.{vspace=5}Agility, Coordination check failed!

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}However, thanks to your incredible reflexes and inhuman agility, you miraculously manage to dodge the bolt.{vspace=5}Agility, Coordination check passed!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}For a moment, you notice a trace of surprise on Ruffin's scarred face.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Having gotten used to being the strongest warrior in any fight during his long military career, Ruffin was firmly convinced that dodging a bolt at such a distance shouldn't be possible.{vspace=5}{w}If only because he himself wouldn't have been able to do it.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}But the man standing in front of him has done just that.{vspace=5}{w}Which means that - for the first time in very many years - he is facing someone who surpasses him in skill.
{cps=50}One by one you send Canterbury and Ruffin to the afterlife, turning today's victory into an unequivocal rout and burying any attempts at further resistance by the Oxford Alliance.
{cps=50}The very next day, the city surrenders to you without a fight, and the rebellious lords who were on Canterbury's side either come to you on their knees seeking mercy or hastily abandon their estates and flee - to the north, to the Continent, or to the narrow strip of southern land controlled by Northampton.
{cps=50}After taking possession of the royal relics, you triumphantly return to London, one step closer to becoming a full-fledged ruler of all England.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Although you are not afraid of Alyssa, you are perfectly aware of the enormous danger she will pose the second you and she are on opposing sides of the conflict.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She was involved in the formation of the privy council of the Kingdom of London, and some of the men who sit there were selected by - and therefore are loyal to - her directly. But does she have any other informants and agents among your people?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Who can you trust to carry out an order for her arrest?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And won't you end up being the one locked up as a result?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Having no answers to these questions, you are inclined to believe that enlisting the duke's help would be the most appropriate decision.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The duke makes a sign to one of his servants, and a few minutes later you are joined by two unknown ladies.
{cps=50}Following instructions from Grace and Glory, you invite Alyssa to join you on a trip to Oxford to commemorate the final incorporation of those lands into the Kingdom of London with this symbolic gesture.
{cps=50}In response to Alyssa's concerns about the safety of this venture, you assure her that most of the royal army is now stationed in the area and therefore there is nothing to fear - the escort of a small squad of personal guards should be more than enough for complete peace of mind.
{cps=50}At first Alyssa hesitates, but vanity gets the better of her. The desire to make her first visit as a queen to captured Oxford and gaze triumphantly at the defeated enemy's stronghold that has been forced into submission is too great.
{cps=50}And she agrees.
{cps=50}Her bloodied lips quiver, and the maddened glare of her uncomprehending eyes darts around.
{cps=50}Then she notices you and tries to say something. Her lips move, but you can't make out the words.
{cps=50}You jump off your horse and lean over to dying Alyssa.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You touch her cheek.{w}{vspace=5}She's colder than ice.
{cps=50}The story of the queen's tragic demise in an ambush set up by Northampton, which also nearly claimed the life of the king himself - who survived only by a miracle - turns out to be quite touching.
{cps=50}Thanks to the efforts of the Duke of Cambridge and his many assistants, the news quickly flies all over England and not only clears you of suspicion of organizing the assassination of your own wife, but also promotes a kind of whitewashing of your image - turning a belligerent upstart usurper into a righteous avenger of his unjustly murdered wife.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The duke nods understandingly.
{cps=50}Once you are back in the capital, you order the head of the privy council to arrest Alyssa.
{cps=50}Despite the fact that you have already decided Alyssa's fate, the counsellor's question as to what should be done with her next still leaves you lost in thought.
{cps=50}Obviously, this story can't end in anything other than her death.{w}{vspace=5}However, does she deserve... {w} A last word? {w}A farewell to you? {w}An apology?
{cps=50}After all, no matter who she was, she never turned her back on you. She never hid her intentions for you.
{cps=50}However, you, as befits a true politician, don't let sentimentality blind you.
{cps=50}This is not the time or place for feelings.{w}{vspace=5}Alyssa must die.{w} Right now.
{cps=50}This very evening, an executioner carries out your sentence in one of the secluded courtyards of the royal residence.
{cps=50}As you observe Alyssa's final moments from the balcony, you give credit to the stoicism with which she accepts her death.
{cps=50}Without uttering a single word or shedding a single tear.
{cps=50}Was your act a betrayal?{w}{vspace=5}Of course it was.{w} There is no point in lying to yourself.
{cps=50}But it is also true that the whole chain of events that led to Alyssa's date with the executioner's axe and farewell with her own head was set in motion by herself. By her ambition, her ruthlessness, her lust for power.
{cps=50}And, most importantly, by the betrayal that she initiated.{w}{vspace=5}And now, the fire Alyssa had started has consumed the arsonist herself.{w}{vspace=5}The circle has closed.
{cps=50}You exhale with relief.{vspace=5}{w}But at that moment, several armed men enter your chambers after the privy counsellor.
{cps=50}And you realize that relief was premature.
{cps=50}Confirming your worst fears, Alyssa enters the room last.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Authority check failed!
{cps=50}Half a dozen crossbowmen standing around her simultaneously shoot at you, piercing your body with many bolts and dropping you to the floor.

{cps=50}In the inns and in the market squares, to the delight of idle gawkers, they drag your name through the mud and spread all sorts of rumors defaming your honor.
{cps=50}What will be your response?
{cps=50}You intend to shut their mouths with your good deeds, not with the guards' metal gauntlets.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Authority decreased by [player_kingdom_authority_change].
{cps=50}He informs you that the kingdom's treasury is completely empty, and, in order to keep the state institutions functioning, it is imperative to immediately seek some funds: [storyroll] florins.
{cps=50}The chief treasurer promises to consider the possible options.
{cps=50}He promises to do everything possible, but immediately notes that it will be possible to save such a sum only at the expense of large staff reductions of civil servants, which will not reflect well on the governability of the kingdom.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Authority decreased by [player_kingdom_authority_change].
{cps=50}He reports that he has thought through several options to introduce new taxes.
{cps=50}Thus, he says, it is possible to either impose additional land taxes on the noble class...
{cps=50}Or increase taxes on the peasants by doubling the amount of fees for hunting, gathering brushwood, and fishing in the royal domain.
{cps=50}He informs you that he leads a detachment of Genoese crossbowmen, previously hired by the late king and engaged first in the French campaign and then in the confrontation with Count Canterbury's forces.
{cps=50}The captain says that he and his men would now like to continue their service under your command.
{cps=50}You accept the offer.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[storyroll] florins lost.{vspace=5}1,000 mercenaries have enlisted in your service.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}You refuse.
{cps=50}He reports disturbing news of Northampton's numerous spies who have allegedly infested the entire kingdom's administrative apparatus and urges you to immediately grant him permission to organize the arrests and executions of all suspicious individuals.
{cps=50}You agree and give him carte blanche for the harshest and most drastic measures.

{cps=50}You agree with the necessity of arrests, but demand extreme selectivity.

{cps=50}He reports that a recent fire destroyed several residential quarters of the capital and asks for funds to eliminate the consequences of the disaster and organize at least minimal assistance to the affected citizens.
{cps=50}He sadly informs you that your court physician has died while testing some new experimental medicine on himself and you are now left without the care of a medical professional.
{cps=50}You order to find a replacement for him.
{cps=50}You decide that you'll manage without a physician just fine.
{cps=50}He introduces you to a young lady named Anna from Rennes, who, according to him, is a talented physician, alchemist, and a suitable candidate for the role of court physician.
{cps=50}The lady's competence raises doubts in your mind and you turn her down.
{cps=50}He complains to you about Anna, your new court physician.
{cps=50}According to him, Anna does not show proper respect for religion and makes inappropriate comments about clerics.
{cps=50}Moreover, on one occasion she even dared to argue against the irreversibility of death, which is blatant blasphemy and an attempt to challenge the Lord Himself.
{cps=50}People like her have no place at the royal court.
{cps=50}She asks your permission to open her own alchemical laboratory and produce goods for sale.
{cps=50}She promises to pay large taxes to the treasury on a regular basis from her earnings.
{cps=50}You deny her request, ordering her to focus on her immediate duties.
{cps=50}He reports numerous complaints against Anna, your court physician.
{cps=50}She is accused of organizing all sorts of heinous experiments - including ones on the bodies of the deceased, which her men allegedly dug up at one of the capital's cemeteries.
{cps=50}Anna's actions are increasingly frowned upon by both members of the royal court and the commoners, who start receiving more and more news of her shenanigans.
{cps=50}He brings you a huge pile of paperwork with financial statements for the last few months.
{cps=50}You thank him for the work well done.
{cps=50}After reviewing the documents, you express your dissatisfaction with the amount of funds received by the treasury and demand to find additional ways to replenish the royal budget.
{cps=50}In accordance with your orders, he has explored the possibilities of introducing new taxes and fees...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Authority check passed!
{cps=50}He offers you the following options...
{cps=50}He, citing the hard times the kingdom is going through, asks that the Church be exempted from paying taxes.
{cps=50}He reports that the Archbishop of Canterbury has defected to Count Canterbury and has fled from London to Oxford.
{cps=50}Having joined the rebels, he now denigrates your name and calls upon all good Christians in England to take up arms against the Kingdom of London, which he calls the Devil's plaything.
{cps=50}He reports that he has devised an operation to physically eliminate the fugitive Archbishop of Canterbury.
{cps=50}You don't like the idea and you order him to let the archbishop live.
{cps=50}You order not to interfere with the privy counsellor's work.
{cps=50}He proposes to erect a new cathedral in the capital in honor of your ascension to the throne.
{cps=50}This symbolic gesture, he claims, will not only demonstrate the divine origin of your royal ambitions, but will also increase your popularity among the clergy.
{cps=50}He reports that the Archbishop of Canterbury, dissatisfied with the outcome of his meeting with you, makes not the most flattering remarks about the new authorities.
{cps=50}Being a politically sophisticated person, the archbishop expresses himself with extreme caution and ambiguity, avoiding incitement and outright insults. However, the meaning of his words is quite obvious to everyone.
{cps=50}They address you with a proposal to organize a great tournament, where the best warriors of the kingdom would fight in duels.
{cps=50}In their opinion, it would not only enhance the prestige of your authority, but would also serve as a great entertainment for all your subjects.
{cps=50}You refuse.
{cps=50}He complains that, with the de facto division of England into several independent and opposing lands, many of the roads and routes which were formerly considered perfectly safe have now plunged into utter lawlessness.
{cps=50}As a result, the transportation of goods became much more dangerous and expensive, while cases of missing shipments and deaths of caravanners are now far more frequent.
{cps=50}All this is a serious blow not only to the wallets of merchants, but also to the royal treasury, which, if nothing changes, will lose a fair share of profits.
{cps=50}To remedy the arisen state of affairs, the provost of the merchants asks you to assign several military detachments, which would escort the caravans, as well as restore order on the most dangerous routes and roads. The merchants are willing to provide the troops with provisions.
{cps=50}He informs you that the blacksmiths at the court are ready to craft your very own armor - richly decorated, reliably protecting from any attacks and absolutely not restricting movement.
{cps=50}They draw your attention to the extremely low cohesion and coherence in your army.
{cps=50}According to them, the motley bands that make up the army of the Kingdom of London have no experience in cooperation, and most of the commanders do not even know each other.
{cps=50}All this could easily lead to a disaster on the battlefield. So, in their opinion, it would make sense to organize drills to develop cooperation within the troops.
{cps=50}He provides you with a list of the lords who did not show up for the military drill you announced.
{cps=50}All of them provided formal excuses, explaining their absence with all sorts of reasons of varying degrees of validity. However, in the opinion of the court steward, these are nothing more than excuses.
{cps=50}Some of them, however, refuse to come to the court, once again citing some problems. Those who do come, however, evidently pay no mind to your words.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Authority decreased by [player_kingdom_authority_change]!{vspace=5}Popularity (nobility) decreased by [player_kingdom_rep_nobles_change].
{cps=50}He puts forward an initiative to organize a general troop review - call all your vassals with their detachments to the capital to assess all the forces that are truly under your command.
{cps=50}Which, he says, would give you a good idea of how many loyal men you have, as well as how well armed and ready for battle they are.
{cps=50}You agree and order to organize a troop review.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: 1{vspace=5}Troop cohesion increased!{vspace=5}Battle plan quality increased by 3!
{cps=50}You refuse this idea.
{cps=50}He reports that the Thames has partially overflowed its banks and flooded several city blocks after a series of recent downpours.
{cps=50}He therefore asks you to allocate money to help the flood victims as well as to fund the reconstruction works.
{cps=50}He addresses you with a proposal to build a hospital for wounded soldiers in the capital, where they could be treated and rehabilitated.
{cps=50}You refuse.
{cps=50}He reports that due to the constant expansion of the kingdom's bureaucratic machine, the monarch's residence is beginning to run out of space to accommodate all the officials and other personnel.
{cps=50}He therefore proposes to expand the royal residence by adding several additional buildings to it.
{cps=50}You refuse.
{cps=50}Having suffered a series of severe defeats on the battlefield, Scottish King James is no longer willing to continue the war and now actively seeks an end to the conflict.
{cps=50}Scottish envoys arrive at your court and propose to restore the pre-war borders and make peace.
{cps=50}You agree and make peace with Scotland.
{cps=50}You refuse to negotiate.
{cps=50}Having decided that actions speak louder than any words, you brutally execute all of King James' envoys at one of London's central squares and, to the roar of the crowd, vow to end the war with the complete defeat of Scotland and its subjugation to the English crown.

{cps=50}King James, outraged by your antics, also vows to wage war to the bitter end and makes every possible effort to gather more troops.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}The number of Scottish troops has been increased!
{cps=50}This time, in addition to restoring the status quo, he also offers to pay you an extensive war indemnity of [storyroll] florins.
{cps=50}You agree and make peace with Scotland.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}[storyroll] florins received.
{cps=50}You refuse to negotiate.
{cps=50}After defeating King James' forces, you annex Scotland!
{cps=50}Not having enough troops, you don't dare to leave the capital to repel the attack.
{cps=50}You decide to send a detachment to defend the region.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}[kingdom_of_london_prisoners_captured_temp] enemy soldiers captured!
{cps=50}[storyroll!ti] is now under your control!
{cps=50}The armed men accompanying Alyssa draw their weapons and rush at you.
{cps=50}After eliminating Alyssa, you cement your alliance with the Duke of Cambridge with a formal treaty, in which the duke swears an oath of allegiance to you and recognizes his lands as a part of the Kingdom of London, and you, in exchange, entrust him and and the men he handpicked with a number of key government posts.
{cps=50}Also, through the duke's mediation, you begin negotiations with Scotland, which claims some of the northern lands of the former Kingdom of England.
{cps=50}Formally these territories are under the jurisdiction of London, but in reality, due to the widespread chaos and the ongoing war with Northampton that ties your troops down in the south, you have no real forces in the north.
{cps=50}With this in mind - and in order to avoid a potential war on two fronts - the Duke of Cambridge suggests that you cede the disputed territories to the Scots so that you can concentrate on Northampton and finally end the civil war.
{cps=50}Settling scores with the northerners, he says, will be possible later - when all internal enemies have been defeated.
{cps=50}The duke's arguments convince you - even with his quite diminished resources, Northampton is still a dangerous foe and spreading out your forces now would be a huge mistake. Potentially a fatal one.
{cps=50}You decide to cede disputed territories to the Scots.
{cps=50}The Duke's mediation efforts, meanwhile, help turn the settlement of land issues into a pretext for rapprochement between London and Edinburgh.
{cps=50}In return, as a sign of his gratitude, King James of Scotland provides you with financial aid and even sends a modest band of his knights to fight at your side against Northampton.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9A9}500 Scottish knights join your forces.{vspace=5}15,000 florins received!
{cps=50}With each passing month, day, and even hour of your reign, you become more and more convinced that the English lands - all of them without exception - are your lands. And you will not cede them to anyone else.
{cps=50}Convinced of the firmness of your position, the Duke of Cambridge tells you that he will try to delay the negotiations and buy more time to defeat Northampton. However, you will not be able to fool the Scots for long, and you should prepare for a tough confrontation.
{cps=50}You decide to embark on a campaign to capture Greenwich, which is held by loyalist forces that are led by Northampton...
{cps=50}You decide to embark on a campaign to capture Chippenham, which is held by loyalist forces that are led by Northampton...
{cps=50}You decide to embark on a campaign to capture Bristol, which is held by loyalist forces that are led by Northampton...

{cps=50}You decide to launch an attack on Scottish-held lands...
{cps=50}You decide to launch an attack on Scottish-held lands...
{cps=50}You decide to launch an attack on Scottish-held lands...
{cps=50}The rapid advance of Scottish troops far inland, coupled with London's utter inability to hold them back, is a catastrophic blow to your personal reputation, as well as to the credibility of the royal authority as a whole.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Control of key regions check failed!
{cps=50}A conspiracy instantly hatches at the court and soon enough you are arrested by your own men and swiftly executed.
{cps=50}Thus ends the story of King [name]'s reign.
{cps=50}Despite the seemingly colossal advantage you had when confronting Northampton, the campaign resulted in a radical shift in the balance of power.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Control of key regions check failed!
{cps=50}After inflicting a series of defeats on the Kingdom of London, the earl managed to capture a number of key regions, cutting London off from all the southern and western lands of the kingdom.
{cps=50}However, it was not so much the loss of the lands that dealt a truly fatal blow to your standing, but the concomitant collapse of your authority in the eyes of your subjects and allies.
{cps=50}Seeing your utter inability to deal with a vastly inferior opponent, your vassals turn their backs on you and swear allegiance to Northampton one after another, merging their troops into his growing army.
{cps=50}Amid these events, a conspiracy instantly hatches at the court and soon you are arrested by your own men, who - also in a hurry to oblige the new favorite in the struggle for the all-English crown - execute you and send your head to Northampton's court.
{cps=50}Thus ends the story of King [name]'s reign.
{cps=50}After Northampton reclaims a number of lands from you, his human and financial resources, as well as the prestige of his faction, are seriously increased - causing a number of your allies to turn their backs on you...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Control of key regions check failed!{vspace=5}Northampton's army has been increased!
{cps=50}Having completed your preparations, you send your troops to Maidstone to finish Northampton off at last.
{cps=50}After capturing Dartford almost without a fight, you rapidly advance southward and, in a series of small battles around Maidstone, defeat all of the earl's assembled detachments in detail before seizing the town itself.
{cps=50}The second enemy pocket of resistance is now also destroyed, and the conducted military campaign is so brilliant that it will be soon celebrated in songs.
{cps=50}The only fly in the ointment is Northampton, who once again, just as back in London, predictably slipped out of your hands and disappeared in an unknown direction.
{cps=50}However, now deprived of all resources and allies, he is hardly a threat to you.
{cps=50}Even on the approach to Maidstone your vanguard and rearguard detachments several times fall into ambushes that were masterfully arranged by the Earl's men. As a result, they suffer serious losses.
{cps=50}Tired of sustaining small yet painful defeats in minor skirmishes, you force Northampton's troops into a general battle, which the earl accepts with surprising ease.
{cps=50}The reason for such determination of the enemy becomes obvious to you only on the battlefield, when you see an army under the earl's banners - which is almost twice larger than yours.
{cps=50}Having ended up deep in foreign territory, with vulnerable communications and an enemy army in front of your nose, you are denied any room for maneuver and are forced to accept the battle.
{cps=50}And this battle proves fatal to you.
{cps=50}With his characteristic ruthlessness, Northampton unleashes all of his available forces on you and simply overwhelms you.
{cps=50}Here, in the fields near Maidstone, the Kingdom of London perishes along with its king.
{cps=50}As you fight off several enemies in front of you, you don't notice someone going around you and delivering a heavy blow to your head from behind.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Stunned!{vspace=5}Concussed!{vspace=5}Bleeding!{vspace=5}Stamina has been reduced!
{cps=50}While fending off enemy blows, you catch a glimpse of several crossbowmen entering the room.
{cps=50}Clearly nervous, Alyssa immediately commands them to shoot.
{cps=50}They raise their weapons and attempt to take aim, but the commotion of the melee combat between you and Alyssa's men is too great, and they fail to get a clear shot at the target time and time again.
{cps=50}Their hesitation infuriates Alyssa - she cusses and curses the indecisiveness of the shooters, then snatches a crossbow out of the hands of the nearest of them.
{cps=50}Her clumsy grip on the weapon gives away the fact that she's not a good shot.{vspace=5}{w}Yet beginners are notoriously lucky.
{cps=50}Without any thought of the possibility of hitting her own men, she points the crossbow in your direction and fires a bolt that hits you right in the leg.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Leg injury!{vspace=5}Health decreased by 15!
{cps=50}Obeying Alyssa's commands, the rest of the crossbowmen also shoot, one after another.
{cps=50}Most bolts fly past you or injure your enemies, however a couple of them hit you directly.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Arm injury!{vspace=5}Health decreased by 25!
{cps=50}It feels like Alyssa has deployed an entire army against you. However, despite the huge numerical advantage, her men are unable to oppose you - they are no match for you in terms of fighting prowess.
{cps=50}One by one, you defeat them all.
{cps=50}Yes, she's far smarter and more sophisticated than you when it comes to politics, subterfuge and intrigue.{vspace=5}{w}Yes, you made a mistake.{vspace=5}{w}Yes, she outplayed you.
{cps=50}But so what? Any web of intrigue is easily cut with a sword. And you've got one right in your hands.
{cps=50}Alyssa was meant to die. And she will die. Right here, right now.
{cps=50}As you kill the last of Alyssa's knights, you raise your head triumphantly, searching with your eyes for the one who was hiding behind their backs.
{cps=50}Half a dozen crossbowmen standing around her simultaneously shoot at you, piercing your body with many bolts and dropping you to the floor.
{cps=50}Thus ends the story of King [name]'s reign.
{cps=50}King Alexander the Third died after falling from his horse.{w} Emperor Frederick drowned.{vspace=5}{w}You were killed with a crossbow.
{cps=50}Every man has his own destiny.
{cps=50}Such an end to negotiations de facto leaves you and the duke in a state of war with each other.
{cps=50}However, in an effort to set priorities correctly, you decide that it would be more logical to strike at Northampton first, who seems to you to be a more dangerous opponent, but also in a more vulnerable position at the same time.
{cps=50}The earl has lost some of his supporters after you usurped the throne and now holds only a narrow strip of land in the south, so he doesn't have the resources for a long military campaign.
{cps=50}Which is why you can well count on the fact that, once you've crushed him in one swift blow, you will then be able to turn your attention to Cambridge in the north.
{cps=50}After defeating all other pretenders to the throne, you end the protracted civil war and unite England in its pre-war borders under your control.
{cps=50}The whole kingdom now lies at your feet, willing to obey the will of its new ruler and eagerly waiting to see what kind of monarch you will become...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The civil war ended with your victory!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Now you can run the kingdom as you see fit and decide whether to focus on domestic politics and economic development...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Or take your chances and embark on new military campaigns to expand your lands and attain more glory.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Scottish King James still hopes to take advantage of England's weakness and conquer new lands.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Now that all other enemies have been defeated, it's time to fight him back!
{cps=50}You decide to launch an attack on Scottish-held lands...

{cps=50}You decide to launch an attack on Scottish-held lands...
{cps=50}You decide to seek help from the Italian city states and, for an agreed upon sum of money, receive a quite combat-capable fleet, even though not the largest. With it, you will be able to organize the safe transportation of troops to the continent.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}In an effort to expand your international influence, you decide to embark on a campaign in Iberia, where England's ally Pedro the Cruel has recently been deposed from the Castilian throne by the French and replaced by their own puppet.
{cps=50}And even though Pedro himself has been killed, his many supporters are willing to continue the struggle. And there is a figure who has actively tried to rally them around self - Maria de Padilla, Pedro's favorite and the mother of his several illegitimate children, who also hails from a very noble and influential family.
{cps=50}Enjoying extensive support both within and beyond Castile, Maria, however, is still in a very precarious position due to the fact that her relationship with the late Pedro was never officially legitimized.
{cps=50}As a result, she and her relatives are now desperate for any means to add political weight to their cause - including bringing influential allies to their side.
{cps=50}Such as foreign monarchs, for instance.
{cps=50}Another circumstance that makes the expedition to Iberia very attractive is the fact that Enrique de Trastámara - the current king of Castile and a protégé of the French - has not yet firmly established himself on the throne and does not have a large military force.
{cps=50}And what he has got is hardly a match for your veterans who have been through countless campaigns.
{cps=50}The Iberian pie has already been baked and carefully placed on the table. All that is left for you to do now is to head over there and eat it.
{cps=50}After forming an alliance with Maria de Padilla and supporters of the deposed King Pedro, you organize an expedition to Iberia.
{cps=50}You choose the outskirts of the small port town of Santander to the north of Burgos, the capital of Castile, as your disembarkation point.
{cps=50}Your first challenge is to quickly capture this town.
{cps=50}Your attempted assault fails - stuck under the walls of Santander, the English army loses the surprise factor, giving King Enrique a chance to rally his troops.
{cps=50}However, not all is lost and luck may yet turn your way...
{cps=50}You decide to launch a new assault...
{cps=50}Unwilling to take any more risks, you decide to return home.
{cps=50}In order to restore order, you have to resort to brutal punishments and even a series of public executions.
{cps=50}The capture of Santander opens up a direct route to the capital of Castile, but your Iberian allies, with whom you planned to join forces after the town was taken, are still gathering troops.
{cps=50}If you give them more time, you'll be able to increase the size of your army with allied detachments, but King Enrique will also get a chance to gather more men to repel your invasion.
{cps=50}King Enrique and his army meet you in the outskirts of the capital.
{cps=50}Armies engage in battle....
{cps=50}The battle with the Castilian forces ends in your defeat.
{cps=50}Lacking the resources for a long campaign, you decide to return home.
{cps=50}Despite the indecisive outcome of the battle, King Enrique's resolve is undiminished and he does not leave the battlefield, clearly intending to continue the fight tomorrow.
{cps=50}The Iberian allies are ready to supply your troops with food, but will you find the resolve to continue the confrontation...
{cps=50}You decide to fight with King Enrique's troops, which receive reinforcements during the night, once more.
{cps=50}Unwilling to take any more risks, you decide to return home.
{cps=50}Having won the battle, you occupy the capital of Castile on the same day.
{cps=50}Enrique is captured and then imprisoned, while the throne, thanks to your support, is given to King Pedro's underage bastard Alfonso, who is crowned as Alfonso XII.
{cps=50}The real power is concentrated in the hands of Maria de Padilla and her relatives, from among whom regents are appointed to care for the young ruler.
{cps=50}After gaining an ally in Iberia and enriching yourself with spoils of war, you return home.
{cps=50}The Duchy of Cambridge remains the only independent fragment of the old kingdom not subject to London. Playing hard to get and waiting for a better opportunity, the duke missed the chance to join either Canterbury or Northampton and ended up alone with you.
{cps=50}If a year or especially two years ago you were quite willing to make serious concessions in order to drag him to your side, now that time has passed.
{cps=50}However, the duke has still got a trump card up his sleeve - an alliance with the Scots, which has fully materialized while you were busy closing the Maidstone question definitively.
{cps=50}After crossing the northern border, which has long remained unprotected by anyone, Scottish troops rush south.
{cps=50}Realizing that they are aiming to join forces with the Duke of Cambridge's troops, you nevertheless decide not to rush in a hurry to defeat them in detail, but on the contrary, spend all available time assembling an army and mobilizing all available resources.
{cps=50}The failed expedition to France and the subsequent protracted internecine war have led to the devastation of many lands of the kingdom and the depletion of the treasury, but, on the other hand, left behind a huge number of veterans - battle-hardened men who had gone through many fights and gained invaluable experience.
{cps=50}The Cambridge and Scottish forces, on the other hand, are far fresher, so most of them don't have even a quarter of such expertise.
{cps=50}With your rich experience in waging wars and personally participating in them, you know well that one experienced soldier, led by a capable commander, could be worth five or even ten recruits. Therefore, having gathered a full army of seasoned veterans, you could well expect to defeat the combined forces of Cambridge and the Scots in a pitched battle.
{cps=50}You are about to test the truth of this belief on a plain between Cambridge and London, where the two armies have met for a general battle.
{cps=50}After arranging your troops according to a disposition conceived in advance, you move forward at the head of your soldiers. As soon as you are spotted on the battlefield, one of the noble Scottish knights immediately directs his squad straight at you...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}And your legacy, which you pass on to your descendants and which will be written next to your name in historical treatises, ends up being this kingdom split into three pieces, weakened and mired in petty internal conflicts.
{cps=50}Such is fate. As a truly exceptional warrior, you dared to reach for the stars and try on the royal crown. You had the strength to seize it in a moment of chaos and universal weakness, but couldn't accomplish anything else.
{cps=50}Having amused your own vanity and inflated your ego, this gambit brought nothing to the rest of the kingdom but another series of ruinous and bloody wars, the loss of many of the borderlands that were snatched away by the neighbors, and long decades of instability.
{cps=50}When you had a chance to secure for yourself a tiny but respectable place in history as an unrivaled warrior and a man loyal to duty, you decided to aim higher. And you got what you wanted, going down in history as a king and leaving a truly big mark in the annals.
{cps=50}Except that now, instead of words 'dignity' and 'valor', your name on the pages of treatises is often neighbored with the terms 'treachery', 'usurpation', and 'tyranny'.
{cps=50}You'll remain on the throne for almost three decades, outliving Canterbury, Northampton, and even King James, who will die in a war in France, where he would go to help his allies. You will meet your death from sickness in your own bed, surrounded by a loving wife and numerous children, to the eldest of whom you will pass the crown.
{cps=50}However, your established dynasty is not destined to last, and two years after your death England will be plunged into war yet again, which will reunite the fragments of the former kingdom into a single whole. Your dynasty will be trampled, and the few surviving descendants will be scattered across Europe.
{cps=50}But this, however, is a completely different story.
{cps=50}You gather all available troops and once again organize the defense of the capital, but this time the forces are too unequal, and after a short siege London is captured by the armies of the triple alliance.
{cps=50}You fall in battle while defending the gates of the royal residence with few loyal men, and Alyssa takes poison in her bedroom while watching from a window as enemy flags are raised one by one on the fortress walls.
{cps=50}The newly created Kingdom of London disappears from the face of the earth as a misunderstanding, the memory of which will not even be preserved in annals and treatises.
{cps=50}Despite the seemingly colossal advantage you had when confronting Northampton, the campaign resulted in a radical shift in the balance of power.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Control of key regions check failed!
{cps=50}Eager to demonstrate your commitment to the Christian faith, you consider embarking on a crusade - like the great rulers of the past.
{cps=50}After a long consultation with your advisors, you opt for Tunisia, which is under Muslim Berber rule and serves as a base for Tyrrhenian and Mediterranean pirates.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your army has been enlarged by [storyroll] men!{vspace=5}[player_kingdom_gold_change] florins received!
{cps=50}The enemy fortifications do not allow you to land a large force on the shore at once, so you will have to rely on a small squad to seize a beachhead.
{cps=50}The assault fails...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Stocks of provisions decreased by 1!
{cps=50}After successfully capturing the coastal fortress, you get the opportunity to put your troops ashore and finally start preparing the siege of Tunis itself.
{cps=50}The city's garrison, according to scouts, numbers about 2,000 warriors, and its defense is mainly organized around two bastions - the western and eastern. Once they fall, the fate of the city will be sealed.
{cps=50}Both of them, however, are superbly fortified, so it would be extremely difficult to capture them without preparation.
{cps=50}Having exhausted your stocks of provisions, you find yourself forced to return home.
{cps=50}Your crusade ends in nothing.
{cps=50}You send a squad of your men to assault enemy coastal fortifications.
{cps=50}You decide to personally lead an assault team, then gather the most experienced warriors and launch a daring attack on the enemy coastal fortifications.
{cps=50}Unwilling to take any more risks, you decide to return home.
{cps=50}The assault fails...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Stocks of provisions decreased by 1!

{cps=50}Your crusade ends in nothing.
{cps=50}Unwilling to take any more risks, you decide to return home.
{cps=50}The fall of both bastions seals Tunis's fate - its capacity for defense is now virtually exhausted.
{cps=50}Realizing this, the sultan sends envoys with an offer of surrender to you.
{cps=50}He agrees to become an English vassal, pay out a war indemnity, send you regular tribute, and allow Christian priests to freely settle in Tunisia and preach in the local churches.
{cps=50}His only condition is that the city must not be subjected to plunder and slaughter.
{cps=50}You accept his offer and, having received the agreed upon war indemnity, return home victorious.
{cps=50}The successful campaign in Tunisia not only brings you fame across the entire Europe as the chief defender of the Christian faith, but also secures your reputation of a truly noble man who is ruthless towards his enemies but merciful to the vanquished.
{cps=50}You reply to him that the defeated have no right to dictate the terms and should only meekly accept their fate - and then you let your men plunder Tunis.
{cps=50}By the end of the day, rivers of blood flow down the city streets, and many districts are engulfed in flames.{vspace=5}{w}Truly, woe to the vanquished.
{cps=50}After collecting rich booty and leaving a viceroy behind to manage the conquered lands, you sail back.
{cps=50}The successful campaign in Tunisia brings you fame across the entire Europe as the chief defender of the Christian faith, but it also makes you a model of bloodthirsty cruelty - even to those who have already bowed down before you and could have hoped for a better fate.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}[player_kingdom_gold_change] florins received.{vspace=5}Virtue increased by [storyroll].
{cps=50}Having united all the disparate English territories under your rule, you are crowned once again - but this time not as the head of the self-proclaimed Kingdom of London, but as the full-fledged king of all England.
{cps=50}Having tasted life under your rule, most of them have concluded that it is no worse than it was under the old king. In fact, it has become even better in many respects.
{cps=50}By mercilessly exploiting ordinary hard workers with exorbitant taxes of all kinds, restricting their freedom with harsh laws, and conscripting them en masse just to drown the next battlefield in their blood, you turn the population against yourself completely.
{cps=50}And thus you will be remembered by the common folk not as a victorious king and a military genius, but as a cruel usurper, torturer and tormentor of his own people.
{cps=50}They did appear to be enough to win the civil war, but serious and long-term support from the nobles is out of the question.
{cps=50}Also, it doesn't take long for the occasions for new conflicts to appear.
{cps=50}Having failed - although according to many of them, you have not even bother trying - to build friendly relations with the noble houses, you prefer to communicate with the nobility exclusively from the position of force - with orders, threats and ultimatums.
{cps=50}This approach works for a while, but by the end of the civil war, all bridges between you and the nobility have been burned.
{cps=50}This causes some of the noble houses to openly express discontent, ignoring half of your orders and maintaining only a nominal semblance of obedience.
{cps=50}And those who remain loyal do so with such a loud grinding of their teeth that it is obvious to everyone that they will not hesitate to swear allegiance to a new liege lord - be it another pretender to the throne or a foreign monarch who would decide to invade England - at the slightest opportunity.
{cps=50}You've gained a reliable ally by consistently taking steps to strengthen the church's position and regularly demonstrating your personal commitment to the Christian faith.
{cps=50}Priests all over the kingdom praise your name and tirelessly explain to parishioners as to why the throne is currently occupied by the most worthy man of all.
{cps=50}By not focusing on the church, you do not infringe on its rights, but you also do not provide it with any special preferences.
{cps=50}The clergy, in return, acts in the same manner towards you. While refraining from criticizing you in any way, the priests do not express any support for you either.
{cps=50}By depriving the church of its privileged position and exploiting it for your own purposes, you lose the support of the priests.
{cps=50}Having defeated your opponents on the territory of England, you turn your gaze outward.
{cps=50}Your expedition to the Iberian Peninsula proves to be a failure, and a French ally settles firmly on the throne of Castile.
{cps=50}The chain of failures that started at Cambrai reaches its logical conclusion and leads to the complete loss of English influence on the continent.
{cps=50}Having defeated the Saracens, you conquer new territories in Africa - and with them you gain a bridgehead for further expansion on the Black Continent.
{cps=50}The difficulties in supplying an army so far from home, as well as the determination of the defending Saracens, bury your plans. And force you to return to England empty-handed.
{cps=50}You hold the crown with a truly iron grip that no one will be able to loosen.
{cps=50}Even though the massive battles have already played out, there is still a lot of struggle for power - with covert intrigues and conspiracies - ahead.
{cps=50}The authority of your power is unquestionable only on paper, and its absolute status is no more than a figure of speech.
{cps=50}The throne shakes beneath you.
{cps=50}You found the kingdom split apart, impoverished and war-torn - and left it rich, strong and, most importantly, united. Devoid of serious internal strife and ready to once again fight for a dominant role in Europe.
{cps=50}After you've gone through a fair share of wars, you find yourself deeply entangled in the kingdom's numerous internal problems.
{cps=50}Without trusted advisors and friends to rely on when it comes to running the state, you have to personally delve into all sorts of issues - including those in which you have absolutely no competence.
{cps=50}The effectiveness of such an approach turns out to be naturally low, and all the subsequent years of your reign are characterized by economic stagnation, internal instability and a complete lack of success.
{cps=50}You manage to keep the throne - but not to leave a notable mark in the history of the kingdom besides one short line in the annals.
{cps=50}In the end, you become just a single line in the annals and are remembered in history as a misunderstanding at the junction of eras.
{cps=50}You decide to embark on a campaign to capture Chippenham, which is held by loyalist forces that are led by Northampton...
{cps=50}You decide to embark on a campaign to capture Bristol, which is held by loyalist forces that are led by Northampton...
{cps=50}You decide to embark on a campaign to capture Greenwich, which is held by loyalist forces that are led by Northampton...

{cps=50}You decide to embark on a campaign to capture Maidstone, which is held by loyalist forces that are led by Northampton...
{cps=50}You decide to embark on a campaign to Central England, which is controlled by the Duke of Cambridge...
{cps=50}You decide to launch an attack on the Duke of Cambridge's stronghold...
{cps=50}You decide to launch an attack on Scottish-held lands...
{cps=50}You decide to launch an attack on Scottish-held lands...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}Realizing that if you give up the initiative completely, the enemy's many thousands of troops could simply cut off all supply routes to the capital and starve the city - you decide to take the risk.{w}{vspace=5}And brace yourself for a field battle.
{cps=50}Cunning political moves and sophisticated intrigues have played their part, and now they must give way to cold steel.
{cps=50}The fate of the Kingdom of London and all of England is to be decided in the fields near London.
{cps=50}After gathering all available troops, you give the enemies a battle at the walls of the capital, but fortune turns away from the Kingdom of London.
{cps=50}Your men take heavy casualties under enemy attacks and start fleeing the battlefield.
{cps=50}In an attempt to salvage the situation, you and your squad of bodyguards make a desperate attempt to break through to the center of the enemy army and take down one of the commanders to disrupt their control over the troops.
{cps=50}But you don't succeed.
{cps=50}Once you're stuck in a thick formation of enemy soldiers, you get surrounded, knocked off your horse, and killed under a hail of blows.
{cps=50}Alyssa dies along with you - she has been observing the battlefield from her bedroom window and has taken poison the moment the outcome of the battle became ultimately clear.
{cps=50}The newly created Kingdom of London disappears from the face of the earth as a brief misunderstanding, the memory of which will not even be preserved in annals and treatises.
{cps=50}Your resounding victory at the Battle of London puts a decisive end to all attempts by [storyroll!ti]King James to wipe out the Kingdom of London.
{cps=50}The remnants of the defeated enemy troops scatter around the countryside and disappear in the vast fields and forests of southern England.
{cps=50}The [storyroll2!ti]Scots will clearly not be able to raise a second such army, so you can forget about new invasions in your lands from the north for a long time to come.
{cps=50}Having decisively rebuffed King James's troops, you put a decisive end to all attempts by [storyroll!ti]the Scots to wipe out the Kingdom of London.
{cps=50}Time is on your side, and so the lack of military successes and casualties, as well as financial and logistical difficulties soon force King James to pull his troops back north - where they can be more easily fed, reinforced, and resupplied.
{cps=50}The situation in the south is also calming down.
{cps=50}The loyalists, who have never fully recovered from your betrayal, are still lacking a formidable force, and now - after your convincing victory over the Scots - Northampton has finally abandoned his attempts to reclaim London.
{cps=50}Instead, he prefers to concentrate his efforts on consolidating his power in the south.
{cps=50}Having shattered their spears against your defenses, London's rivals finally lose the initiative in the war.
{cps=50}The unpleasant reality of the situation, however, lies in the fact that your own resources appear to be completely depleted as well.
{cps=50}This bloody and protracted civil war, which has been exacerbated immensely by the intervention of northern neighbors, has ravaged and devastated the English lands - and your domain has suffered perhaps the most of all.
{cps=50}So any retaliatory strikes against weakened enemies could now only be dreamed about.
{cps=50}As it often happens, the realization of this stalemate situation does not come to all sides immediately, and for about a year and a half after the defeat of Scottish forces under the walls of London, skirmishes and small battles continue all over England.
{cps=50}[storyroll!ti][storyroll2!ti][storyroll3!ti] and you actively continue to scheme and attack each other's border castles and fortresses, while never abandoning the attempts to gather a new large army.
{cps=50}But each subsequent clash consistently turns out to be smaller in scale than the previous one, and the budget of each subsequent military venture is more modest than the one that preceded it.
{cps=50}The same goes for their results.
{cps=50}In the end, realizing the futility of the conflict's continuation, as well as feeling the growing pressure from the nobility, clergy and merchants, all sides sit down at the negotiating table.
{cps=50}And, after several months of diplomatic battles and a series of forced mutual concessions, England - now officially - splits into several separate independent lands.
{cps=50}You are left with London, its environs, lands to the west of the capital, and a portion of Count Cantebury's former holdings.
{cps=50}The troops loyal to the earl attempt to oppose your army, but to no avail.
{cps=50}As you advance southward rapidly, you capture all of the regions held by Northampton one by one and then defeat the remnants of his forces in a general battle at Maidstone.
{cps=50}The fall of Maidstone marks your complete takeover of all lands south of London and the final collapse of the old loyalist faction that opposed you.
{cps=50}The only fly in the ointment is Northampton, who once again, just as back in London, predictably slipped out of your hands and disappeared in an unknown direction.
{cps=50}However, now deprived of all resources and allies, he is hardly a threat to you.
{cps=50}You lead your armies northward and inflict a series of defeats on the Duke of Cambridge's forces while taking control of his vast holdings.
{cps=50}Firmly believing that the Scots will come to his aid, the duke refuses to abandon his citadel and give it up for plunder until the very end.
{cps=50}However, his calculations are not justified, and, instead of his allies, it is your men who are the first to appear under the walls of his stronghold.
{cps=50}After several hours of a fierce assault, the duke's citadel is captured and the duke himself becomes your prisoner.
{cps=50}You transport him to London and then hold a show trial over the duke, who is found guilty of sedition and treason against the crown - and then sentenced to death.
{cps=50}The sentence is carried out in the main square of the capital in front of a cheering crowd of many thousands.
{cps=50}The Duchy of Cambridge remains the only independent fragment of the old kingdom not subject to London. Playing hard to get and waiting for a better opportunity, the duke missed the chance to join either Canterbury or Northampton and ended up alone with you.
{cps=50}If a year or especially two years ago you were quite willing to make serious concessions in order to drag him to your side, now that time has passed.
{cps=50}However, the duke has still got a trump card up his sleeve - an alliance with the Scots, which has fully materialized while you were busy closing the Maidstone question definitively.
{cps=50}After crossing the northern border, which has long remained unprotected by anyone, Scottish troops rush south.
{cps=50}Realizing that they are aiming to join forces with the Duke of Cambridge's troops, you nevertheless decide not to rush in a hurry to defeat them in detail, but on the contrary, spend all available time assembling an army and mobilizing all available resources.
{cps=50}The failed expedition to France and the subsequent protracted internecine war have led to the devastation of many lands of the kingdom and the depletion of the treasury, but, on the other hand, left behind a huge number of veterans - battle-hardened men who had gone through many fights and gained invaluable experience.
{cps=50}The Cambridge and Scottish forces, on the other hand, are far fresher, so most of them don't have even a quarter of such expertise.
{cps=50}With your rich experience in waging wars and personally participating in them, you know well that one experienced soldier, led by a capable commander, could be worth five or even ten recruits. Therefore, having gathered a full army of seasoned veterans, you could well expect to defeat the combined forces of Cambridge and the Scots in a pitched battle.
{cps=50}You are about to test the truth of this belief on a plain between Cambridge and London, where the two armies have met for a general battle.
{cps=50}After arranging your troops according to a disposition conceived in advance, you move forward at the head of your soldiers. As soon as you are spotted on the battlefield, one of the noble Scottish knights immediately directs his squad straight at you...
{cps=50}As a result, the crisis of relations between the aristocracy and the monarch, which in part prompted many lords, led by Count Canterbury, to oppose the rightful heir of the deceased king, is completely overcome.
{cps=50}The defenders of London manage to repel the assault, and Canterbury's troops retreat to Oxford with heavy losses.
{cps=50}You pass your first test as king with flying colors, but now, having repelled an enemy attack on the capital, you find yourself facing a truly difficult question...
{cps=50}Should you once again put everything on the line and organize your own military campaign against Oxford, in an attempt to finally crush the rebels and gain control of most of the kingdom...
{cps=50}Or choose not to risk your life and crown, but instead focus on consolidating power and bringing order to the lands you already hold under your control.
{cps=50}The end of the civil war allows Alyssa to finally proceed with her plans for marriage.
{cps=50}The preparations she starts turn out to be so large-scale that for a while they literally overwhelm the entire kingdom.
{cps=50}The workshops are flooded with huge orders for outfits and jewelry, the hunting grounds are procuring hundreds of all kinds of game, and countless barrels of the best wines are purchased in France, Italy, and Castile.
{cps=50}Your wedding with Alyssa becomes a grand event, which brings together the entire cream of the new English aristocracy and marks the full-fledged entry of England - which fell apart, but then rose from the ashes like a phoenix - into a new era.
{cps=50}Along with its new king and its new queen.
{cps=50}As you hold Alyssa's hand and recite the vows of fidelity, you see her eyes filled with love and happiness...
{cps=50}And suddenly realize that - despite all her willfulness, arrogance, and manipulative nature - Alyssa has always cared about you and acted solely in your best interests.
{cps=50}Even though she understood them, naturally, somewhat differently.
{cps=50}Later that day, after you leave the lavish ceremony behind and escape the thousands of invited guests, you retreat with her to one of the castle's balconies with a picturesque view.
{cps=50}Laying her head on your shoulder, Alyssa, as if in an outburst of reciprocal frankness, suddenly confesses that, when she was forced to cede the leadership role to you during the civil war, she gave up control to someone else for the first time in her life.
{cps=50}And she liked it.
{cps=50}Liked feeling like a weak and defenseless girl who makes no crucial decisions - next to a strong and noble man.
{cps=50}And she is happy that she experienced this feeling thanks to you.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You've got nothing to discuss with Alyssa at the moment.
{cps=50}At first Alyssa hesitates, but in the end she gives in. Tired of sitting in London for months in an atmosphere of constant danger, she cannot deny herself the pleasure of finally getting out of the capital.
{cps=50}Even more so when it involves such a symbolic gesture as traveling to conquered Oxford, the captured stronghold of a vanquished enemy and the very embodiment of the victory of the Kingdom of London - and Alyssa personally - over the most dangerous foe.
{cps=50}The story of the tragic demise of the king's beloved in an ambush set up by Northampton, which also nearly claimed the life of the sovereign himself - who survived only by a miracle - turns out to be quite touching.
{cps=50}Thanks to the efforts of the Duke of Cambridge and his many assistants, the news quickly flies all over England and not only clears you of suspicion of organizing the assassination of your own wife, but also promotes a kind of whitewashing of your image - turning a belligerent upstart usurper into a righteous avenger of the unjustly murdered lady of his heart.
{cps=50}Despite the fact that you have already decided her fate, the counsellor's question as to what should be done with her next still leaves you lost in thought.
{cps=50}Given the extraordinary scope of the events she has planned, the wedding costs threaten to become a considerable strain on the treasury...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}[storyroll] florins lost!

{cps=50}The end of the civil war allows Alyssa to finally proceed with her plans for marriage.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Irresistibly beautiful and enchantingly elegant, she looks like she stepped out of a brilliant artist's painting.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Her every movement exudes aristocratic grace - the kind that is beyond the reach of mere mortals and makes everyone around look like clumsy yokels.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She looks as if her body has never known fabrics other than silk and metals other than gold.{vspace=5}{w}As if she was born to become a queen.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Her voice is pleasant and melodious.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As she utters these words, she subtly casts a glance over you...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And judging by the movement of the corners of her lips, remains pleased with what she has seen.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And, judging by the lack of reaction, remains unimpressed by what she has seen.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And, judging by the movement of her eyebrows, remains none too pleased with what she has seen.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After exchanging a few more polite formalities, Cassandra informs you that she is very tired from the journey and would like to rest and clean up.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You instruct the servants to escort the girl to her designated chambers.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cassandra replies politely, but her facial expression and cold tone are a dead giveaway.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She's clearly not impressed with what she's seen.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You try to strike up a casual conversation with Cassandra, yet something clearly isn't working out...{vspace=5}Relationship (Cassandra) check failed!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Clearly intrigued by you, Cassandra readily tells you about herself.{vspace=5}Relationship (Cassandra) check passed!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Taking advantage of an auspicious moment, you once again attempt to strike up a casual conversation with Cassandra.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}This time you develop better rapport, and soon the two of you strike up a conversation.{vspace=5}Relationship (Cassandra) check passed!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}In stark contrast to your own youth, which was spent in relative poverty and consisted mostly of grueling field work, Cassandra's youth was spent in luxury, and her main occupation was the study of high culture.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Foreign languages, ancient philosophy, court etiquette - she was prepared for political marriage and life at court from the very childhood.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And now, having acquired grace, tact, and manners worthy of the greatest kings and emperors, she could not imagine herself near anyone else.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Having concluded her story, Cassandra starts asking about your own past with interest...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Unashamed of your peasant origin, you tell her about your life before the campaign in France...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}About laborious work in the field, bustling parties in the taverns and the cramped conditions in your father's modest home.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cassandra is not particularly impressed by the story and soon makes it clear that the description of peasant life - even if it is the most picturesque - is of little interest to her.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Eager to prove that your own reading list is not limited to the Bible alone either, you tell Cassandra about your visit to the royal library and your acquaintance with a number of works there.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cassandra is impressed by that. Even though it quickly becomes clear that you have quite different tastes in literature.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The war adventures you've had are more than enough for several exciting sagas. You recall a couple of more interesting stories and try to share them with Cassandra...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You decide to tell the story of the arduous and bloody siege of Cambrai.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}However, instead of admiration and interest, your tales of slain enemies and experienced horrors only cause Cassandra an acute bout of drowsiness.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She's absolutely uninterested in stories of military exploits.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Moreover, your picturesque descriptions of battles, defeated enemies, and the unpleasant realities of war repel her with their brutality and crudeness.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Realizing the situation, you deliberately omit all the bloody and brutal details in your story and instead romanticize war in the most shameless way, making it seem like the most worthy cause in the world.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}All participants of the French campaign - from the greatest lord to the last lousy peasant - become the noblest men and paragons of chivalry in your story. All these gentlemen conduct the war according to strict rules, and such phenomena as looting or pillaging are simply nonexistent.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Romantic Cassandra appears to be deeply moved by your story and confesses that she has never tried to look at war from such a perspective before.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell Cassandra about how you, on the orders of the command, eliminated a high-ranking French military commander - William de Roche.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Expecting to be complimented on your ingenuity and bravery, you are quite surprised when she reacts with barely concealed disgust and declares that murder - especially a covert assassination - is the lowest and most despicable act.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell Cassandra about how you received an order to eliminate a high-ranking French military commander, William De Roche, but at the last moment you refused to kill him, deeming such an act unworthy.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After expressing her deep disgust for murder in general and especially for those acts that carried out covertly, the lass nevertheless pays tribute to your nobleness.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell Cassandra about your friendship with Bartholomew and how you helped him escape with his beloved.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Given the situation, you naturally omit all the 'controversial' details about the usual activities that Bartholomew was involved in, and turn the story of a deserter thief into a beautiful tale of love and friendship.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cassandra appears to be touched to the very core and confesses that this is one of the most beautiful love stories she has heard.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell her about your affair with Eva de Lambert.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The story of your love affair with another lady understandably doesn't win Cassandra's approval.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell her about your affair with Cecilia Grimaldi.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The story of your love affair with another lady understandably doesn't win Cassandra's approval.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The conversation is clearly not going well, and Cassandra retires to her chambers, citing a migraine.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cassandra, clearly pleased by the compliment, lowers her eyes sheepishly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A faint satisfied smile creeps across Cassandra's face for a moment.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You nod and she continues.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cassandra rolls her eyes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cassandra dips her head in a bow.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As soon as the repairs to Cassandra's chambers are complete, you personally invite her to examine the results.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}What she sees makes her absolutely ecstatic.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cassandra smiles abashedly.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell Cassandra about your friendship with Bartholomew and how you helped him escape with his beloved.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Given the situation, you naturally omit all the 'controversial' details about the usual activities that Bartholomew was involved in, and turn the story of a deserter thief into a beautiful tale of love and friendship.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cassandra appears to be touched to the very core and confesses that this is one of the most beautiful love stories she has heard.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cassandra) improved by [storyroll]!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell her about your affair with Eva de Lambert.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cassandra) lowered by [storyroll]!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The war adventures you've had are more than enough for several exciting sagas. You recall a couple of more interesting stories and decide to tell the story of the arduous and bloody siege of Cambrai.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Realizing the situation, you deliberately omit all the bloody and brutal details in your story and instead romanticize war in the most shameless way, making it seem like the most worthy cause in the world.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}All participants of the French campaign - from the greatest lord to the last lousy peasant - become the noblest men and paragons of chivalry in your story.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}All these gentlemen conduct the war according to strict rules, and such phenomena as looting or pillaging are simply nonexistent.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Romantic Cassandra appears to be deeply moved by your story and confesses that she has never tried to look at war from such a perspective before.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check passed!{vspace=5}Relationship (Cassandra) improved by [storyroll]!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}However, instead of admiration and interest, your tales of slain enemies and experienced horrors only cause Cassandra an acute bout of drowsiness.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She's absolutely uninterested in stories of military exploits.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Moreover, your picturesque descriptions of battles, defeated enemies, and the unpleasant realities of war repel her with their brutality and crudeness.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check failed!{vspace=5}Relationship (Cassandra) lowered by [storyroll]!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell Cassandra about the time you helped save wounded soldiers during the siege of Cambrai by obtaining ingredients and preparing medicinal potions on your own.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cassandra appears to be quite impressed with your nobleness and calls what you did a very dignified act.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cassandra) improved by [storyroll]!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You reveal to Cassandra that you are the one behind the creation of a cure for the plague that has struck Hadley and turned the once prosperous land into a wasteland populated by people rotting alive.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cassandra's astonishment is quite literally limitless.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She cannot believe that you are telling the truth for quite a while. You manage to convince her only once you have recounted the recipe of your antidote in detail and explained the principle of its action.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Shocked to the core, she calls you a living ideal of a king who cares for his subjects.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cassandra, clearly pleased by the compliment, lowers her eyes sheepishly.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The conversation is clearly not going well, and Cassandra retires to her chambers, citing a migraine.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item handed over — [ornate_cloak.name!ti].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You've got nothing to discuss with Cassandra at the moment.
{cps=50}He reports that the recent political instability has had a very negative impact on the monarch's residence.
{cps=50}Luxury items and decorations were plundered by irresponsible servants, the ceilings got dilapidated, all the while repairs and renovations have not been carried out for a long time.
{cps=50}As a result, the royal castle, instead of looking majestic and luxurious, starts appearing more and more pathetic with each passing month and makes a much less than favorable impression.
{cps=50}You decide that you'll do just fine without the repairs.
{cps=50}You accept the deal.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[storyroll] florins received.{vspace=5}[kingdom_of_london_prisoners_captured_temp] enemy soldiers released.
{cps=50}The rebels begin the battle confidently and withstand your first blow, but as soon as it is followed by the second and third, Canterbury's army begins to crumble.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Count Canterbury's army is crushed!{vspace=5}Men lost: [player_kingdom_losses]{vspace=5}Captives captured: [kingdom_of_london_prisoners_captured_temp]
{cps=50}Even more so when it involves such a symbolic gesture as traveling to conquered Oxford - the captured stronghold of a vanquished enemy and the very embodiment of the victory of the Kingdom of London - and Alyssa personally - over the most dangerous foe.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You reveal to Cassandra that you are the one behind the creation of a cure for the plague that has struck Hadley and turned the once prosperous land into a wasteland populated by people rotting alive.
{cps=50}He reports that the Archbishop of Canterbury has defected to [storypoints] and has fled from London[storypoints2]
{cps=50}You decide that now is not the time to spend money on such things.
{cps=50}You refuse this idea.
{cps=50}He reports that with the defeat of Count Canterbury and your complete takeover of the lands he once controlled, the question of ownership of those territories has arisen...
{cps=50}Most of the barons and lords who currently own them supported Count Canterbury and fought against the Kingdom of London.
{cps=50}Naturally, they are now desperately seeking forgiveness and are ready to defect to your side along with the remnants of their detachments. However, their true loyalty is rather questionable.
{cps=50}On top of that, the barons and lords from among your own allies are counting on the conquered lands to become their reward.
{cps=50}You can clearly demonstrate that you always pay generously for faithful service by distributing the land allotments among them.
{cps=50}You decide to preserve the original owners' rights to those lands by granting amnesty to former Canterbury supporters.
{cps=50}Such a move allows you to significantly expand the list of your vassals, as well as increase the number of troops.
{cps=50}You decide to declare the land allotments the property of the crown, while sentencing the old owners, who chose the wrong side in this war, to death.
{cps=50}They thank you for ending the bloody civil war and inform you that they wish to enter the English domestic market with their goods, therefore requesting a number of preferences over local merchants to improve commerce.
{cps=50}Recognizing that such a move may cause disapproval among English merchants, the Italians are willing to generously compensate you financially for your assistance.
{cps=50}Moreover, they also offer to put you in touch with several large Milanese and Genoese condottieri companies, whose assistance would strengthen your army many times over.
{cps=50}You refuse to grant them any preferences.
{cps=50}He bemoans the mutual animosity that has developed between you and the nobles and informs you that he may have found a way to solve the problem.
{cps=50}He suggests that you make extensive concessions to the barons and lords and completely exempt them from paying taxes.
{cps=50}This, of course, will deal a blow to the treasury, but it will allow you to buy the loyalty of the estate which is key to running the state.
{cps=50}You refuse the offer.
{cps=50}They say that they represent the interests of a large alliance of Flemish manufactories involved in the production of ribault cannons.
{cps=50}They offer you to purchase a large shipment of artillery pieces.
{cps=50}He suggests that you outsource some of your military orders to independent craftsmen and manufacturers, allowing you to increase the volume and speed of production.
{cps=50}One of the barons who owns land in the vicinity of Bristol requests your audience.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Popularity (nobility) check passed!
{cps=50}He informs you that his family regularly does business with the Irish traders and is therefore very much aware of the state of affairs on the island.
{cps=50}For instance, he says, the inhabitants of Southern Ireland have been suffering for a long time from hunger caused by a series of crop failures and are so desperate that they are ready to grasp at any straws.
{cps=50}He suggests that you send recruiters to the island, who would promise the Irish a small but steady pay and provide you with an influx of new soldiers.
{cps=50}You refuse.
{cps=50}He proposes to make a series of free bread distributions to the poor in London and other cities to gain the support of the common folk.
{cps=50}You refuse this idea.
{cps=50}He suggests to pay out bonuses to the nobles fighting on your side in the civil war for their service.
{cps=50}This, in his opinion, will raise your popularity among the nobility.
{cps=50}You refuse this idea.
{cps=50}Citing the small size of your army, they suggest taking drastic measures and enlisting London's city guards in military campaigns.
{cps=50}You agree and, to the delight of bandits and troublemakers, withdraw most of the guards patrolling and protecting the capital's streets.
{cps=50}You refuse this idea.
{cps=50}He requests funding to expand his staff of agents and informants.
{cps=50}That, he says, would allow for better control of the situation in the kingdom.
{cps=50}You refuse this idea.
{cps=50}He reports the need for funds to cover all sorts of relevant expenditures of the kingdom's administrative apparatus.
{cps=50}They complain about problems with the army's numbers that impede the efficiency of the war effort against the kingdom's enemies and come forward with a bold initiative...
{cps=50}To grant pardons to criminals serving sentences in prisons throughout the kingdom, in exchange for their consent to join your forces and serve until the war is over.
{cps=50}You agree and, despite the resentment and exasperation of many people, both within the kingdom's government and among the common folk, you free prisoners who are willing to fight for you.

{cps=50}You fall in battle while defending the gates of the royal residence with few loyal men, and Alyssa takes poison in her bedroom while watching from a window as enemy flags are raised one by one on the fortress walls.
{cps=50}The newly created Kingdom of London disappears from the face of the earth as a misunderstanding, the memory of which will not even be preserved in annals and treatises.
{cps=50}You and your men face the enemy on the walls.
{cps=50}However, there is nowhere for you to retreat, for the outcome of this battle will determine the fate of the entire Kingdom of London...
{cps=50}Sensing that continuation of the battle would threaten to turn a heavy defeat into a full-blown disaster, you order a retreat.
{cps=50}The count's battered troops do not dare to give chase, and so you safely retreat back to the Kingdom of London.
{cps=50}Having already exchanged unsuccessful offensives on each other's lands, none of you consider ambitious military campaigns anymore, and the intensity of the confrontation begins to wane.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Having gotten used to being the strongest warrior in any fight during his long military career, Ruffin was firmly convinced that dodging a bolt at such a distance shouldn't be possible.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}If only because he himself wouldn't have been able to do it.
{cps=50}Among others, you also notice Alyssa on the ground - pierced by many bolts and bleeding.

{cps=50}After successfully capturing the coastal fortress, you get the opportunity to put your troops ashore and finally start preparing the siege of Tunis itself.
{cps=50}The city's garrison, according to scouts, numbers about 2,000 warriors, and its defense is mainly organized around two bastions - the western and eastern. Once they fall, the fate of the city will be sealed.

{cps=50}Especially in those cases when the enemy is clad in decent armor or is covering behind a shield — like a timid lass hiding behind a dress.
{cps=50}A good axeman cannot be stopped by things like that. A couple of good swings can shatter any shield.
{cps=50}Another solid option is some kind of club or mace — but then again, everything depends on your strength. If you're packing some serious muscle, then your strikes will be dropping people like sacks of shit.
{cps=50}Mace-like weapons are also very good at draining your enemies' stamina, by the way. You know what they say:{vspace=5}{i}One in the liver, then one to the dome{vspace=5}Bad guy is dead, we're going home!
{cps=50}But all of this only applies if you can actually lift. If you're so unfamiliar with the gym that you call it 'James' — then, yeah, forget axes and maces. Go for something lighter.
{cps=50}But the best option is spears, hands down. They are perfect for keeping the enemy at a comfortable distance and are easy to feint with — all while slowly making Swiss cheese out of him with swift pokes.
{cps=50}A poke here and a stab there. A couple of words about his mom and a brief mention of his sister. Hurt your enemy both physically and mentally — and victory's just around the corner.

{cps=50}Hearing this, the commander of the guard once again expresses admiration for your actions and, as a sign of gratitude for your help, offers you his shield.
{cps=50}You can get detailed information about various available strikes and their properties by hovering over their respective icons.
{cps=50}When selecting a body part to attack, hovering over the dice symbols will give you detailed information about potential damage as well as any additional effects of your strike.
{cps=50}The accuracy of the main weapon's attack depends on several parameters of the attacker and the defender: Agility, Weapon Skill, Weapon Length, and Fatigue level.{vspace=5}Please note that Agility plays a bigger role in defense, while Weapon Skill — in offense.
{cps=50}You can drop your shield at any point during battle. You will be able to retrieve it after the combat, during the looting phase.
{cps=50}Another element that influences the hit probability is the current amount of Stamina of the defending party. The higher it is, the greater their chance to dodge an attack.{vspace=5}This only applies to the defending party. The attacker's Stamina amount does not influence the hit probability.
{cps=50}Feint.{vspace=5}This button allows you to execute a feint with your main weapon.
{cps=50}A feint is a deceptive move that distracts your opponent, draining some of their Stamina and applying an accuracy debuff that lasts for 1 turn.
{cps=50}A successful feint depends on your character's parameters. However, there are several types of feints — all of which operate in different ways and prioritize different stats. You can read more about them in their descriptions.
{cps=50}A successful shield bash can stun the enemy, making them skip their next turn while also massively decreasing their evasion — making them an easy target. Stunned characters are unable to block incoming attacks with their shield.
{cps=50}Shooting works a little bit differently from melee attacks. Hit chance depends on your character's crossbow skill and is increased by the target's Fatigue level. No other stats or parameters influence the outcome of the crossbow shot.
{cps=50}Different types of bolts perform best against different targets. A crossbow loaded with a certain type of bolt can be freely reloaded with another type at any time.{vspace=5}Some of the bolts shot during combat can be picked back up during the looting phase.
{cps=50}Offensive Stance gives you an additional hit chance bonus in melee combat but lowers your defensive capabilities (both the dodge chance and the shield block chance).{vspace=5}The bonus that this stance provides increases with your Weapon Skill.{vspace=5} This stance also makes you susceptible to enemy feints.
{cps=50}Defensive Stance works in the opposite way. It increases your defensive capabilities (both the dodge chance and the shield block chance) but lowers your hit chance.{vspace=5}The evasion bonus that it provides scales with your Agility, but the shield block chance always remains a flat value.{vspace=5}Compared to Offensive Stance, this stance provides slightly higher resistance to enemy feints.
{cps=50}Balanced Stance acts as a middle ground between the two. It gives no attack or defense bonuses but also applies no penalties of any kind.{vspace=5}This stance offers the best protection against enemy feints.
{cps=50}Items.{vspace=5}This button brings up a list of items that can be used. These items can be bandages, antidotes, flasks, alcohol, etc.
{cps=50}Respite.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for lowering your Fatigue level in battle. The general principles of Respite are similar to those of Recover, and the amount of recovered Fatigue also depends on your Coordination.
{cps=50}In the center of the bottom panel is an icon with the image of your main character. It is surrounded by nine squares that depict the armor items that you have equipped. Clicking any of them will bring up a window with detailed information.
{cps=50}Also, directly above the image of your main character is an image of a shield (if you have one). Hovering over the image will provide you with information about its durability.
{cps=50}The 'Character' button will bring up a menu with all of your stats, injuries, and active effects.
{cps=50}Injuries and active effects will also be displayed in the lower panel, above the health and stamina bars.
{cps=50}Injuries.{vspace=5}You and your opponent can attack each other's body parts. Each body part has different damage multipliers, different armor value and armor coverage (depending on the items worn), as well as different injuries associated with them.
{cps=50}For example, successful strikes to the limbs may result in a broken leg or damaged arm muscles, which lower Agility or Weapon Skill, respectively.
{cps=50}The extent of the adverse effects caused by an injury depends on the attacker's Strength level.
{cps=50}Please note that most injuries inflicted on the player will be permanent until they are healed in the camp.
{cps=50}Social aspect of battles.{vspace=5}In many battles you will be fighting side by side with various allies who will be paying attention to your behavior.
{cps=50}These ordinary soldiers are for the most part very blunt, straightforward, and unsophisticated men who aren't big on tactics and strategies, but pay great respect to courage and valor.{vspace=5}Passiveness in combat and excessive feinting will be frowned upon by your comrades. Aggression, on the other hand, will earn you their respect.
{cps=50}This does not imply that there are 'right' and 'wrong' ways of conducting yourself in combat. That decision is solely yours to make — you make the choices and you suffer the consequences.
{cps=50}This about sums it up.{vspace=5}Don't forget that your main task is to survive... and good luck in battle!
{cps=50}The monks turn out to be rather friendly and, wishing to show their gratitude for your martial service, present you with a bottle of wine from the monastery's cellars.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue — success!
{cps=50}After thanking them for their generosity, you get back on your way.
{cps=50}Your arrival sparks no interest in the monks, and they suggest you get back on your way.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue — indecisive!
{cps=50}After taking a look around, you continue your journey.
{cps=50}Instead of greeting you as a righteous defender of the English lands, the monks mistake you for a local bandit and waste no time unleashing the dogs on you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue — fail!
{cps=50}You successfully escape, albeit one of them still manages to sink its teeth into your leg, causing it to bleed heavily.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Bleeding!
{cps=50}Although the bleeding subsides relatively quickly, the encounter has markedly changed your perception of monks and dogs — for the worse.
{cps=50}Limping and cursing, you press on with your journey.
{cps=50}The stranger introduces himself as a blacksmith from one of the local villages and says that he's only recently found out about the ongoing Scottish invasion. He's now hurrying towards York with the weapons and military equipment that were in his forge — hoping to be of aid to the defenders of the city.
{cps=50}After learning that you are also one of the defenders of York, the blacksmith instantly warms up to you and offers to sell you any of his goods.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue, Luck — success!
{cps=50}When you ask why he insists on selling the much-needed equipment rather than handing it over for free, he simply claims that if the city does indeed come under siege, he may be forced to live there for an extended period. Therefore, despite his support for the cause, earning a few extra florins will definitely do him no harm.
{cps=50}After saying your goodbyes to the blacksmith, you get back on your way.
{cps=50}He thanks you for understanding as you both head your separate ways.
{cps=50}You find the story he tells rather suspicious, as there's not a living soul for many miles around who isn't aware of the ongoing war.
{cps=50}Deciding to take the matters into your own hands, you take the man under arrest. His protests quickly give way to resignation as you threaten him with your weapon.
{cps=50}As you approach the city walls and see guards patrolling its perimeter, the stranger suddenly jumps down from the wagon and tries to flee — instantly confirming your suspicions.
{cps=50}He's easily caught, and, after the wagon is searched, the found 'equipment' that he took to York ends up being useless rusty junk that barely holds together.
{cps=50}The 'blacksmith' himself turns out to be in possession of a peculiar dagger that the veteran soldiers instantly identify as a common Scottish weapon.
{cps=50}At first, the man tries to deny everything. Under torture, however, he instantly confesses that he is indeed a Scottish agent, who was sent to York to spy and create diversions in an effort to hinder the city's defense.
{cps=50}It doesn't take long for this news to spread around. Very soon, everyone hails you as a vigilant hero. You're also rewarded with a nice sum of money.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) increased by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!{vspace=5}Prestige increased by 1!{vspace=5}100 florins received!
{cps=50}When you eventually bring him to the camp and thoroughly search his wagon, it turns out that the man didn't lie. The wagon is indeed full of various military equipment — not the best but definitely much needed at this time.
{cps=50}Having found nothing suspicious and only wasted a lot of time, you return to your expedition in the woods.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost — 5!
{cps=50}Wishing to take a proper look around the place, you come closer and then are greeted by the farm's owner.
{cps=50}Wasting no time, the man starts telling you about his woes, claiming that he's nearly out of business as the Scottish invasion and roaming gangs of marauders caused all of his workers to flee in fear, leaving a large crop of beetroots unharvested.
{cps=50}Now he's in desperate need of any working hands that would be willing to help him — for a proper reward, of course.
{cps=50}You agree to lend the man a hand and spend the next several hours working the fields.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time spent — 3!{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}You call it a day when dusk approaches and a hefty amount of crops is harvested. The farmer thanks you and gives you the promised reward.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}50 florins received.
{cps=50}Pocketing the money, you say your goodbyes and get back on your way.
{cps=50}The idea of spending the whole day working in the fields does not really sound appealing; you refuse the offer and get back on your way. The farmer is visibly very irritated by your response but does not dare to do anything about it.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!
{cps=50}The idea of spending the whole day working in the fields does not really sound appealing; you refuse the offer and get back on your way.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — fail!
{cps=50}But before you can do that, the farmer — who was all friendly and fawning a second ago — changes into a completely different man. And, with anger in his voice, he declares that one who refuses to work voluntarily will be persuaded to do so by force.
{cps=50}Right on cue, two stocky-looking guys emerge from right around a nearby barn and, rolling up their sleeves, start heading towards you.
{cps=50}But you're no stranger to danger. As a fight breaks out, you drop both of them, making them fall in the dirt like burlap sacks with beetroot.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength, Agility — success!
{cps=50}Loudly yelling highly creative insults about the farmer, his mother, his men and, of course, the beetroots, you hastily get away from the sinister farm and return to your journey.
{cps=50}You try to fight them off, but the ensuing brawl ends with you on the ground...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength, Agility — fail!
{cps=50}...and all of a sudden you've got no choice but to turn from a soldier to a beetroot-collecting peasant for several hours.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time spent — 3!{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}Luckily for you, the farmer lets you go after all of the crops have eventually been collected.
{cps=50}There's a high chance that the villagers were terrified by the news of the approaching Scots and decided to seek shelter in the city or one of the surrounding monasteries.
{cps=50}Maybe there's something of value still left around...
{cps=50}After pocketing everything worth taking you get back on your way.
{cps=50}While wandering around the woods, you don't notice thick fog shrouding the surroundings.
{cps=50}After becoming lost and disoriented, you have no idea which direction to go, leaving you with no choice but to rely on chance.
{cps=50}Luck turns out to be on your side, and, after having blindly wandered around for some time, you manage to get out of the woods. The whole incident has even made you a little bit better at orienteering.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Luck — success!{vspace=5}Coordination increased by 1!
{cps=50}But Lady Luck turns her back on you. Only after several long hours of blind wandering around did you finally manage to find your way out of the woods.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Luck — fail!{vspace=5}Time spent — 3!{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}Understanding that wandering around blindly is unlikely to be fruitful, you decide to simply sit and wait for the fog to go away.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time spent — 3!
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}After a while the fog starts to dissipate, allowing you to safely make your way back.
{cps=50}On the road back you run into a small band of Scottish soldiers — most likely scouts who were sent towards the English camp to conduct some kind of reconnaissance.
{cps=50}You spot them only a couple of seconds before they see you.
{cps=50}Realizing that there's no time to hide, you decide that offense is the best defense. You immediately attack them, hoping to take the enemy by surprise.
{cps=50}Realizing that there's no way you can fight off several enemies alone, you decide to flee.
{cps=50}And successfully manage to do it.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance, Luck — success!
{cps=50}The Scots try to catch you but to no avail. They quickly give up the chase, unwilling to draw nearer to English positions.
{cps=50}But they do hurl several highly unpleasant insults your way.
{cps=50}But you fail to do it.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance, Luck — fail!
{cps=50}The Scots quickly catch up to you, forcing you to fight for your life.
{cps=50}Making your way back, you suddenly find yourself right in the middle of some sort of hunting grounds...
{cps=50}...and only sheer luck saves you from stepping into a huge bear trap that could easily tear your leg off.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Luck, Coordination — success!
{cps=50}...and clumsily step into an animal trap that seriously wounds your leg.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Luck, Coordination — fail!{vspace=5}Vitality lowered by 1!
{cps=50}Intimidated by your ferocity, enemies seemingly start having second thoughts about their decision to fight you.

Welcome to the war!
Very soon you will have to shed your first blood, but before you do this, it would be wise to get acquainted with the main principles of Heads Will Roll's combat system.
Let's take a closer look at what exactly you can do.
Detailed information about various strikes and their properties can be viewed by hovering over their respective icons.
Please note that different weapons have different attacks. Attacks vary not only between weapon classes but sometimes also within the classes themselves.
When selecting a body part to attack, hovering over the dice symbols will give you detailed information about the potential damage as well as any additional effects of your strike.
The accuracy of the main weapon's attack depends on several parameters of the attacker and the defender: Agility, Weapon Skill, Weapon Length and Fatigue level.{vspace=5}Please note that Agility plays a bigger role in defense, while Weapon Skill — in offense.
A character holding a shield possesses an additional layer of defense. During an attack, the game will first determine whether the attacker has managed to hit the target at all, then whether the blow was blocked by the shield, and lastly, whether the blow hit a body part protected (or not) by armor. The chance to block a blow with a shield is contingent upon its characteristics.
Another element that influences the hit probability is the current amount of Stamina of the defending party. The higher it is, the higher the chance to dodge an attack.{vspace=5}This only applies to the defending party. The attacker's Stamina amount does not influence the hit probability.
The success of the feint also depends on the character's parameters. There are several types of feints — all of which operate in different ways and prioritize different stats. You can read more about them in their descriptions.
Shield actions work similarly to feints, but their success primarily depends on the Strength stat of both the attacking and defending characters.
Shooting works a little bit differently from melee attacks. The hit chance solely depends on the character's crossbow skill and is additionally increased by the target's Fatigue level. No other stats or parameters influence the outcome of the crossbow shot.
Different types of bolts perform best against different targets. A crossbow loaded with a certain type of bolt can be freely reloaded with another type at any time.{vspace=5}Some of the bolts shot during combat can be picked back up during the looting phase.
Overall, there are three stances — Offensive Stance, Defensive Stance and Balanced Stance.
Offensive Stance gives you an additional hit chance bonus in melee combat but lowers your defensive capabilities (both the dodge chance and the shield block chance).{vspace=5}The bonus that this stance provides increases with your Weapon Skill.{vspace=5} This stance also makes you susceptible to enemy feints.
Defensive Stance works in the opposite way. It increases your defensive capabilities (both the dodge chance and the shield block chance) but lowers your hit chance.{vspace=5}The evasion bonus that it provides scales with your Agility, but the shield block chance always remains a flat value.{vspace=5}Compared to Offensive Stance, this stance provides slightly higher resistance to enemy feints.
Balanced Stance acts as a middle ground between the two. It gives no attack or defense bonuses but also applies no penalties of any kind.{vspace=5}This stance offers the best protection against enemy feints.
In the center of the bottom panel is an icon with the image of your main character. It is surrounded by nine squares that depict the armor items that you have equipped. Clicking any of them will bring up a window with detailed information.
Please note that most injuries inflicted on the player will be permanent until they are healed in camp.
Social aspect of battles.{vspace=5}In many battles you will be fighting side by side with various allies who will be paying attention to your behavior.
These ordinary soldiers are for the most part very blunt, straightforward, and unsophisticated men who aren't big on tactics and strategies, but pay great respect to courage and valor.{vspace=5}Passiveness in combat and excessive feinting will be frowned upon by your comrades. Aggression, on the other hand, will earn you their respect.
This does not imply that there are 'right' and 'wrong' ways of conducting yourself in combat. That decision is solely yours to make — you make the choices and you suffer the consequences.
All offensive and defensive actions will increase your Fatigue level by an amount equal to the Stamina spent on that action. For example, if you attack an enemy with a strike that costs 10 Stamina, your Fatigue will increase by 10.
There are five levels of Fatigue: 'Fresh', 'Winded', 'Tired', 'On Last Legs', and 'Exhausted'. To progress from one level to the next, you have to deplete one full Stamina bar. The higher your maximum Stamina, the slower your Fatigue progresses.
The first Fatigue level ('Fresh') does not apply any penalties, but the next levels apply increasingly severe ones.{vspace=5}Fatigue penalties lower the accuracy of all your offensive actions as well as your chance to dodge enemy attacks.
Please note that physical exhaustion can easily undermine any advantages that a character might possess in equipment and skills. A man who can barely move his feet will not perform well in combat against fresh opponents.
This sums it up.{vspace=5}Don't forget that your main task is to survive... and good luck in battle!

{cps=50}The joy of the windfall, however, is slightly offset by the realization that it was achieved through the use of lucky dice, which many players feel is tantamount to cheating.

{cps=50}Dancing to the beat, the guards let you into the city.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Trinket, Luck check passed!
{cps=50}As you finish up your song, one of the guards punches you in the face while the others call for help, trying to grab you. You have no choice but to flee through the gates before they can close.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Luck check failed!
{cps=50}Given your inability to play the flute, you instead attempt to talk your way out of the situation, saying that your voice is so captivating that the defenders of the city might involuntarily relax their vigil upon hearing it — a risk that cannot be taken considering the proximity of the English.
{cps=50}The guards are not convinced by your argument and insist on hearing a few good songs.
{cps=50}In a last-ditch attempt to talk your way out, you point out that you can't actually play anything: the flute got wet after the recent rain and hasn't had time to properly dry yet. The flute is in absolutely no condition to be used.
{cps=50}Your lie doesn't sound very convincing, as the last rain was a week and a half ago. Sensing deception, the guards swiftly move to grab you, forcing you to flee through the gates before they can close.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Luck check failed!
{cps=50}Not wanting to mess with the knight, you try to slip away into one of the alleyways. The knight stops you, firmly grabbing your hand.
{cps=50}At that moment, a tarot card slips out of your pocket and falls on the ground — right in front of the knight.
{cps=50}Shocked, the knight freezes in place like a stone statue. After regaining his composure a few seconds later, he crosses himself and hurriedly leaves.{vspace=5}You return to your task.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Trinket check passed!

{cps=50}As the knight menacingly approaches you, you throw your cloak at him, intending to confuse him just long enough to flee.
{cps=50}He immediately gives chase. Fortunately, the alley is littered with barrels and crates, obstructing his movement.

{cps=50}Also, he said, one should always keep one's ear to the ground when dealing with villagers.

{cps=50}In an attempt to somehow brighten up the incredible gloom of everyday life in the siege camp, one of the knights from Count Sunderland's entourage is organizing a fistfighting tournament. Each noble lord will nominate a single champion from their retinue.
{cps=50}Taking into account the distance to cover and the speed of the wind, you realize that a successful shot will require singular skill with a crossbow.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You will need 10 points of crossbow skill to have a chance to hit the target.{vspace=5}You will need 15 points of crossbow skill to guarantee a hit on the target.

{cps=50}{cps=50}The news of your failure causes great dissatisfaction. The earl makes it clear to you that, by failing this crucial mission twice, you have severely eroded his confidence in you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) lowered by 25!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 25!
{cps=50}After careful consideration, you conclude that there are three possible ways to access the basement of the city hall.
{cps=50}The first is to infiltrate from within. According to Jeanne's stories, the lower floors of the city hall are connected to an extensive network of catacombs that can be accessed through the sewers.
{cps=50}The plan seems quite feasible. Unless, of course, one manages to get lost in the underground passages... or worse, stumble upon their inhabitants...
{cps=50}The second option is to blend in. Taking advantage of the darkness, you could attempt to pass as a local and enter the city hall directly through the servants' entrance.
{cps=50}Accessing the inner chambers while dressed in a ragged gambeson would be problematic, however. The elite mercenaries guarding this area would quickly see through your ruse.
{cps=50}And the third method, of course, is a bribe. As they say, money always finds its way...
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}You decide to go forward with a bribe.
{cps=50}Your good reputation and extensive connections allow you to quickly establish contact with one of the soldiers guarding the city hall that night.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) — success!
{cps=50}For 100 florins, he will be willing to let you into the building through a secret passage.
{cps=50}Bartholomew is ready to contribute half of this amount, but you will have to pay the remaining sum.
{cps=50}You are satisfied with this arrangement and pay the soldier the agreed amount.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}50 florins lost.
{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}That night, at the appointed time, a soldier helps you two sneak into the city hall.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}Not willing to part with such an amount, you cannot agree to the arrangement.
{cps=50}You have to go back to planning.
{cps=50}While you have some money to spare, it turns out that currency alone isn't always enough.
{cps=50}For one, you're not well-connected to your peers, so it's unclear to whom you would deliver the money. Moreover, you don't wield much authority among the troops, so the few soldiers you approach simply brush you off.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) — failed!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 2!
{cps=50}You have to go back to planning.
{cps=50}You decide to infiltrate the city hall by posing as a member of Canterbury's entourage.
{cps=50}Without exception, each mercenary comprising the count's retinue was an experienced soldier.
{cps=50}You could tell by the excellent weapons and equipment they were carrying, as well as by their penchant for barbaric luxury.
{cps=50}In other words, they all fit a certain mold — one that would not be easy to replicate. However, you reasoned that the night was just thick enough for you to blend in with them.
{cps=50}The trick works. You manage to slip past most of the guards unnoticed, and the few who do notice you mistake you for one of their own.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Items, Prestige — success!
{cps=50}You successfully infiltrate the city hall.
{cps=50}Upon returning to safety, you resume planning.
{cps=50}You decide to crawl through the sewers.
{cps=50}You're immediately faced with your first obstacle; the sewer entrance, situated on the city outskirts by the wall, is blocked by a heavy iron grate, rusted through from years of exposure to moisture.
{cps=50}It would take considerable physical strength to move the grate even a few inches.
{cps=50}Pooling your efforts, you and Bartholomew succeed in pushing it back and gaining entry.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength — success!
{cps=50}The sewers are a tangled labyrinth of narrow passages, stretching beneath the entirety of the old city. With only a vague idea of where to go, you find yourself wading through knee-deep water and mud for several hours.
{cps=50}Your teeth begin to chatter from the cold, and breathing becomes difficult due to the stench.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality lowered by 1!{vspace=5}Toxicity increased!
{cps=50}Bartholomew eventually manages to chart a course, following Jeanne's instructions. Fifteen minutes later, you reach one of the city hall's kitchens through a food waste chute.
{cps=50}You and Bartholomew try your best to push the sewer grate ajar, but to no avail.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength — fail!
{cps=50}Breaking into the sewers is now out of the question, and you have to go back to planning.
{cps=50}Extremely dissatisfied with you, Bartholomew refuses your further assistance and says that he will do everything himself.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Once inside, you start looking for a way down to the dungeons, where the prisoners are likely kept.
{cps=50}During your search, you sneak past a spacious and dimly lit dining hall. Through the flickering candlelight, you notice half a dozen men huddled around a table and quietly conversing among themselves.
{cps=50}You recognize one of the voices right away.
{cps=50}Ruffin.
{cps=50}The voices don't ring any bells to you.
{cps=50}You catch one of the speakers being addressed by name.
{cps=50}Ruffin.
{cps=50}This campaign is nearing its end, brothers.
{cps=50}The king's ambitions proved too much for him and he bit off more than he could chew — not surprising considering whom he chose as his right-hand man.
{cps=50}Old man Northampton hasn't learnt a single thing since Scotland. The only thing he knows is to bang his head against the wall in the hope that it will crack before his own forehead does.
{cps=50}It's just a miracle that the bastions of Cambrai somehow turned out to be less durable than that empty head of his.
{cps=50}Had this city been defended not by Flemish drunkards, but by real soldiers like you and me, the king, his precious little son, and that senile old fool Northampton would never have even dreamed of taking Cambrai.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ruffin spits on the floor in disgust.
{cps=50}I've seen that war with my own eyes, brother. The earl couldn't win a battle even if his life depended on it.{w}{vspace=5}But what he did instead was to plot his way to victory.
{cps=50}The man's a schemer, and a rather talented one — I'll give him that. When it comes to intrigues, traps, double-crosses, and backstabs, he's unmatched.
{cps=50}But even with all of these tricks he could only force a stalemate. It was Count Canterbury's arrival that finally shifted the balance of power in our favor.
{cps=50}Northampton might have pulled off a few fancy moves, yes, but he definitely wasn't responsible for defeating the Scots.
{cps=50}That's about to change.
{cps=50}The count will show his teeth yet. He has already taught that old fool a lesson in how to wage a war. Soon, he will show him how to weave a web of intrigues.
{cps=50}We're with him until the end of this campaign.{w} Afterwards, if he needs some more help on the continent, then we might lend him a hand one more time, yes. But we're not sailing back to England.
{cps=50}...at least until we settle our main business here.
{cps=50}Yes. It is.{w} I've got one arrogant knight to return a favor to.
{cps=50}Perhaps he might have forgotten about me. But I sure as hell didn't forget him.
{cps=50}Alright, brothers. It's time to rest. We've got a lot of work ahead of us.
{cps=50}I've seen those knights. Nothing to brag about.{w} The tougher the enemy, the bigger the glory.
{cps=50}Bartholomew and you remain hidden in the shadows on the opposite sides of the entrance to the hall, waiting for the conversation to end.
{cps=50}The faint candlelight eventually goes out. One by one, the figures start to leave.
{cps=50}A few seconds after the last of them has disappeared around the corner, you leave cover and resume your search.
{cps=50}Finding the dungeons proves to be difficult. Exhausted from wandering in the dark, both of you are starting to worry.
{cps=50}Emboldened, you descend into the dungeons. Your joy proves to be premature, as you find yourself face to face with two soldiers guarding the prison cells.
{cps=50}The quick-witted Bartholomew immediately tries to drop their guard with a fictitious story. However, they clearly aren't buying it, looking at you with increasing suspicion with each passing second.
{cps=50}Seeing that the situation is taking a turn for the worse, Bartholomew discreetly signals you that the time for drastic measures has come.
{cps=50}Struck by an enemy blow, Bartholomew slowly sinks to the ground. One look at him is enough to realize that he's not going to make it.
{cps=50}You bend down to the dying man to try to make out his last words... to no avail.
{cps=50}Holding your gaze, Bartholomew breathes his last.
{cps=50}With Bartholomew's death, your foray into the city hall has lost its purpose. Thoughts of escaping the area begin to surface.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Concerned with your own survival, you decide to leave Bartholomew's body unrecovered and his murderer unpunished, fleeing the place as fast as possible.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 30!
{cps=50}By some miracle, you manage to make it out alive. But the events of this night would forever torment you, wracking your mind with guilt and regret.
{cps=50}Bartholomew's death completely nullifies the purpose of the operation. Without him, you don't know how to navigate the city hall. What's worse, you won't be able to recognize the prisoner — or know what you're supposed to do with him once he's freed.
{cps=50}There is nothing left for you to do here.
{cps=50}Consoling your conscience with the fact that you have at least managed to avenge the fallen friend, you turn back and escape the city hall the same way you got in.
{cps=50}With both guards dead, Bartholomew stands still for a few seconds, ensuring the altercation hasn't drawn unwanted attention.
{cps=50}Having made sure that the coast is clear, he gives you a nod.
{cps=50}Bartholomew produces a scroll from his pocket, his brow furrowing as he consults it. He then removes a set of keys from the wall and heads towards one of the cells. A metal door creaks, and out steps a man covered in bruises and quaking with fear.
{cps=50}After briefly explaining that you are here to save him, Bartholomew instructs the prisoner to remain silent as all three of you make your way back through the city hall.
{cps=50}Everything goes smoothly. Once back to safety, the rescued man showers you with gratitude.
{cps=50}Bartholomew too seems relieved.
{cps=50}I guess you should.
{cps=50}Neither does mine.{w} But what baffles me even more is that you — I mean, we — did all this to impress a girl.
{cps=50}But whatever. All is well that ends well, right? Go tell her the good news.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}While she's busy celebrating, perhaps you can even steal something else from her... In that case, take something more valuable, eh?
{cps=50}Sounds like you might have a plan.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Wait a second. You aren't going to...
{cps=50}You don't plan to come back, do you?
{cps=50}Damn. Well... I'll be missing you, friend.
{cps=50}Leaving the fortified city, you, along with a small group of men, head towards Onar's farm.
{cps=50}I feel the same way about you!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) Improved by 15!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 10!
{cps=50}With these words, Olivia departs, leaving you alone in the cramped prison cell.
{cps=50}Concealing what has happened from prying eyes proves impossible. Dupont, leading a large detachment of guards and knights, promptly arrives to investigate.
{cps=50}Following Anna's directions, you find several small stone buildings near Onar's farm, where the warehouse should be located.
{cps=50}One of these structures features a built-in observation tower, from which one can survey the entire surrounding area.
{cps=50}You conclude that the best course of action would be to act covertly: get as close as possible under the cloak of twilight and eliminate the guards with poisoned weapons.
{cps=50}You could also launch a frontal attack. The risk would be considerable, however.
{cps=50}You decide to go with the stealthier option.
{cps=50}Camouflaged in a secluded spot nearby, you wait until dusk.
{cps=50}As you prepare to move out, you realize that your covert operation would have a greater chance of success if you removed your armor. The clatter of your gear could give you away.
{cps=50}Unwilling to bother yourself with formulating a plan, you instead choose to attack in the open.
{cps=50}Your plan works spectacularly! You successfully sneak up on the enemies and dispatch them without a sound.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Equipment, Poison, Agility, Coordination - success!
{cps=50}Your attempt to sneak up on the enemies fails. You are spotted and forced to fight.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Equipment, Poison, Agility, Coordination — fail!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Recognizing that the momentum of the battle is shifting in favor of the enemy, you choose to retreat.
{cps=50}The raid ends in failure, and you return empty-handed.
{cps=50}Having eliminated the guards, you gain entrance to the warehouse. The building indeed proves impressive, packed to the brim with alchemical supplies.
{cps=50}Honoring your agreement with Anna, you burn it all to the ground.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}You simply can't resist such an opportunity and opt to take a few items for yourself.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 15!
{cps=50}After setting the warehouse on fire, you quickly take off.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}The mercenaries no longer have access to the alchemical potions.
{cps=50}A messenger informs you that Olivia wants to receive your briefing on the preparations for the assault on Onar's farm.{vspace=5}She is expecting to see you as soon as possible.
{cps=50}Upon arriving at the inn, you follow Olivia's instructions and approach the owner, who directs you to two lodgers dining on the ground floor.
{cps=50}You head towards them straight away, ready for anything. But what you see still catches you off guard.
{cps=50}...and then his wife storms into the room screaming: 'Let him go! Let him go!'
{cps=50}So?
{cps=50}So I go like: 'Sure.'
{cps=50}And I let him go. He goes flying straight off the balcony and plummets about thirty feet to the ground.{w}{vspace=5}Broke every bone in his body.
{cps=50}Jesus Christ.
{cps=50}This might be a little bit too callous.{vspace=5}Even by your own bloodthirsty standards.
{cps=50}Excuse me? You're calling me bloodthirsty?{vspace=5}Last time I checked it wasn't me who burned the trading guild to the ground...
{cps=50}Oh, here we go again.{vspace=5}{w}It was an accident, I told you many times.
{cps=50}And who sunk that Spanish caravel along with its entire crew?
{cps=50}I told them to surrender!
{cps=50}They probably didn't even hear you because of the storm.
{cps=50}What was I supposed to do? Get in a shouting match with the ocean?
{cps=50}Alright, I'll let that one slide.{vspace=5}But who cut the throat of Count Anjou's son?
{cps=50}Little rascal had a dagger.
{cps=50}Did his daughter have one too?
{cps=50}She was about to call the guards.
{cps=50}You are a monster, Grace.
{cps=50}Maybe. But I'm the only one willing to work with you.{vspace=5}{w}Wonder what that says about you?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Caught in the heat of their argument, neither of them acknowledges your presence.
{cps=50}Uhm, ladies...
{cps=50}They both turn to you.
{cps=50}The following moments feel like an eternity as they scrutinize you from head to toe.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}We don't do charity, boy.
{cps=50}If you're after the leftovers from the table, then you can at least wait until we're gone.
{cps=50}And if you expect to get some wine — then forget it. My friend's an alcoholic. She won't leave a drop.
{cps=50}What the hell, Grace?
{cps=50}What the hell what? You've been boozing so much that your hands are shaking — can't hit a damn thing with that crossbow of yours in this state.
{cps=50}If it weren't for that contraption the Venetians had made for you, your shooting would be absolutely useless.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Her partner opens her mouth to retaliate, but you manage to beat her to it.
{cps=50}Who are you?{vspace=5}I am sent here by the Duchess Olivia de Montfort to inquire about your occupation and the nature of your business in these lands.
{cps=50}Well, one could say that we're doing the dirty work for those who want to keep their hands clean.
{cps=50}What's that supposed to mean?
{cps=50}We are paid to find people and deliver them to our employer.{vspace=5}{w}Usually alive.
{cps=50}But lately there's been... A spike of mortality in our line of work. Let's put it that way.
{cps=50}Uh-huh.{vspace=5}{w}I can't wrap my head around why...
{cps=50}So you're bounty hunters? Who is your target?
{cps=50}You know perfectly well who it is.
{cps=50}Olivia de Monfort?
{cps=50}That's right. The young Duchess.
{cps=50}I have sworn to protect her with my own life. And this is exactly what I intend to do.
{cps=50}Which brings us back to you.{vspace=5}So far I haven't heard a single reason as to why my men and I shouldn't execute the two of you on the spot.
{cps=50}You asked us about our target, but forgot to ask about something else which is just as important.{vspace=5}{w}Who's the employer.
{cps=50}And that would be?
{cps=50}The bounty on Olivia de Monfort's head was placed by Avignon.{vspace=5}{w}Our young Duchess caught the attention of the Inquisition.
{cps=50}And nobody is dumb enough to stand in their way, right?{vspace=5}I get it — loyalty and all — but those guys at Avignon really don't seem to suffer from a shortage of stakes to burn people at.
{cps=50}And we don't have a shortage of steel either — so you might not even make it to Avignon.{vspace=5}{w}Makes no difference to us, really.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Well, here's our proposition. Since the duchess herself sent you, you must be, presumably, not an insignificant nobody in Rennes. Perhaps far from that.
{cps=50}So how about you help us capture and smuggle her out of the city? We, in turn, will guarantee that expressions like 'burned at the stake' and 'wanted by the Inquisition' will not be mentioned in your biography.{vspace=5}If, of course, someone ever gets to write one. Which we will not guarantee.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}And...? {w}That's it?
{cps=50}How is 'not being burned alive' still not enough? What kind of person are you?
{cps=50}Well, I'm afraid we don't really have anything else to add to our end of the bargain.{w} Other than a couple of crossbow bolts.{vspace=5}{w}But this might end up being a deal you'd wish you never struck.
{cps=50}My loyalty to the Duchess is not for sale.
{cps=50}As you wish.{vspace=5}{w}A couple of crossbow bolts it is then.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Having dealt with the bounty hunters, you return to Olivia.
{cps=50}Oh, Lord! I've been so worried!{vspace=5}Thank God you're alright.
{cps=50}It's done, milady. Those two are gone forever.
{cps=50}I always knew I could count on you.{vspace=5}I'm surrounded by enemies, but somehow you're saving me again and again.
{cps=50}This is for you. You've earned every coin.{vspace=5}1000 florins received!
{cps=50}Now the treasury is officially empty. But to hell with it — who else on earth am I supposed to pay if not you!
{cps=50}There's only one thing left to do now: strike the rebels right at their heart and finally put an end to all this.{vspace=5}Move out as soon as you and your men are ready.
{cps=50}As usual, I expect you to return victorious.
{cps=50}Having bid farewell to Olivia, you suddenly recall the words of one of the bounty hunters: that the Inquisition had issued a contract to capture the duchess.
{cps=50}These two weren't ordinary assassins sent by ill-wishers or one of the rebels. The story seems to be more complicated.
{cps=50}As you replay her words in your mind, you wonder whether you should have asked Olivia herself about this...
{cps=50}Your questions cannot wait. You decide to go back to talk to Olivia.
{cps=50}Upon entering her quarters, you notice that she has left.
{cps=50}Thinking it over again, you decide that it's just nonsense not worth dwelling on, and you turn back.
{cps=50}Alone in her quarters, an inexplicable urge overtakes you, compelling you to look around.
{cps=50}The duchess' private quarters consist of a series of interconnected rooms. From the spacious study, which seemingly once belonged to Duke de Montfort, you enter a smaller bedroom.
{cps=50}At first glance, everything appears perfectly ordinary. However, out of the corner of your eye, you catch sight of a partially concealed door on the other side of the room.
{cps=50}As you approach the door, you notice it opens onto a dimly lit corridor, its stairs descending into the darkness ahead.
{cps=50}Thinking it over again, you decide to mind your own business and turn back.
{cps=50}Step by step, you gingerly go down the stairs.
{cps=50}Lower and lower.
{cps=50}At some point, the steps lead to a flat surface.
{cps=50}After your sight adjusts to the darkness, you discern some kind of altar in front of you.
{cps=50}What you see next is beyond description.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Shaken by what you've witnessed, you intend to demand answers from her immediately.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As you take a step towards her, you hear a rustle behind you. A monstrous blow lands on the back of your head, rippling through your entire body and leaving you unconscious.
{cps=50}Struggling to stay on your feet and still not entirely comprehending what is unfolding before your eyes, you decide to retreat and pretend that nothing had happened.
{cps=50}After reconsidering everything once more, you decide that it's simply nonsense not worth dwelling on.
{cps=50}While your pay remains intact, the wages of the lower-ranking members of your squad have been halved, as decreed by the city treasurer.
{cps=50}While staying at the de Châtillon estate, you receive news that the local lords are hosting a series of tournaments in which noble warriors are invited to partake.
{cps=50}Rich rewards are promised to the winners.
{cps=50}You arrive at the tournament venue.
{cps=50}Although you are not knighted, the quality of your equipment leaves no doubt that you truly belong to the noble class.
{cps=50}You are allowed to participate in the tournament under the moniker 'Mysterious Knight'.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Poisoned weapons are not allowed in the tournament.{vspace=5}After all, it's not a contest to the death.
{cps=50}Not only are you not knighted, but the quality of your equipment makes it abundantly clear that you are a cut below the other contestants.{vspace=5}You're not allowed to participate in the tournament.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — fail (required: 70)!
{cps=50}During the battle, the masters of ceremonies notice poison on your weapon. This is a gross violation of the rules, which leads to your immediate disqualification.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige lowered by 20!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 25!
{cps=50}You are also forced to pay a fine.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}100 florins lost!
{cps=50}Defeated, you withdraw from the tournament.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You win in a spectacular fashion!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige increased by 5!{vspace=5}400 florins received!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You are allowed to choose one of three rewards.
{cps=50}Now officially out of patience, the organizers declare the battle a draw.
{cps=50}Following Emma's advice, you find St. Lazarus Hospital. It turns out to be an old and decrepit fort repurposed into a medical facility for treating wounded and ill soldiers.
{cps=50}You're unable to enter right away; according to the physicians, an epidemic has broken out among the patients. Outside contact has been reduced to zero.
{cps=50}The physicians acknowledge their uncertainty regarding the timeline for eliminating the epidemic, citing a medicine shortage.
{cps=50}Not being one to wait around, you manage to bribe one of the workers to let you in.
{cps=50}But, alas, to your disappointment, you find no trace of Renauld de Châtillon among the patients.
{cps=50}And as they say, trouble often comes in pairs. After visiting the hospital and exposing yourself to its patients, you start to feel unwell too.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Toxicity increased!{vspace=5}Vitality lowered by 1!
{cps=50}Thanks to your help, the situation in the hospital begins to improve. Before long, the contagion is brought under control.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 25!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 25!
{cps=50}But, to your disappointment, you find no trace of Renauld de Châtillon among the patients.
{cps=50}The sole consolation lies in the fact that some of the soldiers, grateful for your assistance with the medicine, express interest in joining you on your quests.

{cps=50}You hand him the required sum and collect the jewelry.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}500 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}On your way back from Faraskur, you are accosted by a gang of bandits. They demand 300 florins as payment for safe passage to the city.
{cps=50}Not wanting to gamble with your life, you decide to pay them off.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}500 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!

{cps=50}Intimidated by your ferocity, the bandits start having second thoughts about their decision to mess with you.

{cps=50}Despite the relatively short distance between Faraskur and Damietta, the scorching sun and hot air make the trip a true ordeal.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue increased by [player_stamina_max]!
{cps=50}As soon as you reach the outskirts of Faraskur, you are immediately attacked by a small group of Arab horsemen.
{cps=50}Having dealt with the light cavalry, you prepare to attack the city itself — currently under the control of an infantry detachment.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Realizing that the odds are not in their favor, the light cavalry retreats to the city — currently under the control of an infantry detachment.
{cps=50}You regroup and prepare for an assault on the city.

{cps=50}The enemy is clearly not intending to make a last stand. As soon as the tide of battle turns in your favor, the Saracens retreat.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] fatigue!
{cps=50}After ensuring that Faraskur is under no immediate threat, you return to Damietta to report to the governor.
{cps=50}Pleased with your success in Faraskur, the governor says that he has good news to share as well. The name 'Renauld de Châtillon' does appear in the list of crusader warriors who have arrived in Damietta.
{cps=50}However, the most recent mention of him dates back a year ago. Subsequent records of him could not be found.
{cps=50}Seeing your puzzled look, the governor pauses and, after taking a moment to reflect, declares that it's too early to give up. There is supposedly another place that might contain information about Renauld.
{cps=50}West of Damietta lies the Fortress of Ezbert, a stronghold that has served as a headquarters for knights for a quarter of a century. Count de Mollet and his retinue have been known to frequent this place, making it an ideal location to resume the search for Renauld.
{cps=50}According to the governor, the fortress is currently being held by rebel knights. His own men are laying siege to it, but he could certainly use some assistance to expedite his victory.
{cps=50}Seeing that your interests coincide, you agree to help his men with the siege of Ezbert.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [knightfall.name!ti].
{cps=50}The road to Ezbert turns out to be extremely exhausting.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue increased by [player_stamina_max]!
{cps=50}About halfway there, you decide to take a breather in the shade of a rare patch of vegetation.
{cps=50}Just as you let your guard down, a venomous snake appears seemingly out of nowhere and bites you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Toxicity increased!
{cps=50}With some difficulty, you eventually reach the besieged Fortress of Ezbert. While it is well defended, you assess that it is certainly not impregnable.
{cps=50}Despite your arrival, the governor's men show no urgency in storming the fortress, seeming to prefer a battle of attrition.
{cps=50}They claim that the besieged rebel knights have been suffering from food and water shortages. Crusaders' surrender should be just around the corner.
{cps=50}The prospect of being drawn into another prolonged siege doesn't sit well with you. Yet, it's painfully obvious that these men have a point; your own military experience attests to it.
{cps=50}You immediately recall a saying your old sergeant used to repeat during the days of the Cambrai campaign:{vspace=5}{i}'The only thing worse than besieging a fortress is taking it by force.'{/i}{vspace=5}Or, as he also used to say:{vspace=5}{i}'If your brain is worthless, go storm a fortress.'{/i}
{cps=50}You acknowledge their logic. Yet, you can't spare the time for a prolonged siege. You order an immediate assault.
{cps=50}Governor's men reluctantly agree, but only if it's you and your men who will lead the attack.
{cps=50}You've got no choice, and, after a couple of hours' preparation, you — just like in the good old days — charge the fortress' walls with a siege ladder in your hands...
{cps=50}Loss of time concerns you far less than the prospect of perishing in a poorly planned assault. You agree to continue the siege.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time left: 5!
{cps=50}Over the next week, as the garrison at Ezbert continues to weaken, you are carefully planning for the assault. You make a point to avoid the blunders you've witnessed at Cambrai.
{cps=50}Wasting no time, you launch the assault the moment you are content with your preparations.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}After capturing the walls, you break into the fortress itself...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Driven by adrenaline, the battle has passed in a blur for you. It's only after the cessation of hostilities that the true outcome of your actions becomes clear.
{cps=50}Under the feet of the jubilant victors lie the bloodied corpses of Christian Europeans — killed, among others, by your hand.
{cps=50}The last thing you thought would happen when setting off to Outremer was to participate in yet another bloody internecine conflict between fellow believers. Fate, however, seemed to have willed it as such.
{cps=50}As you dwell on these somber thoughts, the governor's men are already smashing down the doors guarding the underground vault, where the treasures of the Order await.
{cps=50}Deciding that the documents can wait, you join in the looting of the fortress.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue reduced by 15!{vspace=5}Time lost: 3!
{cps=50}Your thirst for gold quenched, you turn to what you came here for: searching for the documents.
{cps=50}You decide to do what you came here for: searching for the documents.
{cps=50}Having loaded the numerous archives of the Order onto wagons, you prepare to transport them back to the governor in Damietta.
{cps=50}As you're about to leave, you notice that the bodies of the slaughtered knights are being dumped in a disorderly heap — ready to be incinerated.
{cps=50}Such disrespect for dead fellow believers offends you. You decide to honor their deaths by burying them yourself.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!{vspace=5}Time lost: 2!
{cps=50}The road back is uneventful.
{cps=50}Grateful for your help, the governor promises that his subordinates will promptly study the documents to uncover any trace of Renauld de Châtillon.
{cps=50}You express your dissatisfaction to him for what has happened at Ezbert, but the governor flatly states that he merely maintains law and order in these lands.
{cps=50}Having found the bard in one of the city's establishments, you wait for him to start performing.
{cps=50}Recognizing veiled insults aimed at the governor within his song, you interrupt his performance and demand that he apologizes — or else.
{cps=50}The Italian, who has found himself in similar situations before, readily accepts your challenge.
{cps=50}The Italian turns out to be more skilled than expected and proves to be a difficult opponent. Exhausted, both of you agree to a draw.
{cps=50}The duel naturally ends with your victory. Overjoyed by the news, the governor generously rewards you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}50 florins received!
{cps=50}The governor is disappointed by the mission's failure and remarks — with good reason — that he may have to send assassins after the bard.
{cps=50}With the aid of the governor's scouts and spies, you learn that Beibars resides in his fiefdom in Mit Sharaf, a town situated southeast of Faraskur.
{cps=50}After observing the surroundings, you conclude that Mit Sharaf is well guarded; your only chance would be to quickly penetrate the city, capture Beibars, and immediately make a getaway without getting involved in a prolonged battle.
{cps=50}Not wanting to miss the opportunity, you decide to take a chance...
{cps=50}Your plan proves to be subpar, resulting in the mission's failure as Beibars remains at large.
{cps=50}While you're fumbling around picking up loot, precious time is wasted; you end up having to abandon Beibars and flee for your life.
{cps=50}You return empty-handed.
{cps=50}In response to your question — 'What's the next step?'— the governor says he will try to contact the Saracens through standard channels. He advises you to not expect a quick response.
{cps=50}Back in Damietta, you hand over the prisoner to the governor, who promises to take over the rest of the work.
{cps=50}According to the governor, Count de Mollet's contingent left some time ago and set out on a campaign against El Mansour — a large city amidst the desert south of the coast, deep within Saracen lands.
{cps=50}To venture there as part of such a small party is an incredibly perilous undertaking, one that almost certainly means death.
{cps=50}Maybe you should look for Renauld de Châtillon elsewhere...
{cps=50}Are you sure you want to go towards El Mansour?
{cps=50}Desperate to find any traces of Renauld in Damietta, you realize that you have no choice but to follow in the footsteps of Count de Mollet.
{cps=50}This marks the final straw for your body. The last traces of your vitality leave your body, and you perish...

{cps=50}The third day of your journey ends uneventfully.
{cps=50}After traveling a fair distance, you find a small oasis of greenery where you seek refuge from the sun's rays.
{cps=50}But your hope for rest and relaxation suddenly evaporates as a venomous scorpion appears seemingly out of nowhere and stings you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality lowered by 1!{vspace=5}Toxicity increased!
{cps=50}You continue your journey. According to the map, ahead lies a vast stretch of desolate and lifeless terrain, devoid of any natural shelters. Keen to traverse this stretch as swiftly as possible, you spend the entire day in the saddle.
{cps=50}Unfortunately, your plan doesn't pan out, and twilight takes you by surprise. You're forced to stop for the night right in the middle of the desert.
{cps=50}The night brings monstrous cold that you only miraculously manage to survive.
{cps=50}Following last night's horrifying experience, you vow to do anything in your power to avoid spending another night exposed to the elements. As the evening of the fifth day of your journey approaches, you stumble upon a cave — spacious and shielded from the wind, providing a remarkably comfortable refuge for the night.
{cps=50}Without hesitation, you decide to stop there for a rest.
{cps=50}However, not everyone approves of your decision. Upon entering the cave, [ally!ti] suddenly panics and tries to convince you that the place is cursed, begging you to leave immediately.
{cps=50}Not wanting to spend another night in the open, you order him to pull himself together and end the charade.
{cps=50}[ally!ti] refuses to heed your words and presents you with an ultimatum: either you all leave here together, or he will leave your squad without permission.
{cps=50}Getting increasingly impatient, you demand that he obey the chain of command. In response, [ally!ti] completely loses his composure and grabs his weapon...
{cps=50}Seeing that [ally!ti] has become completely unhinged, you decide that it would be easiest to let him go his own way.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}[ally!ti] left the party.
{cps=50}The consequences of last night, however, soon make themselves felt again, as you begin to feel feverish.

{cps=50}On the seventh day of your journey, a sandstorm arises, rendering navigation utterly impossible.
{cps=50}Despite your best efforts to stick together, [ally!ti] becomes separated from the squad.
{cps=50}When the storm finally subsides, [ally!ti] is nowhere to be found.
{cps=50}As you seek shelter, the wind repeatedly pelts your face with sharp grains of sand, causing injury to your eyes.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Eye injury!
{cps=50}On the ninth day of your journey, you notice a small oasis on the horizon. Thoughts of much-needed rest and the chance to quench your thirst flood your mind.
{cps=50}You decide to head for the oasis.
{cps=50}An unpleasant surprise awaits you at the oasis: it has already been claimed by a small band of Saracens, who, upon seeing you, immediately reach for their weapons.
{cps=50}But you can't afford to rest. You keep going.
{cps=50}As if by divine punishment, a terrible thirst attacks you a couple of hours later.
{cps=50}Resting at the oasis reinvigorates you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue is reduced!
{cps=50}On the tenth day of your journey, the sun, as if mocking you, starts to scorch even more intensely.
{cps=50}You stoically endure the heat. But not everyone is as resilient as you are.
{cps=50}At some point, [ally!ti] unexpectedly loses consciousness and falls from his horse. You rush to him, desperately trying to provide first aid. Sadly, he proves unresponsive.
{cps=50}And shortly stops breathing altogether.
{cps=50}You stand the heat well.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Health lowered by 10!
{cps=50}At some point, the helmet on your head becomes so hot that you faint and fall off your horse.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Health lowered by 20!
{cps=50}After regaining your senses, you continue your journey.
{cps=50}On the eleventh day of your journey, you misread your map and wander straight into quicksand.
{cps=50}You manage to escape, but [ally!ti] sinks too deep and can't get out — no matter how hard you try to pull him.
{cps=50}Thus you lose your last comrade.
{cps=50}On the thirteenth day of your journey, you stumble upon a battered band of Saracens, seemingly just emerging from a recent ordeal.
{cps=50}Despite their exhaustion, they readily engage you in battle.

{cps=50}When you've already lost all hope of ever reaching your target, you finally see it: on the horizon, behind the next dune, the minarets of El Mansur, glistening under the torrid sun.
{cps=50}Climbing on top of the dune to survey the surroundings, you witness a scene that makes your blood run cold.
{cps=50}The vast valley below is littered with rotting corpses, countless in number, so densely packed that the sand is no longer visible beneath them.
{cps=50}Saracens and Christians alike...{vspace=5}Nobles in richly decorated armor and peasant soldiers in simple chainmails...{vspace=5}Those whose faces can still be identified, and those who were mutilated beyond recognition...
{cps=50}All met their end here.
{cps=50}In hopes of finding survivors you descend into this valley of death.
{cps=50}The stench of rank blood and dead flesh makes you flinch as you wade through the battlefield. {w}{vspace=5}Just as you're about to pass out from nausea, you notice a familiar banner jutting out from the sea of corpses.
{cps=50}A banner that you've had described to you but have never seen with your own eyes.{w}{vspace=5}The banner of Count de Mollet.
{cps=50}Next to it, a prostrated man, bloodied and grasping a nasty stomach wound.
{cps=50}As you approach, you hear him faintly whispering.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Renauld...? Renauld de Châtillon?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The man slowly rises to his feet, his hand pressed against his abdomen.
{cps=50}I've finally found you.
{cps=50}Your father sent me. He wants you to return home.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Taking a deep breath, Renauld closes his eyes and, for a fleeting second, turns into a mirror image of his father.
{cps=50}Your brother Henri is seriously ill. Your father is begging for your return...
{cps=50}He told me that the fate of the whole de Châtillon family now rests in your hands.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}His voice trembles.
{cps=50}I don't want to kill you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Renauld nods understandingly.
{cps=50}You stand in the middle of a valley strewn with corpses, encircled by a barren desert stretching for leagues in every direction.
{cps=50}The unsettling realization that you travelled half the world just to end another man's life turns the whole situation into a grim metaphor of your own existence.
{cps=50}Maybe you should have stayed home.
{cps=50}But then comes the wind, its gusts slowly blanketing the corpses with fine layers of sand, dispersing your melancholic thoughts.
{cps=50}War is your trade. Honor is your compass.
{cps=50}The very same honor that brought you here.
{cps=50}Where others might have turned back, you kept trudging on. This is why your road was so hard.
{cps=50}With a deep sigh, you close Renauld's eyes for good and wipe the blood off your weapon.
{cps=50}It was time to head back.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 6 out of 10.
{cps=50}Your arrival at Greenwich Castle, as expected, causes a commotion; the news of the return of a royal knight from the war spreads like wildfire.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Despite the attention that you draw, you refrain from embellishment and recount your adventure truthfully.{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Yeah. We've heard rumors that things aren't going too well, but I didn't think it would turn out so bad...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}It's ironic, but the girl seems to believe what you say.{vspace=5}Prestige — success!
{cps=50}What an intriguing story... So you're a hero! It's strange that I've never heard your name before...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 15! {vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You're trying to sound convincing, but Alyssa looks at you with a hint of disbelief.{vspace=5}Prestige — fail (required: 40)!{vspace=5}Virtue reduced by 10!
{cps=50}What a fascinating story.
{cps=50}It's almost baffling that with heroes like you on our side, the campaign still ended in such a disaster.
{cps=50}The war is lost, the king is dead, and London, if your words are indeed true, is occupied by a traitor.
{cps=50}I'm scared to even think what might happen next.
{cps=50}The wedding fell through, naturally. The Count of Essex said that he was not going to marry a 'dirty girl'.{w} Although I've always considered that part to be my forte...
{cps=50}But what can you do, right? I'll have to search for a husband some place else.
{cps=50}Sounds like an even bigger disaster than the king's campaign in France.
{cps=50}Very likely. Honestly, the French affairs of the king never really interested me.
{cps=50}All these land disputes, military campaigns, and empty-headed knights don't excite me at all.
{cps=50}Although, looking at you, I'm beginning to believe that an empty-headed knight who doesn't ask too many questions is exactly what I might need right now.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}Thanks, milady.{w} I'll take that as a compliment.
{cps=50}I see you obviously aren't used to talking to nobility. Anything I say to you is already a compliment — simply because I'm addressing you.
{cps=50}As for your arrival in Greenwich, then — if you indeed are who you say you are — I have big plans for you.
{cps=50}Over the last year, the surrounding lands have slowly but surely been descending into utter darkness.
{cps=50}It all started shortly before the late king embarked on that foolish war of his.
{cps=50}During his military preparations, he imposed all sorts of unbearable taxes on most of his realms, including Greenwich.
{cps=50}These new taxes saw the peasants stripped clean of everything they had. This alone was enough to cause massive unrest — while the king's tax collectors and sheriffs only added fuel to the fire. Full-scale uprisings soon broke out.
{cps=50}That scoundrel calls himself 'Prince of Thieves' and is not afraid to openly threaten the surrounding castles and cities, demanding money 'for protection from bandits' - from themselves that is!
{cps=50}How come nobody has dealt with them?
{cps=50}In his heydays, my father would have crushed them like insects. But time has taken a toll not only on his body but also on his mind... These days, he's only concerned with hunting and drinking wine.
{cps=50}And I have a strange feeling that he's not trying too hard... Since the sheriff prefers to conduct his 'search for the bandits' without leaving his own estate.
{cps=50}All this to say that you need my men to fight your war.
{cps=50}You can waste as much time as you want trying to meet with the old count, but I'll tell you right away: there's no point. Because I make all the calls.
{cps=50}It's almost as if we're re-living the dark ages here. Help me deal with the bandits, and I'll guarantee you my full support in your future endeavors.
{cps=50}My men and my father's vassals will fight under your banner.
{cps=50}I don't seem to have that much of a choice, do I?
{cps=50}I will try.
{cps=50}Since we're practically under siege here, I suggest you start by clearing the surrounding areas of the bandits.
{cps=50}Once Greenwich is safe, we'll talk about dealing with the sheriff.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [dark_age.name!ti]!
{cps=50}Finding the sheriff's manor near Greenwich turns out to be quite straightforward.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A carved wooden chair covered in leather.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Nothing unusual.
{cps=50}That was an amazing strike! It seems that Greenwich will need a new sheriff.{w} The old one's looking like he's got some serious health issues.
{cps=50}You think so?
{cps=50}Oh, I am more than sure.
{cps=50}Frankly speaking, you had me a bit worried at the beginning, but luckily, everything turned out well.
{cps=50}To say that I'm very impressed would be putting it mildly.
{cps=50}And truthfully, it's not your skill with the sword that impressed me the most, but rather something else.
{cps=50}What might that be?
{cps=50}Your courage and determination.{w} No matter what I ask of you, you risk your life again and again without hesitation.
{cps=50}The absence of hesitation, of course, can also be attributed to the side effects of regularly wearing a heavy helmet and receiving blows to the head...
{cps=50}...But I don't think that is your case. At least not entirely.
{cps=50}I...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Alyssa gestures you to shut up.
{cps=50}No need to explain anything. You'll spoil the moment.
{cps=50}As you wish, milady.
{cps=50}Well now. The job's done so we can allow ourselves to have some rest.
{cps=50}I happen to know a couple of rather scenic spots near the castle. How about we take a horse ride there and back, with a little picnic in between?
{cps=50}Two weeks ago, I couldn't even imagine being able to leave Greenwich without an escort of a dozen soldiers. But looks like the times are changing...
{cps=50}So what do you say? Shall we go out on a little promenade?
{cps=50}I think that's a wonderful idea.
{cps=50}All my ideas are wonderful. Get used to it.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 5!
{cps=50}I'm sorry, milady, but I'm afraid this is not the time to have fun.
{cps=50}We aren't out of the woods yet. The bandits have not been completely dealt with, and the fate of the kingdom continues to hang by a thread.
{cps=50}The time to have fun will come. But later.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}I never expected that such a daredevil would turn out to be a bore.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}The kingdom can always wait a little more, and so can the bandits.
{cps=50}A goddamned countess is asking you out on a date, and all you're thinking about is some nonsense.
{cps=50}Someone should revise their priorities.
{cps=50}But whatever, I guess.
{cps=50}We've dealt with the sheriff. This means that our next target is Duncan, the self-proclaimed Prince of Thieves.
{cps=50}How do we find him?
{cps=50}I've been thinking about it for a while and may have found the solution.{w} I'll be waiting for you tomorrow morning.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tired from the walk, you stop for a picnic in a picturesque grove.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A laid-back atmosphere and a couple of bottles of good wine quickly do their job. Soon, you both completely forget about the bandits, Duncan, and the fate of the kingdom.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Alyssa laughs loudly at your jokes and, with genuine interest, bombards you with questions about your adventure in France.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She wants to know everything: the battles you've lived through, the people you've met... and the girls you've made promises to.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Enjoying each other's company, you don't notice how time flies.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}But the sun starts to set, and you have to turn back.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After taking the countess back to Greenwich, you say your goodbyes, agreeing to meet the morning after to talk business.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 15!
{cps=50}The bandit captured by Alyssa's men happens to be a young man about your age.
{cps=50}Of course, he refuses to tell you anything, replying only with silence and a look of disdain.
{cps=50}When you offer him a final chance to spill the beans the easy way, he grins and assures you that his comrades will surely seek revenge against you, the countess, and each of her associates.
{cps=50}Cursing you and your children, he laughs provocatively.
{cps=50}You laugh as well.{w} While pulling out a knife.
{cps=50}Fifteen minutes later, his mocking confidence is all but gone.
{cps=50}You have seen — and inflicted — enough wounds and mutilations on the battlefield, enough to understand the human body well...{w} And to know what should be done to it to keep a man suffering, an inch away from death.
{cps=50}Cut after cut.
{cps=50}Stab after stab.
{cps=50}Blow after blow.
{cps=50}Severed fingers and loose teeth now litter the blood-stained floor, yet the prisoner remains determined to resist. Only when you slowly drive your knife into his eye does he finally start screaming.
{cps=50}By the time his eyeball fell to the floor, his voice had completely broken down, reduced to a bare wheeze.
{cps=50}Pathetically slurring in his speech, he babbles he's ready to talk — if you'd just relent. Most of what he says is incoherent, but you manage to glean something about a secret location in the forest.
{cps=50}His usefulness having run out, you mercifully slit his throat.
{cps=50}You immediately dispatch one of the guards to Alyssa to report the news, while you take a moment to wash the blood off your hands.
{cps=50}But no matter how much you rub and scrub, the blood doesn't wash off...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue reduced by 70!{vspace=5}New quest added - [robbin_the_hood.name!ti].
{cps=50}The intel gleaned from the captive, further clarified by Alyssa, proves remarkably precise. Your squad finds the bandits' hideout within hours of scouring the area.
{cps=50}The camp, bustling with activities, is well-equipped and adequately hidden — perfect for a long and cozy stay.
{cps=50}The bandits who have taken refuge here seem to have settled in comfortably. The breeze carries with it soft strains of melodies, as well as the tantalizing aroma of sizzling meat.
{cps=50}There aren't any real guards around either — just a couple of groggy goons making the rounds along the camp's perimeter...{w}whom Alyssa's men swiftly dispatch with crossbow shots.
{cps=50}{i}'Tell me, ser knight, what does it feel like to realize for the first time in your life that you are fighting on the side of evil?'
{cps=50}And this is how you take the prisoner to Greenwich.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [robbin_the_hood.name!ti]!
{cps=50}After spending some time preparing to transport the captured prisoners and loot back to Greenwich, you return to the hut where Duncan is being held.
{cps=50}Such an inglorious end for a man who has become the most notorious bandit in the entire south of the kingdom.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [robbin_the_hood.name!ti]!
{cps=50}This thing has got to be about 500 years old!
{cps=50}Maybe even more. I wouldn't be surprised if the Romans used it to behead rebellious Celtic warchiefs.
{cps=50}So don't waste time, [name]. Go and retrieve the sword.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [the_sword.name!ti]!
{cps=50}Even with the help of a map and verbal instructions from the earl, finding the abbey proves difficult. You finally locate it after having wandered the area for a while.
{cps=50}Your authoritative presence commands respect from the monks, who promptly escort you to the abbot.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!
{cps=50}After listening to you attentively and closely examining the royal seal given to you by the prince, the abbot sinks into contemplation.
{cps=50}When his silence is finally broken, he confirms that the legendary sword you seek in Lindisfarne is indeed kept here. However, it would be preposterous to entrust it to just anyone — especially without a decree of the reigning king.
{cps=50}As you're about to protest, the abbot gestures you to stop, indicating that he hasn't finished speaking yet.
{cps=50}After another lengthy pause, the abbot says that there might be an exception: the most deserving individual, committed to using the sword solely for noble purposes, could be entrusted with its stewardship.
{cps=50}And he sees such a person in you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue — success!
{cps=50}And he does not see such a person in you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue — fail!
{cps=50}You try to convince him, but the abbot is adamant about his decision.
{cps=50}Your shoddy appearance does not inspire respect in the monks, and they are in no hurry to fulfill your request...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige - fail (required: 35)!
{cps=50}...however, they make it clear that they could reconsider their position for a handful of coins.
{cps=50}You don't have the required amount with you, and the monks won't agree to anything less.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}You refuse to pay, and after a few more minutes of arguing with the monks, you realize that the conversation has hit a dead end.
{cps=50}A cloud of dust on the horizon, likely stirred by the clip-clop of hooves, advances to your position. You sense it's time to leave the abbey.
{cps=50}But you aren't able to do it in time.
{cps=50}As you approach your horse, a group of armed riders storms into the inner courtyard.
{cps=50}After dismounting, several of them immediately disperse the monks with jabs and kicks and then rush inside the abbey. Some others, recognizing you as a threat, form a semi-circle around you, cutting off your escape route.
{cps=50}Now standing just a few steps away from them, you can make out their faces. One stands out from the rest.
{cps=50}Guarded by heavily armed thugs, right in front of you stands none other than Lord Canterbury.
{cps=50}Not so fast.{w} Going somewhere?
{cps=50}Do you know who I am?
{cps=50}I do.
{cps=50}Good. This means I won't have to waste my time casting pearls before swine.
{cps=50}God damn yokel...
{cps=50}Don't waste your time on him, sire! Just give me the word and I'll beat him to a pulp!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Canterbury silences him with a hand gesture.
{cps=50}My name is Alfred, Count Canterbury — right hand of the late king; the protector of the realms of the English crown and the only legitimate claimant to the throne.
{cps=50}In any other case I wouldn't waste a second of my time talking to somebody like you.
{cps=50}But it so happens that fate has chosen to bring us together under interesting circumstances.
{cps=50}I know who you are. An armed man in a half-abandoned abbey looks like a fox in a hen house.
{cps=50}I expected this.{w} Why, you ask? Because even an incompetent duo like Northampton and the young prince must understand the significance of the item that is being kept here.
{cps=50}Therefore they would obviously send someone here.{w} Probably the best man they've got.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}With a wave of his hand, Canterbury points at the men flanking him.
{cps=50}I, as you can see, came prepared.
{cps=50}Did you?
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Well, since it is you who they sent here, you are probably the best they've got.
{cps=50}And given that neither I nor Northampton can afford to squander any of our valuable men at the moment, I have a proposal for you.
{cps=50}Listen closely, I will offer you this once. No matter how much they are paying you, swear your allegiance to me and I'll double it.
{cps=50}I like your offer, but the prince and the earl pay me rather well. Very, very well.
{cps=50}How about...
{cps=50}Spare me your beggar yapping. 3000 florins and you change masters — deal?
{cps=50}I...
{cps=50}What the devil! Sire, I'll crush his skull for half this sum!
{cps=50}Roger...
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Forgive me, sire.
{cps=50}I agree.
{cps=50}A wise decision. Very wise.
{cps=50}I'm ready to give you my oath.
{cps=50}Give it to Roger. He is my second-in-command and your new boss.
{cps=50}Roger, take his oath and pay him. Be sure to put him to the test afterwards.
{cps=50}Because I wouldn't be surprised if Northampton's 'best man' will turn out to be of the same 'quality' as his 'genius' plans.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Two of Canterbury's men emerge from the abbey, one of them holding an oblong item wrapped in cloth.
{cps=50}Is that it?
{cps=50}Good. Fletcher and Foster — with me. Saddle up!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Canterbury swiftly inspects the contents of the package before returning the sword to one of his men. All three mount their horses and speed away into the distance.
{cps=50}Well now... Fall on your knees and pledge your loyalty. And 500 florins will be yours.
{cps=50}500? Weren't we talking about 3000?
{cps=50}Were you? I heard 500. And if someone's talking money, I've got the best hearing in the whole damn kingdom.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}His comrades nod in approval, smirking.
{cps=50}Then the deal is off, I'm afraid.
{cps=50}Even better. That's five hundred more for me.
{cps=50}The dead don't need money, Roger.
{cps=50}Who said I was going to leave anything on your grave?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}He raises his warhammer.
{cps=50}See this thing?
{cps=50}I hit twice. Once on the head, and again on the lid of your coffin.
{cps=50}I already swore my allegiance to another lord. I will never break my oath.
{cps=50}How admirable. To find a man of honor among low-born yokels like yourself is a rare treat.
{cps=50}I hope you won't start begging for mercy when Roger will be slitting your throat. That would ruin the picture.
{cps=50}Because dying with honor is just as important as living with it.
{cps=50}Deal with him, Roger, and get back to London. There's a lot to do.
{cps=50}Got it, sire.
{cps=50}Don't waste too much time on him. Something tells me that Northampton's 'best man' will turn out to be of the same 'quality' as his 'genius' plans.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Two of Canterbury's men emerge from the abbey, one of them holding an oblong item wrapped in cloth.
{cps=50}Is that it?
{cps=50}Good. Fletcher and Foster — with me. Saddle up!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Canterbury swiftly inspects the contents of the package before returning the sword to one of his men. All three mount their horses and speed away into the distance.
{cps=50}I can't believe it! We almost paid 3000 florins to this poor schmuck.
{cps=50}God is my witness, if the boss really gave you those three grand, I'd still kill you out of sheer principle.
{cps=50}Thanks for the honesty.
{cps=50}You're welcome, son.
{cps=50}Alright, guys. I bet you 100 florins that he will squeal like a pig when I'll be cutting off his nose.
{cps=50}You're a funny guy, Roger. I like you.{vspace=5}{w} I'll kill you last.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Roger grins wickedly and raises his warhammer.
{cps=50}See this thing?
{cps=50}I hit twice. Once on the head, and again on the lid of your coffin.
{cps=50}Having obtained the sword, you quickly leave the abbot's quarters and return to the inner courtyard, intending to leave the abbey without delay.
{cps=50}A cloud of dust on the horizon, likely stirred by the clip-clop of hooves, advances to your position. You need to leave — quickly.
{cps=50}But the massive doors of the abbey slam shut behind you, stranding you in the courtyard. It looks like you won't be leaving anytime soon after all.
{cps=50}Not so fast, boy.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A small group of well-armed warriors blocks you from reaching your horse. Among them, the man himself: Count Canterbury.
{cps=50}Do you know who I am?
{cps=50}I do.
{cps=50}Good. This means I won't have to waste my time casting pearls before swine.
{cps=50}God damn yokel...
{cps=50}Don't waste your time on him, sire! Just give me the word and I'll beat him to a pulp!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Canterbury silences him with a hand gesture.

{cps=50}In any other case I wouldn't waste a second of my time talking with somebody like you.
{cps=50}But it so happens that this thing you wield in your hands is highly important. So much so that even those two imbeciles that you're serving understand its value.
{cps=50}And since they do, it would be fair to assume that they sent their best man.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Which brings us back to you.
{cps=50}Listen closely, I will offer you this once. No matter how much they are paying you, swear your allegiance to me and I'll double it.
{cps=50}I like your offer, but the prince and the earl pay me rather well. Very, very well.

{cps=50}Roger...
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Forgive me, sire.
{cps=50}I accept these terms. Here's the sword.
{cps=50}A wise decision. Very wise.
{cps=50}I'm ready to give you my oath.
{cps=50}You'll give it to Roger. He is my second-in-command and your new boss.
{cps=50}Roger, take his oath and pay him. Don't forget to put him to the test afterwards.
{cps=50}Because I wouldn't be surprised if Northampton's 'best man' will turn out to be of the same 'quality' as his 'genius' plans.
{cps=50}Fletcher and Foster — with me. Saddle up!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Canterbury hands over the sword to one of his followers; the three of them mount their horses and speed away.
{cps=50}Well now... Fall on your knees and pledge your loyalty. And 500 florins will be yours.
{cps=50}500? Weren't we talking about 3000?

{cps=50}Fletcher and Foster — with me. Saddle up!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Having saddled their horses, the trio quickly takes off into the distance, leaving you with Roger and half a dozen of his fighters.
{cps=50}I can't believe it! We almost paid 3000 florins to this poor schmuck.
{cps=50}God is my witness, if the boss really gave you those three grand, I'd still kill out of sheer principle.
{cps=50}Thanks for the honesty.
{cps=50}You're welcome, son.
{cps=50}Alright, guys. I bet you a hundred that he will squeal like a pig when I'll be cutting off his nose.
{cps=50}You're a funny guy, Roger. I like you.{vspace=5}{w} I'll kill you last.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Roger grins wickedly and raises his warhammer.
{cps=50}See this thing?
{cps=50}I hit twice. Once on the head, and again on the lid of your coffin.
{cps=50}I see you're not coming back empty-handed. Frankly speaking, it's hard to believe that the sword was still there after all those years.
{cps=50}Finding it was a breeze. Retrieving it, however, was a whole different story.
{cps=50}No wonder. The weather's awfully sultry.
{cps=50}If it wasn't for a couple of barrels of cold Burgundian wine from the cellars of Dartford, we'd collapse from the heat here, too.
{cps=50}If anyone had it easy, it was you. Riding on horseback with a gentle breeze against your back beats staying indoors and hunching over the maps in this sweltering heat.
{cps=50}The cold Burgundy was surprisingly good, actually.
{cps=50}Agreed. Given the pigwash we had to slurp back on the ship, it's no wonder that even Dartford's provisions now seem like divine nectar to us.
{cps=50}Someday we'll get to Aquitaine, and that's where you'll taste real wine. The best wine on the continent.
{cps=50}I'm sorry to interrupt your little wine-and-weather talk, but it wasn't the heat that made me sweat. It was Canterbury's men.
{cps=50}Had I showed up even half an hour later, the sword would've been long gone.
{cps=50}But you showed up right on time.
{cps=50}...and we all know why.
{cps=50}Meticulous planning.
{cps=50}And tactical genius.
{cps=50}Don't blink too often, [name], or you'll miss the history being written right before your very eyes.
{cps=50}The minstrels will compose poems about this day.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}I'm sorry for asking, but didn't we just lose the war by getting stuck for months under the walls of some pathetic little town?
{cps=50}And aren't we currently just a step away from being outsmarted and crushed by a ruthless, scheming traitor?
{cps=50}Cheer up, [name]. Everything's under control.{vspace=5}{w}As it always has been.
{cps=50}Has it, sire?
{cps=50}Absolutely. There's an easy way to tell whether you have it under control or not.{vspace=5}{w}If you're not lying in a ditch with a knife in your belly...
{cps=50}...and if your head is no further away from your shoulders than a third of a foot...
{cps=50}...then you're doing rather fine.
{cps=50}You can hold onto the sword for now, if you fancy it. Otherwise, you can leave it here.
{cps=50}Its time will come.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) improved by 15!{vspace=5}70 florins received!
{cps=50}It looks like [name] is back... But I don't see the sword.
{cps=50}Where's the sword, [name]?
{cps=50}Canterbury's got it. His men caught me at Lindisfarne before I could escape.
{cps=50}I tried to fight them off, but I was seriously outnumbered. It's a miracle I even made it out alive.
{cps=50}Oh well... That means he won the first round.
{cps=50}This wasn't entirely unexpected, but I still had hoped for the best.
{cps=50}Alas, it is what it is.
{cps=50}Let that be a lesson for all of us — and by 'all of us', I mean you, [name] — that we must not forget whom we're dealing with.
{cps=50}Canterbury is as smart as he is ruthless. We cannot underestimate him.
{cps=50}No matter what we do, we always have to be ready for the worst.
{cps=50}Well said.
{cps=50}We might have let the sword slip through our hands — and you know who I mean by 'we', [name] — but we absolutely cannot let the same happen to Caldwell's daughter.
{cps=50}We can't afford any more mistakes.
{cps=50}And when I say 'we', [name]...
{cps=50}I got it, sire.
{cps=50}I won't fail you again.
{cps=50}I sincerely hope so.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}A messenger brings you an order from the earl. You are to report to him immediately.
{cps=50}A messenger brings you an order from the earl. You are to report to him immediately.
{cps=50}How do you like the royal residence, [name]? Impressed yet?
{cps=50}Beats the tents under the walls of Cambrai, doesn't it?
{cps=50}It surely does.
{cps=50}The last few days have been remarkably calm. We've all finally been able to catch our breath a little.
{cps=50}But now it's time to get back to work.
{cps=50}First, the bad news: before retreating, Canterbury not only emptied what remained of the treasury but also made off with the royal regalia traditionally used for coronation ceremonies.
{cps=50}By doing so, he has postponed my official ascension to the throne.
{cps=50}Isn't there a way to do it without the regalia? It can't be that important, can it?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Prince Edward and Earl Northampton give you a deadpan stare.
{cps=50}Did you seriously just ask us that, [name]?
{cps=50}I do understand that you are... a simple person, [name] — a man of the people, so to speak — but this is a bit too much even by your standards.
{cps=50}No, we can't do the coronation without the regalia, [name]. Being crowned without the ceremonial diadem and scepter is pretty much the same as being crowned naked.
{cps=50}It won't count.{vspace=5}The coronation is a sacred ceremony, [name]. You can't just conduct it however you please.
{cps=50}What are we going to do now?
{cps=50}What are we going to do now?
{cps=50}We weren't the only ones who got a respite — so did Canterbury. One can say that, at the Battle of London, he practically gifted us the victory by deploying an untrained mob instead of a proper army.
{cps=50}He won't be giving us any more of those gifts.
{cps=50}Our spies report that Oxford and its surroundings are packed with military encampments. New recruits are being trained around the clock.
{cps=50}We also know for a certainty that at least one ship from the continent came to reinforce him. Who was on board is unknown, but most likely mercenaries.
{cps=50}Or some of his men who got left behind.
{cps=50}Or them, yes. In any case, we should prepare for the worst.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}As for you, [name], a diplomatic mission awaits you this time.
{cps=50}We need allies. There isn't anyone left to the south of the Thames; all the lords of those realms are already fighting either on our side or on the rebels'...
{cps=50}But, north of the capital, numerous counts, barons, and dukes retain significant military strength but have yet to take a side in this war...
{cps=50}I believe their decision will determine the outcome of this conflict.
{cps=50}Exactly. We'll be sending regular couriers to these lords, but three are particularly important.
{cps=50}You will personally deliver the letters to them.{w} Both as my official representative and a man I truly rely on.
{cps=50}You'll be responsible for these letters, [name].
{cps=50}Understood. So who does this mysterious trio consist of?
{cps=50}Three former associates of my father, who once helped him to ascend the throne.
{cps=50}But over time, their friendship with the king degraded... to the point they were no longer allies. No longer friends.
{cps=50}And what was the reason for that?
{cps=50}They had... different views.{w} On various important issues.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Northampton and Prince Edward exchange meaningful glances. After a short pause, the earl takes word.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}He speaks methodically, carefully choosing his words.
{cps=50}I do not think that this information is necessary for you, [name]. The less you know, the better you sleep.
{cps=50}But sire...
{cps=50}No buts. Rest assured that you've been told everything you need to know.
{cps=50}Come visit me when you're ready to set out. For now, take a quick rest and get yourself in good condition. You have a couple of very long journeys ahead of you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [hellish_trio.name!ti].
{cps=50}A messenger brings you urgent news from the earl: the rebels have made a move towards Windsor, a small town near the capital.
{cps=50}Northampton wants you to head there right away and prevent Canterbury's men from capturing the town.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [breakthrough.name!ti].
{cps=50}You waste too much time, allowing the rebels not only to seize Windsor but also to establish a significant foothold there.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) lowered by 30!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 25!{vspace=5}Prestige lowered by 1!
{cps=50}Following a stern reprimand from Northampton, you approach Windsor with the loyalists' main forces — only to find it transformed from a tranquil town into a well-defended citadel.{vspace=5}It quickly becomes evident that it is going to be a tough nut to crack.
{cps=50}While the soldiers are busy setting up a field camp, Northampton gathers a war council...
{cps=50}All right, gentlemen, let me be clear.{w} It looks like we're knee deep in shite.
{cps=50}Those scoundrels have captured an important town right under our noses and are setting up defensive positions capable of withstanding a prolonged siege. Any minute that we waste is a minute the enemy spends fortifying their defences.
{cps=50}I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow morning we'll wake up to that place looking like a veritable fortress.{w} And the day after it may very well get to the point where we'll be needing trebuchets and battering rams to even have a chance of a successful assault.
{cps=50}So there's no time to waste.
{cps=50}Those of you who have been under the walls of Cambrai know perfectly well that one bad siege can easily cost you the whole campaign.
{cps=50}Guess who else knows that?{w} Canterbury. He's been there before, and it looks like he's trying to recreate this scenario... except this time with him playing the part of the French.
{cps=50}Thus, we'll have to be absolutely ruthless.
{cps=50}[name]. Let's be honest: you've dropped the ball on this one, so you'll have to do the heavy lifting this time.
{cps=50}You're no rookie. After Cambrai, Dartford, and London, you should have a pretty good understanding of how to wage a war... at least on a smaller scale.{vspace=5}You'll be responsible for taking Windsor back.
{cps=50}I won't fail you, sire. With all the men that we have, I'll capture the town tomorrow morning.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A faint laughter ripples through the gathering.
{cps=50}I like the attitude, [name], but I don't intend on risking our main forces for this kind of battle.
{cps=50}Perhaps you're right that you can capture the town in one assault with a full army under your command. But what if you fail...{vspace=5}{w}I'm too old to take such a gamble.
{cps=50}I've besieged and captured more towns and castles than you can count, [name]. Here's what I'll tell you: there are only two ways to capture a fortified city. The first one is through attrition.{w}{vspace=5}And the second one is by throwing bodies at it. A lot of bodies.
{cps=50}I've already told you that we don't really have time for a lengthy siege, so that rules out the first option.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}Doesn't that mean that we'll have to risk our men either way?
{cps=50}We will have to, yes. But not the 'good' ones. At least not those sitting around you right now.{vspace=5}{w}Knights don't climb town walls with siege ladders, [name]. That's not the most chivalrous thing.
{cps=50}You've been under Cambrai as an infantryman, haven't you? So you should know who usually leads the charge in these kinds of 'situations'.
{cps=50}Militiamen...
{cps=50}You're goddamn right. Peasants.
{cps=50}Thomas Marshall and his troops will take up positions to the north and northwest of Windsor, aiming to hinder rebel reinforcements and disrupt supply lines wherever feasible.
{cps=50}And you, [name], will gather the men and attack the town. Again and again. Until it is ours.
{cps=50}I know that you're the type who enjoys inspiring others with acts of bravado, but this time, allow someone else to take on the role of the hero.
{cps=50}It's about time you learned how to do that.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [case_windsor.name!ti]!
{cps=50}As for me? I'm going back to London.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The siege of Windsor will consume a lot of time and effort. Bashing your head against the town walls in an attempt to capture it yourself might not be the smartest idea.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The lords, as well as various other characters, might offer you some help. It would be wise to search for assistance wherever you can.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Baron of Colchester sent you 30 men for the Siege of Windsor.
{cps=50}As you hasten towards Windsor, you keep bumping into disordered, battered bands of loyalists fleeing from the carnage.
{cps=50}Many of them are wounded, and their morale appears to be virtually nonexistent.
{cps=50}Positioning your men to block their escape, you order them to join your detachment.
{cps=50}Your authority and self-confidence impress the soldiers. Those still capable of fighting obey your orders and join your ranks.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) — success!
{cps=50}Your authority fails to impress these soldiers. Your attempt to force them back onto the battlefield only results in further angering them.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) — fail!
{cps=50}Some even threaten you with their weapons, claiming that they won't hesitate to use them against you should you not step out of their way.
{cps=50}Getting into a fight with potential allies before you have even crossed blades with the enemies seems like a really bad idea. You settle for calling the retreating soldiers 'cowards' and 'disloyal dogs' before continuing towards the Windsor — without their aid.
{cps=50}While bloodshed has been avoided, this shameful display of leadership, with you being unable to control even the lowliest of peasants, tarnishes your reputation — especially in the eyes of your own troops. It is not every day that they get to see paupers threaten a knight and get away with it.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 15!{vspace=5}Prestige lowered by 5!
{cps=50}The fact that these filthy peasants dare threaten you — a knight, no less — throws you into a rage. You immediately reach for your scabbard.
{cps=50}The sight of an angry knight unsheathing his weapon cools the soldiers' fervor, visibly shattering their confidence.
{cps=50}But just as they were about to submit to your will, a young soldier from the crowd raises his voice.
{cps=50}In an accusatory tone, the man brands the knights as 'dogs who shepherd soldiers to battle like lambs to the slaughter' and urges his comrades to ignore your orders and flee to the woods.
{cps=50}Hearing a buzz of approval rippling through the crowd, you command the man to shut up. Unfortunately, the mob has already rallied behind him. The soldiers turn their weapons against you.
{cps=50}Seeing the miserable state of the retreating soldiers, you decide not to waste your time with them and instead press onward towards Windsor.
{cps=50}Struck down by your blow, the cowardly soldier falls to the ground.{w} Heavily wounded, he tries to crawl away...
{cps=50}It takes all your self-control to stay your hand and not slay this pitiful creature. Seeing as he most likely doesn't have long to live, you mercifully allow him to crawl away.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}Pinning him to the ground with your foot, you gleefully cut his throat with a dagger.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 25!{vspace=5}Prestige increased by 1!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}With many of their comrades dead and no real chance of winning the fight, the remaining soldiers drop their weapons and run for their lives.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}As you approach Windsor, you are met with a discouraging sight: the entire town has fallen into enemy hands, with several rebel banners proudly flying over its ancient yet formidable walls.
{cps=50}Upon noticing your arrival, the enemy springs to life, and the fortress walls start to fill with people. However, their numbers are sparse, confirming your suspicions that it's a small contingent.
{cps=50}It becomes clear that the force defending Windsor may indeed be quite limited in size.
{cps=50}Weighing the possible courses of action, you conclude that your best option is to assault its walls.
{cps=50}This idea, however, fills you with memories of a particular event by the name of the 'Siege of Cambrai', which was supposed to be an easy operation but instead devolved into a months-long nightmare.
{cps=50}You've been clearly instructed that the town of Windsor cannot fall into enemy hands, and thus you don't really have a choice.{vspace=5}With these thoughts, you order your men to prepare for an assault.
{cps=50}Following a brief tactical assessment, you decide to target the southern wall — the most decayed, with small parts of it already in a state of collapse.
{cps=50}You order your men to raise their shields and assemble into a tight formation. Joining this veritable contraption of metal and spears, you and your troops steadily advance towards the town at the sound of gongs.
{cps=50}As you approach within firing distance, the rebels rain down torrents of bolts and arrows from the ramparts.
{cps=50}Fortunately, the limited number of enemy archers is not sufficient to impede your advance towards the battlements.
{cps=50}Unwilling to risk your best men in a blind assault, you decide to deploy the retreating soldiers that you've picked up on your way to Windsor.
{cps=50}Forming a shield wall, they slowly advance towards the collapsed section of the southern wall.
{cps=50}As they approach the ramparts, the rebels begin to unleash a torrent of bolts and arrows, resulting in the death and injury of several of your troops.
{cps=50}Bloodied and battered, some of your troops succeed in reaching the wall and engage in close-quarters combat with the defenders. But as they suffer further losses, their morale wavers, and they retreat.
{cps=50}With your failed attempt at a frontal assault, you now lack the manpower to orchestrate another offensive. You have no choice but to set up camp and wait for reinforcements.
{cps=50}The psychological trauma sustained during the Siege of Cambrai weighs heavily upon you, dissuading any notion of attempting another assault.
{cps=50}Lacking the necessary manpower to do anything else, you have no choice but to set up camp and wait for reinforcements.
{cps=50}Fresh forces, led by Northampton himself, show up only at nightfall.
{cps=50}Not only do the rebels prove to be stubborn defenders, but there are also more of them than you initially expected.
{cps=50}Realizing that the tide of the battle is turning against you, you decide to order a retreat.
{cps=50}The enemy, equally weary and worn out, makes no effort to pursue, allowing you to safely return to your original position.
{cps=50}Not only do the rebels prove to be stubborn defenders, but there are also more of them than you initially expected.
{cps=50}Realizing that the tide of the battle is turning against you, you decide to order a retreat.
{cps=50}The enemy, equally weary and worn out, makes no effort to pursue, allowing you to safely return to your original position.
{cps=50}Fresh forces, led by Northampton himself, arrive only at nightfall — when it's already too dark to attempt any more offensives.
{cps=50}While the soldiers are busy setting up a field camp, Northampton convenes a war council, during which you deliver your report.
{cps=50}All right, gentlemen, let me be clear.{w} It looks like we're knee deep in shite.

{cps=50}So there's no time to waste.
{cps=50}Those of you who have been under the walls of Cambrai know perfectly well that one bad siege can easily cost you the whole campaign.
{cps=50}Guess who else knows that?{w} Canterbury. He's been there before, and it looks like he's trying to recreate this scenario... except this time with him playing the part of the French.

{cps=50}[name]. After Cambrai, Dartford, and London, you should have a pretty good understanding of how to wage a war... at least on a smaller scale.{vspace=5}You'll be responsible for taking Windsor back.
{cps=50}Thank you for your trust, sire.
{cps=50}My men have almost managed to break into the town on their own. With all these forces that we have now, I'll easily capture Windsor tomorrow morning.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A faint laughter ripples through the gathering.
{cps=50}I like the attitude, [name], but I don't intend on risking our main forces for this kind of battle.

{cps=50}To launch an assault on the town, you'll need at least six militiamen under your command. Any force smaller than that will be incapable of accomplishing anything...
{cps=50}You send your militiamen to attack...
{cps=50}Your men also managed to capture some equipment.
{cps=50}Your men also managed to capture some equipment.
{cps=50}After several weeks of fighting, you still fail to capture Windsor.
{cps=50}Worried by the rumors of the imminent arrival of Canterbury's main force, Northampton orders a withdrawal of the loyalist forces, repositioning them back to London.

{cps=50}You retreat...
{cps=50}Whispers of the fierce battle for Windsor and the countless lives lost during it slowly circulate, initially within the capital and its environs, and subsequently, throughout the entire kingdom.
{cps=50}Your name is gaining notoriety.{vspace=5}Or, perhaps, recognition.
{cps=50}The ongoing 'Windsor meat grinder' becomes one of the main topics of discussion in taverns across the kingdom.
{cps=50}Over tankards of ale, patrons solemnly commemorate the fallen warriors and engage in lively discussions regarding the war's trajectory. You are also frequently mentioned, dubbed no other than 'The Butcher of Windsor'.
{cps=50}You don't consider this moniker to be particularly flattering, but, as Northampton points out:{vspace=5}{i}'The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about'.{/i}
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige increased by 1!
{cps=50}And almost as confirmation of his words, you are soon approached by several mercenary warbands who journeyed to London from the northern realms.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!
{cps=50}They offer to help with the siege for a modest reward.
{cps=50}News of your defeat at Windsor and the rebels' capture of the town incite panic in London, spawning provocative rumors.
{cps=50}In taverns, markets, and wharfs, the buzz is that Prince Edward has been betrayed by his own officers and that his days are numbered.
{cps=50}More than anyone else, they lay blame on a young upstart knight, whom the prince, in his inexperience, appointed as his right hand. Apparently, the fool not only allowed the rebels to take Windsor but also failed to reclaim the town.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 20!{vspace=5}Prestige lowered by 1!
{cps=50}The defenders of Windsor fight ferociously, and you decide to retreat...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Rounds until retreat: 5
{cps=50}Rumors of the battles at Windsor and the promise of spoils attract warmongers from all walks of life.
{cps=50}One day, a band of hardened brigands arrives at your encampment. They claim to have heard about your notoriety and express interest in joining your campaign under your command.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue - success!
{cps=50}Earl Northampton's patronage allows you to join a meeting of the merchant guild.
{cps=50}You are introduced as the commander responsible for defeating the rebels near London and currently leading the Siege of Windsor.
{cps=50}Your sloppy appearance fails to appeal to the merchants. They quickly lose interest in your words, writing off everything you say as yet another attempt to solicit money from them.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige - fail (required: 50)!
{cps=50}You brief the merchants on the fierce battles at Windsor and warn them that a loss there would lead to the siege of London. Such an outcome would not only bring about bloodshed and destruction but also spell disaster for metropolitan businesses.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!
{cps=50}Your words, backed by your impressive performance and impeccable appearance, leave a lasting impact on the guild members.
{cps=50}After deliberation, they convey their willingness to provide you with financial assistance and inquire about the specific amount needed.
{cps=50}You ask for 10,000 florins.
{cps=50}You ask for 5,000 florins.
{cps=50}You ask for 3,000 florins.
{cps=50}You ask for 1,000 florins.
{cps=50}Upon hearing that you only require 500 florins, the merchants breathe a collective sigh of relief and promptly agree to the desired sum.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}500 florins received!
{cps=50}Good relations with Northampton and a respectable position at the young prince's court open all kinds of doors for you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) — success!
{cps=50}Including those to the venerable and expansive royal library, located in the London royal residence.
{cps=50}You can't afford to go through all of these treatises due to time constraints, but familiarizing yourself with one or two seems manageable.
{cps=50}Studying several essays on siege tactics has made you much more competent in this area.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Planning efficiency in the preparation of an assault has been increased!
{cps=50}You head towards the residence of the Baron of Colchester: Hadley Castle.
{cps=50}Not far from the castle, a well-fortified outpost guarded by a handful of soldiers is blocking your path...
{cps=50}The residence of the Baron of Colchester, Castle Hadley, is located in the northeastern lands, quite a distance from London.
{cps=50}As the northeast was untouched by the fighting between the loyalists and the rebels, traveling through these lands should theoretically be relatively safe.
{cps=50}Indeed, the few days that it took you to travel from the capital to the baron's lands have been peaceful.
{cps=50}However, throughout your journey, you couldn't help but notice that the landscape around grew increasingly dismal.
{cps=50}Prosperous villages and vibrant cities were left behind, giving way to dilapidated villages and impoverished towns. Rats and ragged individuals, clad in tatters from head to toe, wandered the semi-deserted streets.
{cps=50}Completing the picture were endless fields of freshly dug graves, invariably found outside every settlement you encountered.
{cps=50}Seeing the same pattern over and over, you begin to suspect that the plague epidemic mentioned by Northampton was far from being subdued; rather, it seems to have gained the upper hand.
{cps=50}Even you yourself are beginning to feel some kind of malaise, which intensifies with each hour spent in these lands.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality, Trinkets — fail!{vspace=5}Toxicity increased!
{cps=50}As the faint outlines of Hadley Castle finally emerge over the hills on the horizon, you come across an outpost on the road, the first in quite some time.
{cps=50}The soldiers guarding the outpost blend in perfectly with the desolate landscape surrounding them — weapons and armor coated in rust, clothes caked with dirt, and skin marred with scabs and blisters.
{cps=50}Rude and wretched facial expressions complement the picture, their demeanor promising an unpleasant interaction.
{cps=50}As you draw closer, a towering warrior emerges, nudging his peers aside with his shoulders, his face obscured by the visor of his helmet.
{cps=50}Casting a quick glance at you, he takes you for a healer and asks if you're heading to the baron's court at his behest.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Trinkets, Items - success!
{cps=50}You mumble something in the affirmative, and the soldiers let you through.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The arrogance with which he addresses you makes you angry.
{cps=50}Open your eyes, you bastard. It's not a peasant you're talking to. Show some respect and watch your tongue.
{cps=50}If you don't want to lose it.
{cps=50}I am here on behalf of Prince Edward, son of the late king and the rightful heir to the throne.
{cps=50}I have been ordered to meet with the baron and this is exactly what I'm going to do.
{cps=50}Even if that means stepping over a couple of dead bodies.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You obey his command and turn back.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige reduced by 1!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}The Baron of Colchester's men run after you but quickly give up, reluctant to stray too far from the outpost.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Having dealt with the soldiers at the outpost, you press on.
{cps=50}A few more hours on the road pass, and you finally find yourself at the base of Castle Hadley. But the path is blocked by yet another outpost — this one far more daunting than the last.
{cps=50}After stopping nearby to catch your breath and think about your next move, you notice a small van, likely belonging to a traveling alchemist or healer, pulling up to the outpost.{w} Much to your surprise, the soldiers grant it passage to the castle.
{cps=50}Recalling your infiltration of Cambrai under the guise of a monk, you recognize that the same trick might work here too. The only difference is that you'll need to pretend to be some kind of healer or alchemist instead.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated — [hellish_trio_hadley.name!ti].
{cps=50}After a brief inspection, the soldiers do indeed mistake you for a healer and inquire whether you're heading to the baron's court at his behest.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Trinkets, Items - success!
{cps=50}You mumble something affirmative and the guards let you through.
{cps=50}Your attempt to fool the soldiers at the outpost fails. You have to flee.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: 2!
{cps=50}You decide to turn back.
{cps=50}The Baron of Colchester's men run after you but quickly give up, reluctant to stray too far from the outpost.
{cps=50}Back in London, you provide Northampton with a report on your journey to Hadley.
{cps=50}Unhappy with your failure, the earl remarks that the decision to force your way to the baron's court was obviously wrong.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}The interior of Castle Hadley is far from impressive. Clearly designed for far more inhabitants than it currently accommodates, it gives the impression of a half-abandoned, if not dying, place.
{cps=50}You are refused a private audience with the baron and instead escorted to the court physician, who mistakes you for a traveling medic — one of the numerous alchemists, physicians, and healers summoned to Hadley at the baron's request.
{cps=50}The physician informs you that Colchester is ready to pay 5,000 florins to anyone capable of developing a cure that would quell the epidemic ravaging his lands.
{cps=50}This substantial reward has attracted all sorts of specialists from all over the kingdom, but so far, no one has managed to claim it.
{cps=50}Judging by the rapidly deteriorating state of affairs, it seems unlikely that anyone will succeed anytime soon...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated — [hellish_trio_hadley.name!ti].
{cps=50}The physician who greets you is interested in your progress...
{cps=50}Quickly glancing at your antidote, the healer remarks with a grin that this concoction is only effective for common colds.
{cps=50}Quickly glancing at your antidote, the healer remarks with a grin that this concoction is only effective for common colds.
{cps=50}Studying your antidote with curiosity, the healer agrees to test it on one of the newly infected. To everyone's surprise, the patient who had to ingest the medicine shows signs of improvement before your very eyes.
{cps=50}That same night, the court physician studies the antidote's recipe and prepares the initial batch with your assistance.
{cps=50}The following morning, the Baron of Colchester finally grants you the eagerly anticipated private audience to express his gratitude and offer you the reward.
{cps=50}Recalling the profound animosity harbored by the inhabitants of Hadley towards the royal house, you opt not to risk seeking assistance from the Baron in the war, contenting yourself with accepting the promised reward from him.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}5,000 florins received.
{cps=50}Back in London, you provide Northampton with a report on your journey to Hadley.
{cps=50}Dissatisfied with the result, the earl points out to you that the decision to refuse Colchester's help was a mistake and adds that he will watch with interest as you pelt Canterbury's men with your newly received coins.{vspace=5} {color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Upon hearing your refusal of the reward and learning the true purpose of your visit to Hadley, the baron flies into a rage.
{cps=50}However, his anger eventually wears off, and the baron admits that, while his disdain for the former king and his lineage remains firm, he cannot abandon you and feels compelled to express gratitude for rescuing his territories from the epidemic.
{cps=50}He does note that the disease has severely crippled the strength of his troops, so the assistance he can provide will be minimal.
{cps=50}The residence of the Marquis of Radcliffe, Chippenham Castle, is located far west of the capital, bordering the Welsh wilderness.
{cps=50}Not only have you never been to these places, but you also don't even know anything about them. Except, perhaps, for the fact that these lands are rather poor and surrounded by total wilderness.
{cps=50}Reflecting on Northampton's unwillingness to share any information about Radcliffe and his isolated place of abode, you grow more convinced that it's improbable that the marquis willingly selected Chippenham as his residence.
{cps=50}The journey goes quickly while you are absorbed in your thoughts. You find yourself on the outskirts of Chippenham before long.
{cps=50}As you catch sight of the silhouette of a small castle on the horizon a league away, you happily note that your trip has been surprisingly calm and uneventful.
{cps=50}That's when you realize that you haven't encountered a single patrol or outpost in the lands of the Marquis of Radcliffe.
{cps=50}At that moment, as if on cue, several bandit-type characters jump out of the thick grove to the left and right of the road, blocking your horse and pressing their spears against your throat.
{cps=50}My name is [name] and I am a knight in the service of the Earl of Northampton. I am to head to the court of the Marquis of Radcliffe, on behalf of Prince Edward, son of the late king and the rightful heir to the throne.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}...!?
{cps=50}But didn't he...
{cps=50}But wasn't he executed at Greenwich just a couple of weeks ago?{vspace=5}I saw him burn at the stake with my own eyes!
{cps=50}The marquis, I suppose.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}He's a dangerous person, that Duncan.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Who's this Duncan?
{cps=50}If Duncan is indeed the new master of Chippenham, then I would like to meet him.
{cps=50}There's a business proposition I'd like to make him.
{cps=50}Things like that do happen.
{cps=50}For that kind of money, you'd have to carry me to Chippenham in your arms...{w} Very gently, I might add.
{cps=50}Don't you think that is a bit too much?
{cps=50}Taking advantage of the circumstances, huh?
{cps=50}Deal.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Upon receiving the money, Jones and his men escort you to Chippenham.
{cps=50}I don't have that much.
{cps=50}Deal.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After getting what they want, Jones and his men escort you to Chippenham.
{cps=50}Shut your mouth, you scoundrel.
{cps=50}In fact, I've got an even better idea...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You don't have time to finish your sentence; one of the bandits suddenly attacks you, knocking you out of the saddle...
{cps=50}I've got an even better proposition, my round friend.
{cps=50}How about you pay me 250 florins and in return I won't...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You don't have time to finish your sentence, because one of the bandits suddenly attacks you, knocking you out of the saddle...
{cps=50}Well, since it's obviously impossible to get an audience with the marquis now, I should probably be turning back.
{cps=50}Send my regards to Duncan and my warm congratulations to the... 'free people of Chippenham'.
{cps=50}Deal.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Upon receiving the money, Jones and his men lower their spears, allowing you to turn back from whence you came.
{cps=50}I do not have that much on me.
{cps=50}Deal.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After getting what they want, Jones and his men lower their spears, allowing you to turn back from whence you came.
{cps=50}Shut your mouth, you scoundrel.
{cps=50}In fact, I've got an even better idea...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You don't have time to finish your sentence; one of the bandits suddenly attacks you, knocking you out of the saddle...
{cps=50}I've got an even better proposition, my round friend.
{cps=50}How about you pay me 250 florins instead, and in return, I won't...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You don't have time to finish your sentence; one of the bandits suddenly attacks you, knocking you out of the saddle...
{cps=50}Back in London, you provide Northampton with a report on your journey to Chippenham.
{cps=50}The earl is dissatisfied with the lack of results, but his anger quickly turns to concern upon learning that the marquis has fallen at the hands of bandits.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Intimidated by your ferocity, the bandits seemingly start having second thoughts about their decision to mess with you.
{cps=50}The tide of the battle is now turning against you. You decide to retreat.
{cps=50}Numerical advantage was not enough to save the bandits. As they lie dead on the road, you turn around and return from whence you came.
{cps=50}Numerical advantage was not enough to save the bandits. As they lie dead on the road, you press on towards the castle that once belonged to the marquis.
{cps=50}Chippenham Castle, despite its status as the official residence of the marquis, turns out to be relatively small and unassuming — smaller than even Dartford.
{cps=50}Upon getting closer, you notice that everything about the castle and its surroundings appears oddly normal. Everyday life is in full swing in the peasants' huts near the walls, crossbowmen vigilantly stand guard on the towers, and some sort of flag flies over the donjon.
{cps=50}The new master of Chippenham greets you in the throne room, seated at the head of a massive table on a throne that, evidently, was occupied by the marquis not long ago.
{cps=50}Anticipating an encounter with a highway bandit, you're rather taken aback to find yourself face-to-face with a well-groomed man clad in silks and brocades. Complementing his appearance are an impressive gold chain around his neck and an array of rings boasting various gemstones on his fingers.
{cps=50}Had it not been for Jones' warning, you might have mistaken him for the real Marquis of Radcliffe.
{cps=50}This strange sensation intensifies when the man introduces himself as {i}Marquis Duncan of Chippenham{/i} and makes it clear that he expects you to address him as such.
{cps=50}After introducing yourself, you briefly state the purpose of your visit and invite the {i}marquis{/i} to support Prince Edward in his struggle against the rebels.
{cps=50}As you speak, a procession of servants shuttles back and forth to Duncan, offering him wine, fanning him, and intermittently bringing him notes and whispering secrets into his ear.
{cps=50}Duncan appears disinterested throughout your speech, but he surprises you with a question as soon as you finish.{w}{vspace=5}Exactly the same one that Jones asked an hour ago.
{cps=50}'What will I get out of this?'
{cps=50}Assuming that Duncan wants money, you promise {i}the marquis{/i} a hefty sum of florins. To your astonishment, he shakes his head.
{cps=50}Duncan emphasizes his willingness to support Prince Edward, but only in return for a specific favor...
{cps=50}Duncan needs a promise from Edward that, upon ascending to the throne, he will pardon all of his associates on behalf of the crown and formally confer upon him the title of marquis, ensuring the position will be passed on to his descendants.
{cps=50}Striking a deal with a glorified bandit evokes disgust, but you have to overcome your own feelings.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 50!
{cps=50}Despite coming from a glorified bandit, the request itself seems reasonable. You accept Duncan's offer on behalf of the prince. {i}Marquis Duncan of Chippenham{/i}, for his part, promises you assistance in the war against the rebels.
{cps=50}Back in London, you provide Northampton and the prince with a report on your journey to Chippenham. Neither of them is thrilled about the idea of dealing with Duncan, but both agree with your decision, acknowledging that now is not the time to be picky about allies.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Marquis Duncan of Chippenham{/i} agrees to support you in the war!{vspace=5}You can recruit men in Chippenham!{vspace=5}Reputation (earl) increased by 15!
{cps=50}The notion of striking a deal with a bandit already doesn't sit well with you. But Duncan's impudent proposal is nothing short of revolting.
{cps=50}A vision of Alyssa appears before your eyes, reminding you about the horrors that Duncan and his people committed in Greenwich. She also warns you that if a peasant is not punished for raising his hand against a lord or knight, he will be emboldened to do so against all of the nobility.
{cps=50}You tell Duncan that gold is the sole reward he can expect. As a peasant by birth, there is no possibility he would escape punishment for murdering the marquis and seizing his lands.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}Duncan flares up upon registering these words. His previously calm and phlegmatic eyes now brim with undisguised disdain.
{cps=50}After a moment of silence, Duncan shrugs and says that if you perceive him as a bandit, then he will behave as one.{vspace=5}Perhaps that will teach you something.
{cps=50}For example, that, as a guest of the house, you should at the very least show respect to your host.
{cps=50}Whereupon Duncan orders his men to dispose of you.
{cps=50}You attempt to flee, but Duncan's men swiftly encircle you from all directions, blocking all avenues of escape.
{cps=50}Duncan's men disarm you, then bind your hands and feet before dragging you to a clearing in the woods nearby, where they drop you on the ground.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Equipment lost!
{cps=50}Predictably, one of the bandits leans over you and brings a dagger to your throat. You know very well where this is going...
{cps=50}You beg for mercy.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 25!{vspace=5}Prestige lowered by 1!
{cps=50}Luckily for you, among Duncan's men tasked with disposing of you is Jones, who convinces his comrades not to take your life. Instead, he suggests letting you free for a ransom.
{cps=50}The ransom is set at 2500 florins. Before releasing you, Jones makes you promise that you will return with the money to pay him.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [ransom.name!ti].
{cps=50}Back in London, you provide Northampton with a report on your journey to Chippenham.
{cps=50}The earl is dissatisfied with the lack of results, but his anger quickly turns to concern upon learning that the marquis has fallen at the hands of bandits.
{cps=50}Sadly, this is not a fairy tale with a happy ending, and your throat is unceremoniously slit with a dagger.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Throat slit!
{cps=50}Though your life hangs by a thread, you staunchly refuse to beg for mercy...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 25!{vspace=5}Prestige increased by 1!
{cps=50}...so you meet your demise with honor.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Throat slit!
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Despite bleeding profusely for nearly an hour, you have somehow managed to hold onto life. Just as the last bit of your vitality was about to fade away, a group of peasants gathering firewood stumble upon your half-dead body.
{cps=50}After administering first aid, they provide you with shelter for a few more days until you regain enough strength to journey back to London on your own.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Once back in the capital, you immediately report to Northampton.
{cps=50}The earl is dissatisfied with the lack of results, but his anger quickly turns to concern when he sees the state that you're in.
{cps=50}You arrive in Chippenham to hire people...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ten militiamen hired!{vspace=5}400 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough men!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Five militiamen hired!{vspace=5}200 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough men!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}One militiaman hired!{vspace=5}40 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough men!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}You meet with Jones in a secluded place near Chippenham.
{cps=50}You hand over the promised sum.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}2500 florins lost.
{cps=50}Having fulfilled your promise, you are about to go on your way when, in a fit of unexpected frankness, Jones claims that he isn't entirely content working for Duncan...
{cps=50}...and wouldn't mind serving someone else, not just alone, but alongside a dozen or two comrades — seasoned ruffians and adventurers.
{cps=50}When you inquire about the cause of his discontent, Jones responds that despite assisting Duncan in dethroning the old marquis, the bandit leader has failed to deliver on promises made to him and his associates.
{cps=50}Therefore, many of Duncan's men, who had joined him solely for the chance to get rich, are now unhappy with the terms of employment.
{cps=50}Jones reacts to your offer with apprehension. {w}{vspace=5}Though he appreciates the promise of a good salary, the idea of going to war doesn't really excite him.
{cps=50}But as soon as you let him know that it's not about 'good money', but rather about 'very good money', his expression shifts.
{cps=50}But once you assure him that, along with a salary, he will also have the opportunity to plunder Windsor for spoils, his expression changes.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue is reduced by 50!
{cps=50}With the caveat that he, as a leader, won't be diving into the fray himself, Jones accepts your proposal.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You can hire Jones and his people in Chippenham.
{cps=50}Having fulfilled your promise, you bid farewell to Jones and head back.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}For 2,000 florins, Jones and ten of his comrades are ready to join the loyalist forces besieging Windsor.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ten militiamen hired!{vspace=5}2,000 florins lost!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}One evening, as you return to the royal residence following some business in the city, you notice an unknown person preparing to fire a crossbow bolt at you.
{cps=50}Fortunately, your reflexes don't fail you. You manage to take cover before the assassin fires the shot.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility, Coordination - success!
{cps=50}You don't react in time, and the bolt pierces your flesh.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility, Coordination — fail!
{cps=50}Although the bolt didn't hit any vital areas, you observe the flesh around your wound darkening...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality lowered by 5!{vspace=5}Toxicity increased!
{cps=50}Your eyes frantically search for your would-be killer, but he has already disappeared into the maze of streets.
{cps=50}Upon arriving in Bristol, you effortlessly locate a fleet of Italian vessels docked in the city's port.
{cps=50}The ships, however, are isolated from the rest, and there's no indication that their crews are in any hurry to unload them.
{cps=50}As you prepare to board one of them, you decide to adopt the identity of a knight in the service of Count Canterbury....
{cps=50}Your appearance inspires respect, and the sailors take you seriously.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!
{cps=50}Your appearance doesn't inspire confidence in the sailors. They tell you to get lost.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige - fail (required: 65)!
{cps=50}As you mull the idea of boarding by force, you notice just in time that, in addition to the sailors, a group of well-armed condottieri is also guarding the ship.
{cps=50}You have no choice but to turn back.
{cps=50}You are immediately introduced to the first mate, who escorts you to an opulent cabin.
{cps=50}You expect to meet the captain inside, but instead you are greeted by a merchant adorned in silks and luxurious brocade, with a hefty gold chain around his neck.
{cps=50}After exchanging greetings, he informs you that he has fully fulfilled his end of the bargain and is ready to provide Lord Canterbury with everything he has asked for, and then some.
{cps=50}For a proper fee, of course.
{cps=50}The merchant accompanies you into the hold, where a vast selection of weapons and equipment — some of exceptional quality — awaits.
{cps=50}Vaguely recalling legends about Italian gunsmiths and their craftsmanship, you casually ask the merchant if he has anything 'out of the ordinary' in store.
{cps=50}Smirking coyly, he replies that he has long awaited this question and is delighted to have finally found a connoisseur of Italian weaponry.{w} He boasts that he has a 'special something' reserved specifically for such occasions.
{cps=50}A very, very expensive 'special something'.
{cps=50}When you inquire about the contents of the hold of the second ship, the merchant informs you that it too is full — not of weapons, but of something far more... exotic.
{cps=50}All merchandise is available for sale. However, although he's willing to exchange weapons and gear for gold, the contents of the second ship will require a different form of payment.
{cps=50}Such is tradition.
{cps=50}In response to your inquiry about the nature of the payment, the merchant says exactly four words.
{cps=50}A pound of flesh.
{cps=50}Your flesh.
{cps=50}Having obtained what he desired, the merchant shows you the contents of the second ship's hold.
{cps=50}You refuse, to which the merchant just shrugs.
{cps=50}After thanking the merchant, you bid farewell to him and head back to London.
{cps=50}Scouts report numerous rebel groups advancing towards Cambridge. They advise postponing the journey due to the current circumstances.
{cps=50}You arrive at the court of the Duke of Cambridge, but he refuses to receive you.
{cps=50}You learn from reliable sources that the duke is closely monitoring the events at Windsor and is inclined to support the winner.
{cps=50}You arrive at the court of the Duke of Cambridge, but he refuses to receive you.
{cps=50}You learn from reliable sources that the loss of Windsor has dealt massive reputational damage to the loyalists. Most lords now believe that your defeat is inevitable.
{cps=50}Despite rumors of numerous rebel groups operating in the area, you manage to reach Cambridge without incident.
{cps=50}Before your eyes appears a densely populated city surrounded by a formidable fortified wall, in the center of which you can see the imposing residence of the duke.
{cps=50}Sire, my name is...
{cps=50}Sire, I came here on behalf of...
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Sir, Prince Edward and Earl Northampton wrote a letter to you. I am here to deliver it.
{cps=50}An old friend?
{cps=50}An old friend.
{cps=50}What the devil..!?{w}{vspace=5}How many times do I have to kill you to finally send you to hell!?
{cps=50}No more games, snotnose.
{cps=50}You've had plenty of chances to kill me, yet all you've managed to do is leave me a few scratches.
{cps=50}This time, scratches won't stop me.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The duke, who is enthusiastically watching all of this unfold, does not even try to hide his smirk.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The duke unfolds the parchment and begins to read, his eyes swiftly scanning the lines.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The mocking and dismissive expression on his face slowly gives way to genuine surprise, as his eyebrows shoot up towards his forehead.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After finishing reading, he stows the parchment away and gives you a long, thoughtful look.{w}{vspace=5}A wry smile stretches across his face.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Covered with wounds and slowly bleeding out, Roger attempts to move his lips.
{cps=50}I will... be back...
{cps=50}When I say goodbye, it's forever, Roger.
{cps=50}Goodbye.{w}{vspace=5}And burn in Hell.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Having learned from past experiences, you decide to leave nothing to chance. You drive a dagger straight into his heart.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The breathing stops, and his only eye closes. Now to never be opened again.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The duke unfolds the parchment and begins to read, his eyes swiftly scanning the lines.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The mocking and dismissive expression on his face slowly gives way to genuine surprise, as his eyebrows shoot up towards his forehead.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After finishing reading, he stows the parchment away and gives you a long, thoughtful look.{w}{vspace=5}A wry smile stretches across his face.
{cps=50}Back in London, you provide Northampton with a report on your journey to Cambridge.
{cps=50}Sire, the Duke of Cambridge is ready to take our side, but only on his own terms.
{cps=50}In addition to everything that was promised to him in the letter, the duke also wants Prince Edward to break off his engagement and marry his daughter instead.
{cps=50}What a scoundrel. But that was to be expected. A count who doesn't want to become a duke is a bad count.
{cps=50}But a duke who doesn't want to become a king, or at least turn his grandson into one, is even worse.{w}{vspace=5}So these demands of his aren't exactly news.
{cps=50}But that's not all, sire.{w} He also wants you to...
{cps=50}Wants me to do what?{w}{vspace=5}Marry his other daughter? Come visit his wife?
{cps=50}Once the rebels are defeated, he wants you to abandon all your posts and permanently leave the royal court to settle down somewhere far away from the capital.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}These words elicit an immediate reaction from Northampton. For the first time since you've met him, you see the veneer of phlegmatic calmness slip from his countenance, unveiling cold, ruthless anger.
{cps=50}Is that so?
{cps=50}Do you know what's the most important thing when it comes to high-stakes gambling, [name]?{w} Knowing when to quit.
{cps=50}If you push a man hard enough, he might give you some ground. But only to a point.{w}{vspace=5}Once that line is crossed, he will inevitably start pushing back.
{cps=50}It looks like the duke does not understand this.{w}{vspace=5}That means I might have to teach him another lesson.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}You can go now, [name]. We did everything we could. Now the only thing left for us to do is wait.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You've got many questions for the mayor, but you decide to handle the outpost inspection first.
{cps=50}Despite the desperate state of affairs in the city and the chaos raging outside the residence, you find the mayor in the same place as last time — in a dark office.
{cps=50}Alone at his desk, he sits in silence, the candle on his desk unlit.
{cps=50}The darkness enveloping the office prevents you from discerning his expression.
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}Your arrival fails to elicit any reaction from him. You have to start the conversation first.
{cps=50}Sire, my fears have been confirmed — the enemy has approached the walls of York.{vspace=5}{w}I hope the city's fortifications are in better condition than the northern outposts.
{cps=50}You may hate to admit it, but it's time to face reality.
{cps=50}If we want to save the city, then it's time to get to work.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}The Scots are under the city walls, sire! What the hell are you talking about!?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}There's nothing for you to discuss with the mayor.
{cps=50}Before departing, you suddenly recall that you haven't even had a proper meal since your arrival in York.
{cps=50}Upon further reflection, you find nothing better to do than to pay another visit to Lina.{vspace=5}She generously treats you to her cooking, which turns out to be surprisingly delicious.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality increased by 1!
{cps=50}Though you'd rather not embark on a journey in the rain, duty compels you onward, and thus, you head northward.
{cps=50}Navigating by the map received from the mayor's men, you reach the first outpost after about three hours of travel.
{cps=50}Upon arriving at the purported 'outpost', you realize that all that remains are a few dilapidated fortifications. Not a soul lingers amidst these ruins.
{cps=50}A cursory inspection of the abandoned fortifications yields nothing. You continue on to the next outpost.
{cps=50}You see gentle fumes rising from the location of the second outpost. Your hope swells as you draw closer to the barricades and see a group of armed men huddled around a cooking fire outside.
{cps=50}The joy of meeting them, however, is short-lived. As soon as you introduce yourself, the men immediately draw their weapons.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Clearly outmatched, the surviving enemies drop their weapons and flee.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Having emerged victorious, you venture into the outpost for an inspection. It becomes apparent that it too lies deserted, serving solely as a refuge for bandits and wanderers.
{cps=50}No sign of military activities can be found here.{vspace=5}The mayor's stories about the locked-down northern border are starting to look less and less credible.
{cps=50}However, the third and outermost outpost shatters whatever hope you've built up since departing from the second outpost.{vspace=5}{w}White and blue Scottish banners flutter about over the fortifications.
{cps=50}Upon careful observation you discern that the Scottish force that captured the outpost is quite small and likely wouldn't put up much of a fight.{vspace=5}You also notice a few prisoners in shackles.
{cps=50}Your military experience tells you that a swift assault may take the enemy by surprise, providing you with an opportunity to free the captives.{vspace=5}But is the risk justified?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}With the battle turning against you, you choose to withdraw. Although your rescue attempt was unsuccessful, you've done all you could.
{cps=50}To your dismay, you discover that the enemy forces are greater in number than you anticipated. What you envisioned as a 'blitz attack' becomes a prolonged and bloody battle.
{cps=50}Suddenly, the enemy soldiers disperse, clearing a path for a towering warrior. Advancing towards you, he speaks...
{cps=50}Agreed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Scared? No. Just a little confused.{vspace=5}{w}It's not every day that a man in a skirt asks me to take off my clothes...
{cps=50}I'm not sure if I'm fond of that idea.
{cps=50}Whatever you say, pal.{w}{vspace=5}I don't judge.
{cps=50}Spending time 'one-on-one' with men in skirts is not exactly my thing.
{cps=50}We all have our tastes, pal.{w}{vspace=5}I don't judge.
{cps=50}Standing firm under Wallace's barrage of blows, you find a gap in his defense and deliver a precise strike, fatally wounding him.
{cps=50}Sinking to his knees and clutching his gaping wound, he attempts to rise several times, but to no avail.
{cps=50}Realizing that his end is near, Wallace, with the last bit of his strength, hands you his sword and says...
{i}To be a warrior is to live forever.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Clearly outmatched, the surviving enemies drop their weapons and flee.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Faithful to the agreement made between you and Wallace, the Scottish soldiers allow you to rescue the captured soldiers and leave unharmed.
{cps=50}The road back ends up being uneventful.
{cps=50}After dealing with the Scottish soldiers, you free the prisoners and hastily make your way back to York.
{cps=50}The road back ends up being uneventful.
{cps=50}Upon returning to York, you head straight to the mayor, hoping to receive some kind of explanation regarding what you witnessed at the outposts.
{cps=50}You find him seated quietly in a dark office — lit by a solitary candle flickering on the table. Divination cards are laid out on a massive table in front of him, completely absorbing his attention.
{cps=50}Your sudden arrival appears to catch him off guard. He reluctantly lifts his gaze from his cards, not even attempting to hide his annoyance.
{cps=50}I hate to disappoint you, mayor, but what I saw in the north was exactly the opposite of what you described me.
{cps=50}The outposts are deserted. Those closest to the city are overrun with bandits, while the farthest ones have been seized by the Scots.
{cps=50}Sire, I don't think you quite comprehend the gravity of the situation...
{cps=50}Finding Eldham, as Lina promised, turns out to be quite easy. But trouble is never far behind.
{cps=50}As it happens, the village is teeming with armed men. You observe them pulling people out of their homes, tying them, and throwing them into large, mobile cages.
{cps=50}As you approach, several horsemen block your path. Among them, you are astonished to recognize Arthur de Rosamund.
{cps=50}What's going on? What are you doing with these people?
{cps=50}A 'fair' trial with a predetermined decision? Doesn't sound that fair to me.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You feel your anger slowly building. You make one last effort to avoid a direct confrontation.
{cps=50}I need to talk to one of the locals. His name is Conrad the Hunter. He might know the location of the Scottish forces.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As you take a closer look at the cages, you notice that each of them is already holding roughly half a dozen people. You loudly call out the name of Lina's father.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}One of the captured peasants immediately responds, turning to you and begging you to free him.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You return to Arthur.
{cps=50}I found him. I need him alive.{vspace=5}{w}Tell your men to let him go.
{cps=50}It appears your hearing is a bit dull as well, Arthur. Let me tell you one more time too: that man may possess valuable information that could decide the fate of the city.
{cps=50}He alone knows the location of the Scottish army.{vspace=5}{w}I need him alive.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}I'm taking him with me, Arthur. Whether you like it or not.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Arthur observes silently, a smile playing on his lips, as you systematically slaughter the mayor's henchmen, one after another. Only when the last one of them falls does he finally seem to come to life.
{cps=50}Jumping off his horse, he takes off his gloves and cloak and, drawing his sword, takes a step towards you.
{cps=50}However, this showdown is just not to be. A horseman appears out of nowhere and interrupts your duel before it can even begin. Judging by his attire, it's evident he's another one of the mayor's men.
{cps=50}After dismounting from his saddle, the newcomer approaches Arthur and whispers something into his ear. Something that causes an immediate change in his expression.
{cps=50}He sheathes his sword, picks up the cloak that he has dropped on the ground, and jumps back on his horse.
{cps=50}I have no clue what you're doing, but I promise: I will bring you all to light.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}As soon as Arthur vanishes over the horizon, you release the caged peasants, bringing joy to the entire village. You single out Conrad in order to question him.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}As Lina said, the old hunter turns out to be an unusually observant individual. He provides a thorough account, detailing not only the location where he spotted the Scots — a sizable lake located a half-day's journey to the northwest of Eldham — but also their numbers and weapons.
{cps=50}When Conrad finishes his story, you have no doubt that a full-fledged invasion is underway and that the Scots will reach the city any day now.
{cps=50}Armed with this hopefully valuable information, you set off back to York. Before you can progress far, a rider emerges from the direction you're headed — a messenger from the sergeant's troops.
{cps=50}You already know what he's about to say before he even opens his mouth. After all, there's only one reason for his arrival here.
{cps=50}{i}—The Scots have approached York. The city is under siege.
{cps=50}Brandishing a white flag, you head to the Scottish camp to request a meeting with the leader of their army.
{cps=50}You are escorted to a large, luxuriously furnished tent, where you are left alone, guarded by a few soldiers.
{cps=50}Fifteen minutes later, just as your patience begins to wear thin, a young man clad in ornate armor finally enters the tent.
{cps=50}They are both retired.
{cps=50}My name is [name], [player_full_title!ti]. As I've already stated, I have come here on the order of King Edward, with full authorization to speak and act on his behalf.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}......{vspace=5}{w}...
{cps=50}Please forgive my rudeness, your majesty.
{cps=50}I'm here to avoid bloodshed. Scottish forces have crossed our borders, bringing fire and sword to our lands. We don't know what caused this hostility, but it's not too late to resolve this misunderstanding at the negotiation table rather than on the battlefield.
{cps=50}If this is true, then let us follow the dictates of the law.{vspace=5}The mayor will be placed under arrest and taken to London, where he will confront the evidence against him.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}The assault on York will cost hundreds of lives on both sides. You came here to demand answers for the deaths of innocents, but instead of upholding justice, you now threaten to spill more innocent blood.
{cps=50}Is there really no way to save the city?
{cps=50}I agree to these conditions, but you have to give me time. At least some.
{cps=50}As you approach the prison, you notice plumes of smoke rising above the building.
{cps=50}Upon entering the courtyard, you see about half a dozen guards hauling out stacks of parchment and tossing them into a roaring bonfire.
{cps=50}In response to your question - what's going on? - the warden replies that shortly after the arrival of the Scots, they received an order from Seigneur de Rosamund to burn the archived records.
{cps=50}Perplexed by such a decision, you wonder whether there was anything important within these documents.{vspace=5}The warden shrugs his shoulders in response and points to a large pile of parchments nearby. He invites you to find out the answer to your question on your own.
{cps=50}You take a few parchments from the stack at random and begin sifting through them. One of them is a report from about two years ago; it details the capture and subsequent detention of a dangerous band of outlaws involved in kidnapping and ritual murder near the city. Signed beneath the report is 'Milton Dale, Jr., Captain of the Guard'.
{cps=50}Another parchment contains a detailed list of all those arrested, along with their names, origins, charges against them, and the dates of execution.
{cps=50}According to the document, all those arrested were executed within a month of their capture.{vspace=5}All but one. The last entry on the list had blank spots in the 'name' and 'sentence' fields.
{cps=50}Returning to the stack of parchments on the ground, you retrieve another bundle to inspect.
{cps=50}Among the papers lies a document detailing a guilty verdict against Milton Dale, Jr., a former captain of the guard. He was convicted of heresy, treason, and conspiracy to overthrow the city.
{cps=50}His conviction resulted in a death sentence, which was carried out a year and a half ago.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}......{vspace=5}{w}...
{cps=50}You find the contents of the archives fascinating, but you're too pressed for time to explore them further.
{cps=50}Tossing the parchments aside, you ask the warden about the identity of the prisoner held on the lowest floor.
{cps=50}After a long pause, he reluctantly replies that no one except the mayor and Seigneur de Rosamund knows this. The latter, incidentally, gave clear instructions to not let you in there again.
{cps=50}In response, you make it even clearer that you intend to go down — with or without the seigneur's permission.
{cps=50}Seeing that there's no convincing you, the warden orders that you be allowed passage.
{cps=50}Armed with a torch, you descend into the depths of the prison. The flights of stairs you traverse feel endless, and soon you lose count of their number.
{cps=50}The journey downward takes considerably longer than you recall from your previous visit, but the stairs do come to an end eventually, bringing you to the same place as last time.
{cps=50}In measured steps, you follow a long and narrow corridor flanked by rows of vacant cells.{vspace=5}Until you come face-to-face with a massive iron-studded door secured with a thick bolt.
{cps=50}You quickly unlock the door and make your way inside.{vspace=5}{w}Beneath the flickering flames of your torch, lies a corpse.
{cps=50}A skeletal figure clad in rags has breathed its last on the cell floor.{vspace=5}{w}Mayor Dale.
{cps=50}Judging by the severe emaciation of his body, you infer that the mayor has been here for at least a few months. Perhaps even longer.{vspace=5}{w}Much longer.
{cps=50}Once again, answers slip through your grasp, leaving only intrigues in their wake.{w} There now exists only one place within the city where you might gain some clarity on the issue.
{cps=50}The office of the 'mayor', of course, or whoever is impersonating him.
{cps=50}The fact that the gates of his residence are closed shut only reinforces your conviction that you're on the right track — perhaps for the first time since your arrival in York.{vspace=5}That's the good news.
{cps=50}The bad news is that you have to enter the residence by force.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Killing everyone in your path and leaving a trail of corpses behind you, you finally arrive at the mayor's office.{vspace=5}{w}You kick down the door without hesitation.
{cps=50}As usual, you find the mayor seated at his desk. A single candle casts dim light in the room, casting ugly shadows on his face.
{cps=50}To the left of the mayor, nearly shrouded in darkness, stands Arthur.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ignoring Arthur, you address the mayor directly.
{cps=50}I saw the prisoner that you're hiding. I know about the kidnappings and what caused the Scots to show up.{vspace=5}{w}Explain yourself.
{cps=50}Otherwise, I'll deliver you to the Scots.
{cps=50}Dead or alive.
{cps=50}Who are you? What have you done to the mayor?{vspace=5}{w}What is going on?
{cps=50}You're insane.
{cps=50}I can see it clear as day.
{cps=50}I've heard enough.
{cps=50}In the name of the king, I sentence both of you to death.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Having dealt with both, you try to remove the mask from the person — or rather, the creature — posing as the mayor.{vspace=5}{w}The contraption refuses to give way, as if firmly glued to the face.
{cps=50}In frustration, you use your dagger to carve the mask off the corpse, leaving what's left of its face completely unrecognizable.
{cps=50}The mask, drenched in warm blood, turns out to be pleasantly weighty. Repulsive at first glance, the mask now lying in your hands seems harmlessly ordinary.{vspace=5}Elegant, even.
{cps=50}Gazing into the viscous black void of its empty eye sockets, you do not notice the sun rising on the horizon. Only when the first rays of light break through the office window, caressing your face, do you take your eyes off the mask.
{cps=50}As you peer outside of the window, you notice that the permanent rain has stopped and clouds have dispersed. Golden warmth now fills the room.
{cps=50}But there's no time to bask in your triumph. A series of powerful blows rattles the city walls, causing the floor to tremble under your feet.{vspace=5}As King James promised, the Scots have begun their assault at dawn.
{cps=50}You think fast and hard, straining your brain to come up with a plan — or at least something remotely like it.
{cps=50}What would Northampton do? What would King Edward suggest? What advice would the sergeant give?
{cps=50}The answer to all these questions manifests as another earth-shattering barrage from enemy trebuchets.
{cps=50}Realizing that there is no time to think or to get help, you resort to the only solution.
{cps=50}Since there's no way to delay the assault or to repel it, the only thing left for you to do is try to stop it in its tracks.
{cps=50}There is only one person who can stop the attack. Which means you have to get to him. At any cost.
{cps=50}Climbing the ramparts, you gain a clear view of King James and his entourage. Standing at the head of his forces under one of the siege towers, James, clad in his resplendent armor, seems unperturbed by the chaos unfolding around him.
{cps=50}You deftly maneuver through the combatants and fallen bodies, slipping out of the city through a small side gate positioned at the flank of the Scottish king. Now within striking distance of the king, you tighten your grip around your weapon and charge forward.
{cps=50}There is not even a remote chance of success in this suicide mission. Your only hope is that the York militia can buy you enough time to break through the king's retinue.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Having broken through the troops that rallied to their king, you find yourself face to face with his personal retinue...
{cps=50}I am not here to kill you, sire.{vspace=5}{w}I am here to accept your terms.
{cps=50}Presenting the mask as evidence to support your assertions, you recount to James the events of the night before.
{cps=50}The king listens to you intently. When you're done talking, he orders one of his men to go to the South Gate and report on the progress of the assault.
{cps=50}The messenger returns fifteen minutes later, reporting that no significant progress has been made. Upon learning this, the king orders a retreat.
{cps=50}Thank you, sire.
{cps=50}James points at the mask.
{cps=50}I don't think they will like these terms in London, sire.{vspace=5}But I'm not in a position to argue, am I?
{cps=50}Did he really say that? 'A berserk old fart'?
{cps=50}His words exactly.
{cps=50}Hmm...{vspace=5}This is the sad reality, I guess. You embark on your final campaign, risk your life for the hundredth time, fight against guys who are half your age and twice as fit...
{cps=50}And this is what you get? They're calling you 'a berserk old fart'...{vspace=5}{w}Young people have no respect nowadays.
{cps=50}I'd take that as a compliment if I were you.{vspace=5}Considering that you're about to retire, that 'berserk' part might lose its relevance. Guess what that will leave you with?
{cps=50}In a couple of years you'll be missing these days.
{cps=50}Buy me another pint, and I'll pretend that I never heard that nonsense.
{cps=50}Drink as much as you want. When it comes to my friends, I'm a generous man.
{cps=50}Generous, indeed.{vspace=5}{w}Gave away the entire city treasury to the Scots...
{cps=50}Toasts to your health are probably being raised all over Scotland right now.
{cps=50}You're grumbling like an old man.{vspace=5}{w}You didn't even officially retire yet, and somehow it's already changing you for the worse.
{cps=50}I have a nice idea for your personal coat-of-arms. A fat and useless pelican!{w}{vspace=5}Wanna know why?
{cps=50}To your health, my friend.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After chugging another pint of ale, the sergeant wipes his mustache on his sleeve.
{cps=50}Alright, it's all clear with me. My warring days are over; it's time to settle down and retire.{vspace=5}But what about you? What's next for [name]?
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}Well, there's this girl...
{cps=50}Of course.{vspace=5}I could've bloody guessed.

{cps=50}A knight, then, eh? In Earl Northampton's service? In that case, I beg your pardon, sire.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Olivia gestures for silence.
{cps=50}That's not the reason I summoned you. You have already more than proved your competence in military affairs, so I absolutely trust you on that front.
{cps=50}More than anyone.
{cps=50}The reason why I wanted you here has to do with another issue entirely.
{cps=50}I'm all ears.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Frowning and carefully choosing her words, Olivia starts talking.
{cps=50}Any ruler worth their salt, truly intent on securing their throne, must have eyes and ears everywhere.{vspace=5}Sometimes in the most unexpected places.
{cps=50}The unfortunate events of the recent months left me deaf and blind for a considerable stretch of time.
{cps=50}But, as soon as the safety of Rennes was secured, I immediately set about restoring my spy network...
{cps=50}...just in time to catch wind of rumors that evoke the utmost horror.
{cps=50}...?
{cps=50}On the road that stretches from Rennes' eastern gate, about halfway to Olivier's farm, there's a large wayside inn.
{cps=50}A popular place among merchants and caravanners traveling in and out of Rennes.
{cps=50}Not so long ago, two highly suspicious guests arrived at the inn and were seen snooping around, asking questions about things they aren't supposed to know and taking an interest in people they aren't supposed to be interested in.
{cps=50}Those who are eager to talk — they pay with gold.{vspace=5}Those who are not — they threaten with steel.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}They are here to kill me, [name].{vspace=5}{w}I can feel it.
{cps=50}Just tell me what to do, milady.
{cps=50}Make them disappear.{vspace=5}{w}Forever.
{cps=50}I will deal with them today, milady.
{cps=50}Just please be careful.{vspace=5}If even half of what I've heard about them is true, then you can't even imagine how dangerous they are.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [grace_and_glory.name!ti].
{cps=50}I'll see what can be done.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [lobbyist.name!ti]!
{cps=50}Does that mean the rebels are now cut off from the alchemical supplies?
{cps=50}How much of the supplies did you manage to sell to the rebels?
{cps=50}What do you suggest?
{cps=50}I like the idea.
{cps=50}That is very nice to hear. I'll mark the warehouse on your map; it is located not far away from Onar's farm. But not exactly too close to it, either — to prevent the locals from sneaking inside, I guess.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [raid.name!ti].
{cps=50}Well good morning, sleepyhead!
{cps=50}Someone almost slept through all the fun!
{cps=50}Good morning, countess.{w} Did something happen?
{cps=50}It did. And it is something good for a change.
{cps=50}Last night, a group of bandits tried to loot an estate a few miles north of Dartford, but this time my men were ready.
{cps=50}The attack was repelled, but what's more is that we managed to capture one of the bandits alive.
{cps=50}Looks like we are in some serious luck.
{cps=50}Luck!? Are you serious?
{cps=50}I actually anticipated their attack on several locations, including that one. Once you've made sure that Dartford is safe, I was able to re-deploy its guards and have them set ambushes at strategic points.
{cps=50}Thus it's not thanks to luck, but rather thanks to my genius.
{cps=50}Well, a little bit thanks to you too.
{cps=50}Now let's talk about our new prisoner. He, as it turns out, is not much of a talker.
{cps=50}Since you're here, I suggest you do a little bit of persuasion. I have no doubt that you'll make him sing like a nightingale.
{cps=50}You want me to torture him?
{cps=50}No, I want you to have a friendly chat with him...{w} Of course I want you to torture him! How else are we supposed to extract any information out of him?
{cps=50}These filthy yokels with a mixture of mud and ale for blood dare to raise their filthy hands against us. Us! The nobility! This is unheard of and has to be stopped.
{cps=50}Last night, they showed up at the estate of Baron Warwick, but tomorrow it could easily be my home. Or yours. Or a home of anyone {b}among us{/b}.
{cps=50}These bastards and everyone who supports them must be reminded of their place. Honestly, I am surprised this even needs explaining.
{cps=50}Do whatever you want with him. Drown him in his own blood if you have to — but make him talk.
{cps=50}He'll tell me everything he knows. Even if I have to rip it out of him with red-hot steel.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue reduced by 15!
{cps=50}That's exactly what I wanted to hear.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 5!
{cps=50}That's my obedient knight.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}This unexpected and frankly barbaric request catches you off-guard, repulsing you to your very core.
{cps=50}Milady, I am a warrior, not an executioner or a torturer.
{cps=50}If I have to spill another man's blood, I would much rather do so in fair combat — when he is armed and stands face-to-face against me.
{cps=50}I'm not going to torture or disfigure some puny yokel just to extract information that would doom his comrades and tarnish whatever minuscule trace of honor he may possess.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Obviously surprised by this answer, the countess looks at you for a few seconds in total bewilderment.
{cps=50}Looks like we're having a misunderstanding.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}I've done my research on you.{w} And since I couldn't find any record of you being knighted in the London registry books...
{cps=50}...I can draw one of two conclusions.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You feel cold steel in her voice.
{cps=50}Either you're not who you say you are.{w} Which means there's nothing stopping me from ordering my men to execute you on the spot for impersonating an honorable nobleman.
{cps=50}Or, you've been knighted just recently and haven't yet realized that holding a noble title implies certain...{w} corporate solidarity.
{cps=50}It's a simple concept, [name]. There's {b}us{/b} and there's {b}them{/b}.
{cps=50}A king's job is to rule, a knight's job is to fight, a priest's job is to pray for the forgiveness of our sins.
{cps=50}And a peasant's job is to obediently serve without ever raising his head.
{cps=50}Their souls are tainted by avarice and envy. They will always loathe us because that's in their essence.
{cps=50}The very second they stop fearing us, their hatred will drive them to pick up arms against us.
{cps=50}Once that happens, whether you have treated them fairly or not wouldn't matter. You'd be beheaded along with everyone else — simply because you're not one of them.{w} Because you do not come from the same filth they do.
{cps=50}Because you're more virtuous than them.{w}Because you're better than them.
{cps=50}Because your blood is purer.
{cps=50}By killing those thugs in the Greenwich forests, you are protecting not only my estate but also your right to live the life you deserve.
{cps=50}You know it better than anyone that sometimes you have to fight for your right to live — and often not in the cleanest of ways.
{cps=50}When your opponent is a man of honor, you can deal with him according to the laws of honor.
{cps=50}But when a rootless, Devil-possessed mass of yokels rises up against you, rules and laws lose their relevance. For they themselves know none.
{cps=50}So I will say it one more time.{w} Do me a favor; pull yourself together and do what the situation calls for.
{cps=50}He'll tell me everything he knows. Even if I have to rip it out of him with red-hot steel.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue reduced by 15!
{cps=50}That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The countess' face again lights up with a carefree smile — a stark contrast to the words flying out of her lips.
{cps=50}Now go and torture him to death if you have to.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}In an instant, the faces of the comrades who fought alongside you in France flash before your eyes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}They were not barons, marquises, or nobles, but their lowly status did not prevent them from climbing impregnable walls under a hail of arrows, bolts, and stones. They did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives in a foreign land, many leagues from home, just to satiate somebody else's ambitions and protect somebody else's honor.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As rage builds within you, you feel your blood starting to boil.
{cps=50}Those vile, greedy, and envious yokels, whom you so despise, stood shoulder to shoulder with me under the walls of Cambrai.
{cps=50}Not so long ago I too was one of those people you despise so much. If you believe that ranks and titles will make me forget where I come from, you are severely mistaken.
{cps=50}However, I do not expect you to understand me.
{cps=50}Those born and raised on silk sheets, who've never known hunger or cold, will never understand that beyond the high walls of their castles and estates, there are people too. And they are the same as you.
{cps=50}True, the Lord might not have blessed them with fortune or noble blood, but that does not mean that they can be treated like cattle.
{cps=50}And, goddamn you, my honor will never allow me to torture an unarmed defenseless prisoner!
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}But what can you know about honor...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The last sentence escapes your lips involuntarily, and you instantly regret saying it.
{cps=50}Forgive me, countess, I didn't mean to...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Feeling that you may have gone too far, you try to make amends quickly, but Alyssa unceremoniously interrupts you. It appears she has no intention of hearing anything further you have to say.
{cps=50}My oh my...{w} And to think I even started making plans about you.
{cps=50}Father told me that worthy people are found only among noble families, but I, being a silly girl, didn't believe him.
{cps=50}He was right yet again.
{cps=50}I have already told you that there is no place for cowards and slobs in my house.{w} But also there is no place for filth.
{cps=50}Get out of my face, or I will order my men to tie you up and throw you into the cellar. So you can keep good company to that yokel friend of yours.
{cps=50}And if you ever dare to show up at Greenwich again, I'll have your head chopped off and put on a pike for everyone to see.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) lowered by 150!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Someone's in for a very interesting talk with the earl and the prince...{vspace=5}Quest updated — [genius_idea.name!ti].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You find Alyssa focusing on a map. When she sees you, she gets straight to the point — without greeting you.
{cps=50}Here. This place should be somewhere around here...
{cps=50}To be honest, I still can't believe that we're about to finally catch that scoundrel.
{cps=50}Just a couple of weeks ago, he and his men had the entire area shaking in terror, but now it's us who have got them by the throat.
{cps=50}...and the best part is: they don't even realize it yet.
{cps=50}Hold your horses, milady. Don't start celebrating too soon.
{cps=50}If this Duncan fella really is at least half as dangerous as you've described him, then this is far from over.
{cps=50}He is bloodthirsty and resourceful, but his strategic acumen extends only to setting up crude ambushes.
{cps=50}He and his men are no match for you.
{cps=50}My people are ready to march and await only for your command. Go and put an end to this story.
{cps=50}I will pray for you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [robbin_the_hood.name!ti].
{cps=50}Congratulations on another victory.
{cps=50}Call that intuition, luck, or anything else, but I know a hawk from a handsaw.
{cps=50}One glance at you was enough for me to tell that you're exactly the man who can and will bring law and order back to Greenwich.
{cps=50}Exactly the man I need.
{cps=50}Thank you, milady.
{cps=50}That bastard Duncan is awaiting his fate in an iron cage. Half of his men have been slain, and the rest captured. The bandits are no more.
{cps=50}Looks like Greenwich can finally sleep peacefully now.
{cps=50}You have no idea how grateful I am to you. The events of the past few months have turned my life into one endless nightmare from which I could never awaken.
{cps=50}Now, at last, I am awake. All the horrors are gone like a bad dream.
{cps=50}It's all thanks to you.{w} Thank you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 30!
{cps=50}The code of honor compels me to aid a fair lady...{w} Especially one as fair as you are.
{cps=50}No. No more ladies. You can call me Alyssa now.
{cps=50}As you say... Alyssa.
{cps=50}Well now, I too remember my promise. In all honesty, I'm not particularly excited about the young prince's ambitious endeavor.
{cps=50}My father, in his time at the royal court, was no stranger to intrigues and conspiracies around the throne. According to him, these machinations taught him a simple lesson.
{cps=50}As long as your head is still on your shoulders, you can consider yourself a winner. And as long as you are a winner, it's never too late to back out of anything that is looking too risky.
{cps=50}I...
{cps=50}Shut up. I know everything.
{cps=50}If you were a man who backed out at the first sign of risk, you wouldn't be standing here right now.
{cps=50}You can count on my help.
{cps=50}Thanks.{w} I...
{cps=50}Didn't I tell you to shut up!?
{cps=50}Even my limited understanding of military strategy tells me that the prince doesn't have any more time to waste.{vspace=5}And neither do you.
{cps=50}There's no guarantee that I will ever see you again.
{cps=50}So I suggest you don't waste our precious time talking...{w} And instead help me get out of this dress.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [genius_idea.name!ti]!{vspace=5}You can now recruit Count Caldwell's men.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have received a gift from Alyssa.
{cps=50}Having been informed by Alyssa of your visit, he wastes no time in bringing you up to speed.
{cps=50}Duels are conducted according to strict rules, the violation of which is punishable by dishonor and universal censure. To name all of the rules would take too long, so here are the key ones you should remember.
{cps=50}In battle, only pre-agreed weapons can be used: if both duelists agree to fight with swords, then the duel shall be conducted with swords. Axes or spears, for example, would not be allowed.
{cps=50}It is forbidden to use poison or poisonous potions.
{cps=50}It is forbidden to use crossbows or bows.
{cps=50}The first duel continues until the death or surrender of one of the duelists, or until time runs out.
{cps=50}The second duel has no time limit and continues until the death or surrender of one of the duelists.
{cps=50}During the break, duelists are required to replace their weapons with ones that meet the stipulated conditions of the second duel.
{cps=50}During the break, duelists can replace broken or damaged shields and other pieces of equipment.
{cps=50}During the break, duelists can receive first aid. However, serious injuries cannot be healed.
{cps=50}Duelists can rest and recuperate as much as they can between fights.
{cps=50}At last! You sure did take your time.
{cps=50}What's new?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You recount to Alyssa the details of your trip to the sheriff.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Despite only being able to explore one room, you managed to see quite a lot.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Strangely enough the countess doesn't seem all that surprised.
{cps=50}Good job, [name]. That's exactly what I thought. Everything suggests that the sheriff is conspiring with the bandits.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 5!
{cps=50}This unties our hands. It's about time we got rid of him.
{cps=50}How exactly are you planning to do that?
{cps=50}Erhm... I was under the impression that, between the two of us, you would be the one in charge of any... 'application of force'.
{cps=50}It's not me who has just returned from war, is it?
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Alright. If it's my call, then here's what we're going to do...
{cps=50}Bla-bla-bla. Did you honestly think that I would allow you to call the shots?
{cps=50}I've already set everything up. I sent a letter to the sheriff yesterday on your behalf. In the letter, you declare him a traitor to the crown and challenge him to a duel.{w} You also admit that you're sleeping with his wife.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The information you've gathered is more akin to a description of a visit to a good friend rather than a thorough investigation of a suspicious person's financial affairs.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}From Alyssa's expression, it is abundantly clear that she expected more out of you and is somewhat disappointed by the results of your mission.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}Alas, I'd be lying if I told you that I'm happy with the results.
{cps=50}God is my witness, this is not what I was expecting to hear when I sent the sheriff the challenge to a duel on your behalf.
{cps=50}You sent what to the sheriff?
{cps=50}A challenge to a duel. I was sure that you'd find proof of his involvement so I decided to, you know... speed things up a bit.
{cps=50}In the letter, you declare him a traitor to the crown and challenge him to a duel.{w} You also admit that you're sleeping with his wife.
{cps=50}Wha-a-a-t!?
{cps=50}What's wrong? Time is of the essence — I've already told you. I didn't see the point of dragging this out.
{cps=50}Honestly, I think you should be thanking me. I'm literally doing all the work while you can't even perform a basic task.{vspace=5}I even saved you the trouble of having to come up with a plan for the sheriff's assassination.
{cps=50}No cloaks, no daggers, no nonsense. Just an honorable duel.
{cps=50}Hopefully that will also make for a good spectacle.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Although, given that the sheriff is considered to be one of the finest duelists in the entire south of England, challenging him to single combat might not be the greatest idea after all.
{cps=50}That's an oops on my part. Might have rushed things a little bit...
{cps=50}Why are you so silent all of a sudden?
{cps=50}That's a lot of information you've just poured on me.
{cps=50}That's something I do. You'd better get used to it.
{cps=50}I also value obedience.
{cps=50}And you're an obedient knight, aren't you?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Despite Alyssa's distracting antics, you don't let yourself forget what brought you here in the first place.
{cps=50}Sure.
{cps=50}I'm happy to hear it. I like it when things are going my way.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 10!
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}......{w}{vspace=5}...
{cps=50}Am I?
{cps=50}This is not the type of thing I'm usually asked about.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Did you just blush?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 3!
{cps=50}No.
{cps=50}I think you did.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 3!
{cps=50}That's impossible.
{cps=50}I may be blind but I'm not tactless. Dammit! I meant the other way around — I may be tactless but I'm not blind!{vspace=5}You're red as a ripe tomato.
{cps=50}I almost wanna bite you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 3!
{cps=50}I said I'm not blushing! I'm just... concerned. Concerned, yes. About the sheriff - I had no idea he was the best duelist in this part of the kingdom.
{cps=50}There's no need to be concerned about the sheriff.{w} The man's got a wife, I remind you.
{cps=50}That is not what I meant!
{cps=50}I'm kidding.
{cps=50}But let me just say this: if you play your cards right, you might find yourself a wife soon.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 6!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Bewildered by this sudden burst of informality, you decide to let her know that you're not going to play by her rules.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}However, as you open your mouth to tell her off, all that escapes your lips is unintelligible gibberish.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Alyssa chooses to interpret your babbling in her own way.
{cps=50}Poor thing! Going too fast, are we? Alright, I'll hold my horses a bit.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Suddenly, a maid appears out of nowhere and hands Alyssa a sealed envelope. She then whispers something into the countess' ear before vanishing as swiftly as she had appeared.
{cps=50}Ah, here's the sheriff's reply. Swift as expected. Rushing to meet his own demise...
{cps=50}As my father likes to say:{i} When death comes knocking at your door, don't be in a hurry to answer.{/i}{w}{vspace=5}Let's see what the sheriff has to say.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Alyssa begins reading.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}...
{cps=50}On my, it looks like your words really got to him. Maybe even too much.
{cps=50}Particularly that part where you vividly describe your bedroom adventures with his wife.
{cps=50}I know her personally, by the way. She's a feisty one, for sure, but those things you wrote might have been too lewd even by her standards.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Alyssa goes back to reading.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}...
{cps=50}Yeah, yeah, yeah. This and that. It's the classics. Duel. One on one. Standard stuff.
{cps=50}The duel will consist of two stages. The first stage — with weapons of your choosing. The second — with his.
{cps=50}The first stage is to last for fifteen minutes. If you both make it out alive, the second stage will last...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}For a fleeting moment, Alyssa's expression shifts, and for the first time since you've known her, you can see a look of genuine concern on her face.
{cps=50}...last until the death of one of the duelists.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Don't even think about dying, got it?
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}The sheriff chooses swords. Both one- and two-handed ones are allowed.
{cps=50}Shields are optional.
{cps=50}The sheriff chooses axes. Both one- and two-handed ones are allowed.
{cps=50}Shields are optional.
{cps=50}The sheriff chooses bludgeoning weapons. All types of maces and warhammers are allowed.
{cps=50}Shields are optional.
{cps=50}The sheriff chooses spears.
{cps=50}Shields are optional.
{cps=50}The sheriff chooses halberds.
{cps=50}You will also need to choose a weapon.
{cps=50}I won't ask for your reply right away. Something tells me that you might need some time to think the decision over.
{cps=50}Tell me when you're ready, and I'll send a letter to the sheriff.
{cps=50}Meanwhile, go talk to Joffrey — my herald. He'll tell you all about the rules of the duel.
{cps=50}By the way, you can also pay a visit to the Greenwich armory — I'll tell my people to let you in. It's not the Tower, of course, but there might be something useful.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [mortal_combat.name!ti]!
{cps=50}Well... Are you ready?
{cps=50}Well hello-hello. Welcome back, mister hero.
{cps=50}You've become quite the talk of the town here in Greenwich lately. Everyone and their mother are talking about your victories over the bandits.
{cps=50}I have no clue how you're pulling all of this off, but the truth remains: I no longer feel as though my house is constantly under siege. For the first time in quite a while.
{cps=50}And it's a magnificent feeling.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 20!{vspace=5}150 florins received
{cps=50}I thank you for such high praise, milady.{vspace=5}You put any task before me, and I will get it done.
{cps=50}I love your approach.
{cps=50}If you continue to impress me this way, I'll have to seriously consider the idea of rewarding you with something more than gold.
{cps=50}What's our next move?
{cps=50}Now that we've done the sheriff's job for him, it's time we took care of the man himself.
{cps=50}We need to expose his shady affairs. If the bastard really helps the bandits, then there's no choice but to eliminate him.
{cps=50}But how can we know for sure if he's involved?
{cps=50}Relax. Your job is to swing a sword. I'll do the thinking for both of us.{w} I already have a plan.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The mere mention of the word 'plan' makes your eye twitch as Northampton's and Prince Edward's sly, grinning faces appear in your head.
{cps=50}You will go to his estate disguised as a tax collector and conduct a small... audit of his assets.
{cps=50}If he is really working with bandits, then he has to be paid more than a handful of florins. The money has to be big, enough to leave a trail. You'll just have to take a good sniff around his place.
{cps=50}Try to look convincing. If you show up at his doorstep dressed like a beggar, chances are they won't even let you in. As they say, you have to dress to impress.
{cps=50}Sounds doable.
{cps=50}Glad to hear it. Do not disappoint me.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [death_and_taxes.name!ti]!
{cps=50}Hello. Happy to see you again.
{cps=50}My men are at your service.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You and Alyssa don't have anything to talk about at the moment.
{cps=50}Happy to see you again, sire.
{cps=50}How's your search? Did you find the mayor?
{cps=50}I did.{vspace=5}But instead of bringing any clarity to the situation, he only further confused me.
{cps=50}He claims that there is no Scottish threat. Apparently, rumors about the invasion are nothing but falsehoods, fabricated and spread by local drunkards and fearmongers.
{cps=50}Oh well. I told you that he is a bit... off. The whole city is trembling with horror, and yet he refuses to acknowledge the reality of the situation.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}Tell me, Lina, did you...{w} Did you actually see any of those Scots yourself?
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Oh, Lord, sire — of course not! I don't wander around.
{cps=50}H-m-m.{vspace=5}{w}But you are convinced that they're here, right?
{cps=50}Certainly.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}With every minute spent in York, you find your grasp on reality getting weaker and weaker. There's no way to tell who's right and who's wrong.{vspace=5}{w}Who's lying and who isn't.
{cps=50}My father has seen them, sire!
{cps=50}He is a hunter and lives in Eldham, a small village not far from the city. I've told you before.
{cps=50}I saw him a couple of days ago when he came to visit me. He told me about the Scottish troops that he had spotted up north.
{cps=50}I see. In this case, I would like to have a word with him.{vspace=5}As soon as I'm done dealing with the outposts.
{cps=50}He will help you, I'm sure. He's got a very sharp eye; it's not for nothing that the folks call him the best hunter in the York area.
{cps=50}Although the years are catching up to him a bit. Sadly...
{cps=50}I'll come visit him in Eldham as soon as I'm done inspecting the outposts.
{cps=50}As you wish, sire. Let me know when you will be ready to depart. I'll give you the directions.
{cps=50}Sure.{w}{vspace=5}One more thing: you don't need to call me 'sire'.{vspace=5}You can call me by my name.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your words catch the girl off guard and immediately make her blush.
{cps=50}As you wish, s... I mean as you wish, [name].{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Lina) improved by 15!
{cps=50}Happy to see you again, s...{vspace=5}I mean, happy to see you again, [name].{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Lina) improved by 5!
{cps=50}Any news from the north?
{cps=50}Only bad. The outposts are abandoned. There's no defense against any advances towards the city.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}And what about the Scots?
{cps=50}I've seen a small group of them in the farthest outpost, but that's it.{vspace=5}The mayor claims it is just a small-scale raid.
{cps=50}But for some reason I am not convinced.
{cps=50}I believe you should find my father and ask him about what he saw.
{cps=50}This is exactly what I intend to do.{vspace=5}What's the name of the village again?
{vspace=5}Eldham. It's not far from the city; exit through the East Gate and continue along the road. Don't turn anywhere, and you should be there in a couple of hours.
{vspace=5}Once you arrive, just ask for Conrad the Hunter — everybody knows him.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [countryside.name!ti].
{cps=50}[name]! You're back!{vspace=5}{w}I was awfully worried...
{cps=50}I had this feeling that something terrible was about to happen. And of course it did...{w} Bad premonitions are always like this.
{cps=50}How's my father? Did you find him? Did the Scots reach the village?
{cps=50}I found him. He is safe.{vspace=5}{w}It wasn't the Scots who were the menace, though.
{cps=50}...?
{cps=50}When I arrived in Eldham, the place was crawling with the mayor's men. They were led by that pal of his — Arthur de Rosamund or whatever his name is.
{cps=50}They've arrested about a dozen or so of the villagers, including your father.{vspace=5}Those people, according to Arthur, were 'criminals to be tried and executed'.
{cps=50}Oh, Lord! This can't be!
{cps=50}My father would never commit any crime!
{cps=50}Indeed, it all seemed very suspicious. I tried to reason with Arthur but... Let's just say we didn't really see eye to eye.
{cps=50}In any case, I freed Conrad and the rest. They are out of danger for now.{vspace=5}If, of course, they were smart enough to get away from the Scots.
{cps=50}Thank you! Thank you so much.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Lina) improved by 30!
{cps=50}I am forever in your debt.
{cps=50}What are we supposed to do now?
{cps=50}Well, first of all, it is not safe for you to stay here.
{cps=50}But where would I go?{vspace=5}I don't have any other relatives around or even money for that matter.{vspace=5}Do you think I should go back to Eldham?
{cps=50}No, definitely not there. The village is practically within arm's reach of the city, so it's only a matter of time before Scottish soldiers or foragers show up there. Running into them is exactly the opposite of what you want to do.
{cps=50}But where to then?
{cps=50}You've got to leave the city and get as far away as possible. Far, far away.
{cps=50}I know what sieges are like. I know them all too well. No matter how daunting running away seems, you have to do it. Because what's coming will be far more dreadful than any perils you might encounter on the way.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}Do I have to... Do I have to go by myself?{vspace=5}I don't think I can. I don't even know where to go...
{cps=50}[player_squad_member1_full_name!ti] will go with you. He's a smart guy. I trust him.{vspace=5}He'll get you out of here.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[player_squad_member1_full_name!ti] left the party!
{cps=50}[player_squad_member2_full_name!ti] will go with you. He's a smart guy. I trust him.{vspace=5}He'll get you out of here.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[player_squad_member2_full_name!ti] left the party!
{cps=50}[player_squad_member3_full_name!ti] will go with you. He's a smart guy. I trust him.{vspace=5}He'll get you out of here.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[player_squad_member3_full_name!ti] left the party!
{cps=50}[player_squad_member4_full_name!ti] will go with you. He's a smart guy. I trust him.{vspace=5}He'll get you out of here.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[player_squad_member4_full_name!ti] left the party!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}No men in the squad!
{cps=50}We have to find someone who can help you escape the city.
{cps=50}Pack your things and wait for my signal. I'll speak with the sergeant to arrange your getaway.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [escape.name!ti].
{cps=50}For starters, you should probably relocate to an inn or something like that. It would be a lot safer than staying here.
{cps=50}I only know Aunt Freya's inn in the old part of town. We buy food from them sometimes.
{cps=50}I could stay there, I guess. I heard it's not the most expensive place.
{cps=50}But I probably won't scrape together even that much.
{cps=50}Don't worry about the money.{vspace=5}{w}How much is it?
{cps=50}Fifty florins should be more than enough for a couple of nights.
{cps=50}Here's the money.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}50 florins lost.
{cps=50}Don't waste any time; grab your stuff and get out of the residence.
{cps=50}I'll come find you as soon as I can.
{cps=50}Thank you!
{cps=50}I don't know why you are doing all of this for me, but I will never forget your kindness!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Lina) improved by 15!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}Here's the money.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}100 florins lost.
{cps=50}Don't waste any time; grab your stuff and get out of the residence.
{cps=50}I'll come find you as soon as I can.
{cps=50}Thanks!{vspace=5}But such a large sum is really not needed...
{cps=50}I don't know why you are doing all of this for me, but I will never forget your kindness!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Lina) improved by 20!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}Here's the money.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}500 florins lost.
{cps=50}Don't waste any time; grab your stuff and get out of the residence.
{cps=50}I'll come find you as soon as I can.
{cps=50}God, that's a fortune!{vspace=5}I've never seen so much money in my life — I simply can't accept such a sum!
{cps=50}Lina, don't waste your time on empty arguments and do as you're told.{vspace=5}Your life might depend on it.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}Thank you!
{cps=50}I don't know why you are doing all of this for me, but I will never forget your kindness!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Lina) improved by 25!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}I'll take care of it.{vspace=5}Pack up your things and get ready. I'll come get you.
{cps=50}How's your new place? Comfortable enough?
{cps=50}It's alright, thank you. I really do feel a lot calmer here. Maybe even safer.{vspace=5}{w}It's just weird to sit around doing nothing. I'm used to working from dawn till dusk, but here I just sit and sit...
{cps=50}Are there any news?{vspace=5}{w}The city is buzzing with rumors that some kind of negotiations with the Scots are taking place... Word has it that the city might be surrendered without a fight.
{cps=50}The Scots have brought a huge army, and the troops sent by King Edward will need at least one more week to arrive. If the Scots attack, we have almost no chance of repelling them.
{cps=50}Even if the city capitulates, a massacre might still be inevitable. They hunger for blood, primarily the mayor's, but they'll gladly spill anybody's.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Judging by the expression on Lina's face, she does not seem to be quite following you. You briefly fill her in on your conversation with King James, including his accusations against the mayor.
{cps=50}Perhaps I should not be saying this, but...
{cps=50}But maybe we should just hand the mayor over to them?{vspace=5}{w}If that will help save the city.
{cps=50}But we don't even know for sure if he's guilty.
{cps=50}You saw yourself what happened in Eldham: the same kind of kidnapping that the Scots were talking about.
{cps=50}Come to think of it, we've had our fair share of rumors about locals vanishing, while the prison continues to receive a steady stream of new criminals.
{cps=50}It never crossed my mind that these could be connected until now.
{cps=50}I remember being surprised at the number of people corralled by the guards. It was almost like a never-ending stream.{vspace=5}But over time everybody got used to seeing this, I guess.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As Lina keeps speaking, one of her words becomes lodged in your mind, capturing all of your attention.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The prison.{vspace=5}{w}The key to the puzzle from the very beginning.
{cps=50}The prison.{vspace=5}{w}Lina, who exactly do they keep in there? I mean, the prisoners in the dungeons on the lowest level?
{cps=50}I... I don't know. I told you that they were regularly bringing new people in there. Once a week at least. Sometimes even more.
{cps=50}These people were all said to be bandits or criminals or... Or some other scoundrels accused of witchcraft. These kinds of folks were always plentiful in the north.
{cps=50}At some point, the mayor started to regularly visit the prison himself. Usually with Seigneur de Rosamund...
{cps=50}It's time to find out who the hell they are hiding in there.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [heart_of_darkness.name!ti].
{cps=50}Promise me...{vspace=5}Promise me you will be careful...
{cps=50}Promise that you'll come back alive.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}I will do everything I can.
{cps=50}I'm not one to pretend I know what the future holds, but one thing I can say for sure: I definitely won't die there.{vspace=5}{w}The king didn't grant me a fine estate in the south just for me to die in this God-forsaken northern hole.
{cps=50}Hey! Watch it! It's my home that you're talking about.{vspace=5}{w}It is not a 'God-forsaken hole' in the slightest. There are countless beautiful places around here. How about the...
{cps=50}Of course there are. And I would love to hear you tell me all about them.
{cps=50}The next time we meet.
{cps=50}I will be thinking about you every minute.
{cps=50}Here's something for you. A small parting gift.
{cps=50}I may not be a countess or a duchess, but I've got my own perks.
{cps=50}Come back. I will be waiting.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You and Lina have nothing to talk about at the moment.
{cps=50}When do we depart?
{cps=50}The sooner you leave the city, the safer your journey will be.
{cps=50}This means...
{cps=50}This means you're leaving right now.
{cps=50}Will we...{vspace=5}Will we ever see each other again? Someday...
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}I will do everything I can to make that happen.
{cps=50}I'm not one to pretend I know what the future holds, but one thing I can say for sure: I definitely won't die there.{vspace=5}{w}The king didn't grant me a fine estate in the south just for me to die in this God-forsaken northern hole.

{cps=50}Of course there are. And I would love to hear you tell me all about them.

{cps=50}I will be thinking about you every minute.
{cps=50}Here's something for you. A small parting gift.
{cps=50}I may not be a countess or a duchess, but I've got my own perks.
{cps=50}Come back. I will be waiting.
{cps=50}I am happy to meet you, [name]. I believe I saw you just a little while ago. You were visiting my father on some business.
{cps=50}The social life for the nobility here in Outremer is not particularly exuberant. So I am always excited to see any new faces.
{cps=50}My name is Emma de Lusignan. I am the daughter of the governor of Damietta.
{cps=50}You strike me as a noble man. I would love to hear more about you and the journey that brought you here.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!{vspace=5}Relationship (Emma) improved by 15!
{cps=50}You strike me as a formidable warrior. I hope your arrival here is a good omen for us all.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — neutral result!{vspace=5}Relationship (Emma) improved by 5!
{cps=50}You probably came here as part of someone's retinue, didn't you?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — fail (required: 50)!
{cps=50}What brings you here — to the End of the World?
{cps=50}I am here at the request of a certain influential person — Bernard de Châtillon. He asked me to find and bring back his son Renauld...
{cps=50}A familiar story. Many of those who come to Outremer do so in search of missing relatives or friends.
{cps=50}But only few actually succeed.{vspace=5}Outremer is a vast place.
{cps=50}The governor promised his assistance in this search.
{cps=50}Is that so? Usually it is not in my father's habit to do things for no reason.
{cps=50}I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out he has his own reasons to help you.
{cps=50}You don't think I should trust him?
{cps=50}Are you questioning my father's honor?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Emma) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}Not at all, milady.
{cps=50}This is Outremer, [name]. It has its own rules.
{cps=50}You shouldn't expect the people of Damietta to line up before you, eagerly awaiting for their chance to aid your cause free of charge.
{cps=50}I understand, milady.
{cps=50}I was requested by my employer to find a needle in a haystack, and I would appreciate any help. Beggars, as you know, can't be choosers.
{cps=50}You father indeed appears to be a honorable, trustworthy man.
{cps=50}Thank you for your sincerity.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Emma) improved by 7!
{cps=50}Well, I won't pretend that I know anything about finding people or your dealings with my father. However, I do have one piece of advice for you.
{cps=50}I recommend starting your search at St. Lazarus Hospital at the eastern city wall. Many wounded warriors, especially those who've recently arrived in Outremer, are being treated there. You might find the person you seek there.
{cps=50}Many thanks, milady.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [st_lazarus.name!ti].
{cps=50}Hello there, [name]! I am glad to see you again.
{cps=50}I have already heard about your success at Faraskur. Great job!
{cps=50}Lately, my father has been heavily involved in disputes with the knights' orders, mobilizing nearly all of his forces against them. Damietta and its surroundings have been left almost defenseless.
{cps=50}When we received word that the Saracens had captured Faraskur, I was preparing for the worst.
{cps=50}But then you showed up and voila! The Saracens are defeated, Faraskur is back under our control, and I am happy and full of life.
{cps=50}I'm always happy to exceed your expectations, milady.
{cps=50}Consider this victory dedicated to you.
{cps=50}That is very romantic.
{cps=50}But if you seriously want to impress me, then I've got a better idea.
{cps=50}I'm all ears.
{cps=50}There is a merchant in Faraskur by the name of Farris, a caravan master who transports all sorts of valuables between Christian lands and Saracen territories.
{cps=50}War, as you probably know, hinders business but should never stop it. Trade must always go on.
{cps=50}A few months back, I ordered several expensive jewelry pieces from him. When I tried to collect my order, I ran into some... difficulties.
{cps=50}You can never trust a merchant.
{cps=50}In these lands, merchants are respectable people who honor their reputation. The soldiers usually don't harm them — neither ours nor the locals. It's a longstanding tradition.
{cps=50}Farris was not the problem. Quite the contrary, he kept his word and brought the jewelry to Faraskur. It is I who couldn't collect it.
{cps=50}At first, I sent one of my maids — a local girl — to handle the matter. But the poor thing ran into bandits and barely managed to escape. While I was thinking about my next steps, word arrived that Faraskur had fallen to the Saracens.
{cps=50}I can help you. Now that the city has been freed, the road should be a lot less dangerous.
{cps=50}Marvelous. But promise me that you won't say a word about any of this to my father. Otherwise, I might have to answer some very unpleasant questions regarding the source of the money for such things... and whether it has anything to do with the depletion of the city treasury.
{cps=50}I can keep a secret.
{cps=50}Amazing. I look forward to your success.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [traditions_of_the_trade.name!ti].
{cps=50}Hello, [name]. How was your trip?
{cps=50}It is done, milady. I collected the jewelry.
{cps=50}Fantastic! I knew that you wouldn't let me down.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Emma) improved by 10!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You can now offer gifts to Emma.
{cps=50}Well, considering all the assistance you've provided, I suppose you deserve at least a modest reward.
{cps=50}How would you like me to thank you?
{cps=50}Can I hope to see you in them? You are already stunning, and I can only imagine how stellar you would look in something this elegant...
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}I am sure you know that things like that are only worn on proper occasions. Like, perhaps, a romantic dinner.{w}{vspace=5}Does that mean you are asking me to invite you to one?
{cps=50}Well, considering all the assistance you've provided, I suppose you deserve at least a modest reward.
{cps=50}I will be waiting for you this evening.
{cps=50}This is a bold thing to ask.{w} Maybe one day. But not now.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Emma) — fail!
{cps=50}Finally! I was beginning to wonder if you'd forgotten about me.
{cps=50}How could you even suggest such a thing, milady? Ever since we parted, I could only think about our next meeting.
{cps=50}You look irresistible.
{cps=50}Thank you. I can't tell which makes me more dizzy — your compliments or the wine.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Emma) improved by 10!
{cps=50}I can compliment you all day long.
{cps=50}I do not find that hard to believe, [name]. But all in due time. First, tell me more about yourself...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You spend an amazing evening in the company of Emma de Lusignan.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Which gradually turns into an amazing night.
{cps=50}Any news? Is everything alright?
{cps=50}There were some... unexpected complications.
{cps=50}Oh Lord.
{cps=50}What is it this time?
{cps=50}Farris demands additional money: 500 more florins to cover the expenses he incurred by paying off bandits on the road.
{cps=50}...?
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}A-a-a-and? So what? Pay him then.
{cps=50}...?
{cps=50}Are you serious?
{cps=50}Christ almighty, I've heard people say that chivalry has come to an end, but I never realized just how dire things have become...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}500 florins received.{vspace=5}Relationship (Emma) lowered by 20!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item given — [ornate_cloak.name!ti].
{cps=50}A present? For me?
{cps=50}Well thank you. I won't pretend to be very impressed, but it is a welcome move nonetheless.
{cps=50}Thank you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Emma) improved by 10!

{cps=50}Oi, son! Come 'ere for a second.
{cps=50}I hear that lately you've been pretty busy setting up your little business here. Crafting all kinds of stuff and then selling it to everyone around you.
{cps=50}That's nice to hear. A good soldier ought to be cunning and resourceful, particularly when there are supply issues — which, as is often the case, are currently plenty.
{cps=50}But what a good soldier should not do is profit at the expense of his comrades, which people say is kind of what you're doing. Some of the guys are even starting to get a little bit jealous.
{cps=50}Don't worry, lad. It's not too late to win us all over, and there's just the right opportunity to do so.
{cps=50}As I've just said, the supply situation is rather dire, and my men's equipment is showing quite a bit of wear and tear. It's high time we began seeking replacements, if you know what I mean.
{cps=50}You do know what I mean, right?
{cps=50}Of course. I'm always ready to help my comrades out.
{cps=50}{i}When a friend is in trouble{vspace=5}And my name gets called{vspace=5}I will fly there as fast{vspace=5}As a crossbow bolt.
{cps=50}Yeah, sounds like something a crossbowman might say.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Crossbow skill — success!
{cps=50}Very nice.{vspace=5}Though I do hope that you're better at crafting than you are at handling crossbows...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Crossbow skill — fail!
{cps=50}Alright. It is nice to hear that we've got an understanding.
{cps=50}Here's the deal. Get me a couple of leather sheaths and two pairs of boots.
{cps=50}But of decent quality! Something that would last at least for a couple of months.{vspace=5}I know you craftsmen...
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Hey, and I almost forgot! You yoinked my bag, didn't you?
{cps=50}The one I gave you for those water canteens, remember?
{cps=50}Doesn't ring a bell!
{cps=50}Well, if you don't want me to ring your bell with the hilt of my sword... You'd better start remembering stuff, lad.
{cps=50}Oh, you mean THAT bag? Yes, yes — I might be recalling something just now...
{cps=50}Told ya.{w}{vspace=5}And don't forget to thank me for only recalling you taking one bag, not twenty-one.
{cps=50}I've got a good memory, you know. I still remember the days of the first siege of York...{w} The good old times.
{cps=50}Everything is settled then. You owe me two scabbards, two pairs of boots, and a sack.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [useful_hobby.name!ti]!
{cps=50}And we'll owe you our eternal gratitude.{w} Once that's all done, of course.

{cps=50}And we'll owe you our eternal gratitude.{w} Once that's all done, of course.
{cps=50}I'm afraid I can't really help you. I'm rather short on both time and materials...
{cps=50}Rather short, huh? I see.
{cps=50}It looks like someone's got his priorities figured out, eh?
{cps=50}I expected more from you, lad.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 30!{vspace=5}Reputation (earl) lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 25!
{cps=50}Hello, [name].
{cps=50}Or should I say — greetings, sire? Is that how we are supposed to address you now, sir knight?
{cps=50}Sounds about right.
{cps=50}But since we're old friends, I'll let it slide.
{cps=50}Ha! Well thanks for that.
{cps=50}When you were still a toddler, lad, I was already chopping Welsh rebels into pieces.
{cps=50}When you first picked up a twig to chase geese around the yard, I was already besieging Scottish castles.
{cps=50}And when you chugged your first pint, I had already drunk a lake of ale.
{cps=50}So your fancy titles won't impress me.{w} To me, you will always be just a lad — no matter how many gold chains you wear around your neck.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Don't frown! You've got a bright future ahead of you.
{cps=50}I could tell right away that you were no slouch. Even the earl and the prince trusted you with their business...{w} Yeah, you're going places. That's for sure.
{cps=50}Just remember not to turn your nose up too high. And don't forget your old friends.
{cps=50}Not all of us are destined to be knights, eh?
{cps=50}And the knights themselves wouldn't get very far without good old soldiers like myself!
{cps=50}It is indeed a pity that we had to flee from France like a bunch of scared dogs...
{cps=50}But no matter. We'll be back one day, I'm sure.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You find the sergeant rather concerned.
{cps=50}I'm not one to go about dispensing advice to just anyone... Especially when it comes to what happens in the heat of battle.
{cps=50}War is... war. Winners aren't judged. You know it yourself.
{cps=50}But still...
{cps=50}You should have let those guys go.{w} Let them recover the bodies and leave.
{cps=50}Some things are above tactical and strategic concerns. There's something higher than that.
{cps=50}Campaigns begin and end. Alliances are forged and broken.
{cps=50}Kings come and go.
{cps=50}But honor comes only once.
{cps=50}Once it is tainted, you will have to live with it for the rest of your life. There will be no recovering.
{cps=50}Especially now that you're no longer a dirty-ass peasant with an empty head and a pitchfork in your hands.
{cps=50}I knew Roger.{w} Knew many of his guys. We go back a long way.
{cps=50}He wasn't the nicest chap, that's for sure. But, as strange as it might sound, you had more in common with him and his men than with those you're commanding today.
{cps=50}That's enough grumbling, I guess... I got a little too talkative today.
{cps=50}It's probably the age...
{cps=50}Hey, [name], didn't you hear the news!? The rebels are at Windsor!
{cps=50}The earl wants you there right now, so grab your men and hit the road!
{cps=50}By the looks of it, it's something serious. I've been ordered to gather as many soldiers as possible, but that will take time. With the Lord's help we might be ready to march at dusk, but that would be the best case scenario.
{cps=50}For now, all hope rests on you.
{cps=50}Should Windsor fall, the rebels will be singing their sleazy songs about the wife of the late king straight into the windows of the young prince's residence.
{cps=50}Something tells me he's not going to be very happy about it.
{cps=50}Oi, [name]! I was just about to send someone to look for you.{w}{vspace=5}There's an interesting rumor on the streets.
{cps=50}My informants in Oxford tell me that Canterbury's waiting for several merchant ships from Venice.
{cps=50}They are believed to be carrying some serious military cargo.
{cps=50}What exactly is being shipped is unknown. But considering the length of the journey, it's safe to assume that all this hustle is not for some worn-out gambesons.
{cps=50}Getting hold of the cargo before it gets to the rebels is out of question. Word is that the ships will dock in Bristol, and we lack both the time and resources to send a proper warband there.
{cps=50}We can, however, send a small force or even a lone rider, who could get there an hour or two ahead of Canterbury's men.
{cps=50}Italian merchants are sketchy characters, which means two things. First, stealing from them isn't an option, as they're just as adept at it as we are.{w}{vspace=5}Second, they love money.{w} Very, very much.
{cps=50}If you are to approach them with a nice enough offer, then perhaps you'd be able to, y'know, 'intercept' some of the items that Canterbury's looking to get his hands on.
{cps=50}At worst, we will at least find out what the hell Canterbury's brewing. Forewarned means forearmed.
{cps=50}And even if that fails, well, you'll get some fresh air, I guess.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [merchant_of_venice.name!ti].
{cps=50}So? How are we doing under Windsor?
{cps=50}I've already heard the news. My congratulations on your new appointment.
{cps=50}Ha! I can tell by the look on your face that you're not that excited about it. But what can you do? You'll have to make it work somehow.
{cps=50}Here's the deal: there's really no shortage of peasants eager to go to war for a handful of florins or even the promise of a regular meal and a pint of ale. A steady supply of men is something I can guarantee you.
{cps=50}But when it comes to their gear, we've got a serious issue.
{cps=50}Royal arsenals have been almost stripped clean during preparations for the campaign in France, and what little remained was appropriated by Canterbury to outfit his own forces.
{cps=50}Now we have no reserves we can depend on. We'll basically have to start from scratch, either by purchasing goods from local merchants or plundering from enemies. Or by some other means — I don't know.
{cps=50}In any case, I'll get you the men, but arming them is your headache.
{cps=50}How's your trip? How are things at the outposts?
{cps=50}It's bad.{vspace=5}The ones nearest the city are entirely abandoned, and those farthest out have already fallen to Scottish forces.
{cps=50}But the mayor continues to yap about 'small raids', claiming that everything is under control.{vspace=5}{w}The old man might just be senile or delusional, but I'm afraid there might be more to it than that. Something about him is way off.
{cps=50}What about those Scottish troops?{vspace=5}How many are there? Where are they coming from? How soon will they reach the city?
{cps=50}We must gain a clear understanding of the situation. Otherwise, we won't see what's coming our way.
{cps=50}I'm already working on it. A maid from the mayor's residence told me she has relatives in a neighboring village who spotted Scottish soldiers somewhere near the city.
{cps=50}I'll find out the details.
{cps=50}A maid told you?{vspace=5}I really could have guessed. As long as girls are around, you'll always be alright, eh, [name]?
{cps=50}Well then. Find out what is happening, and I will send messengers to our main force to hasten them. After that, I will begin to prepare the city for the siege.
{cps=50}At last! You have a nasty habit of disappearing at the least appropriate moment.
{cps=50}But I always come back.
{cps=50}You do. One moment before the catastrophe.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}I see no reason to inquire about your journey when the Scots are right at our city's doorstep.{w} You were supposed to find out where they are — at least we know that now.
{cps=50}That's some high quality reconnaissance right there.
{cps=50}Honestly, every time I go on another campaign, I promise myself that this time I will be more careful — that I will hang back and let others do the fighting.
{cps=50}Yet for some bizarre reason, I always end up knee-deep in crap with my life hanging by a thread.{vspace=5}{w}And lately, you always seem to be involved. I'm starting to see a pattern here.{w} You're a dangerous man to be around, [name].
{cps=50}What can I say? Adventure is my middle name.
{cps=50}Not mine though.{vspace=5}{w}I'm getting too old for this shit.
{cps=50}I'm giving you my word — if we somehow get out of this alive — I'm hanging up the sword.{vspace=5}{w}I've had enough close calls for a lifetime.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Alright. Let's get down to business. The Scots have approached the city from the northwest, down from the hills. Their exact numbers are still unclear, but it's probably around eight to ten thousand.
{cps=50}So where the hell is our main force?
{cps=50}About a week-long march from here.
{cps=50}Since our departure, those oafs have barely covered any ground. The roads, they say, are awfully bad.{vspace=5}I knew that one of us had to stay behind to keep an eye on them.
{cps=50}We basically have to last a week under siege? Sounds doable.
{cps=50}Only if the city is actually prepared for the siege.{vspace=5}And York is not 'entirely ready', to put it mildly.
{cps=50}I see. How bad is it?
{cps=50}Somewhere between 'very bad' and 'you-cannot-even-imagine-how-bad'.
{cps=50}Whatever provisions that remained have already been exhausted by the refugees.
{cps=50}On top of that, the garrison is rather tiny. Mustering an effective fighting force is not possible. If the Scots attempt a direct assault then... well...
{cps=50}...my chances of living long enough to retire are pretty damn slim.
{cps=50}It looks like we're in a rather difficult situation.
{cps=50}We're deep in shit, [name].
{cps=50}I wonder what Northampton would do in this situation.
{cps=50}Old man Jerome would find a way out of any situation. Damn, he'd outwit the Devil himself if he had to. Mark my word, when the day comes and we're all burning in Hell, Jerome will be the one tending to the cauldrons for the fiends.
{cps=50}There is indeed a way out of any situation. We just have to think outside the box...
{cps=50}Think outside the box, you say...
{cps=50}Alright. Listen here. There are two things we have to do: find out what the Scots are planning and win some time. Both of them can be accomplished in one step.
{cps=50}Negotiations?
{cps=50}Exactly.
{cps=50}You're a respectable person now — [player_title!ti] and everything — so go for it. Go to the Scottish camp with a white flag.
{cps=50}Talk to them, find out what they are after, discuss the terms of surrender, and all that crap. And while you're talking, take a couple of good looks around.
{cps=50}Act as if you've already decided to surrender, but keep stalling for time. Where there's one meeting, there's always another. You can even go on a hunt together. Et cetera.{vspace=5}Hopefully it'll help us waste a week of their time.
{cps=50}While you're busy smooth-talking them into oblivion, I'll work on the garrison and start building up some kind of militia force. Don't expect any miracles though.
{cps=50}We've got no one to count on, [name]. We're on our own now, you and I.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [birds_of_a_feather.name!ti].
{cps=50}How did the negotiations go? Did they give you anything to work with?
{cps=50}Well, there's something.
{cps=50}They are here because of the mayor. They blame him for the disappearance of their people. Considering what I saw in Eldham, their accusations aren't exactly unfounded.
{cps=50}If we hand the mayor over to them, we might avoid the assault.
{cps=50}I tried to win some time, but it was not possible.
{cps=50}It's either I give them the mayor or they attack tomorrow morning.
{cps=50}The right choice seems rather obvious, if you ask me...
{cps=50}Have you gone mad, [name]?
{cps=50}Are you seriously considering handing a subject of the English king over to foreigners? Without a trial? Without an investigation?
{cps=50}If that donkey of a mayor is indeed guilty, then he has to be tried. Tried in accordance with our laws and traditions. And if he must face execution, it will be at the command of King Edward and no one else.
{cps=50}You didn't hear me right, did you? I just said that they will proceed with the assault if we do not hand the mayor over. An assault that, in your own words, we cannot repel.
{cps=50}If we cannot repel it, then so be it. We will die trying.
{cps=50}King Edward sent you north to protect his lands and his subjects — not to grovel before foreign invaders. Avoiding bloodshed is a respectable thing to do, but never at the cost of humiliation.
{cps=50}What if everything they accuse the mayor of is actually true? We could save the city and punish the criminal in one fell swoop!
{cps=50}And what if he's innocent? No matter how much of a moron he is, he's still a subject of the English king and only the king has the right to decide his fate, goddammit!
{cps=50}We've been in some shit, you and I, and you have always been loyal to the oath you gave to the crown. No matter what.
{cps=50}I don't expect that to change now.
{cps=50}I'll wait for you on the walls.
{cps=50}I'm gathering a warband. I need men.
{cps=50}I've got a couple of promising candidates, but don't expect much.
{cps=50}I need men for my warband.
{cps=50}Losses? Understandable.
{cps=50}I've found a couple of good guys, but don't expect any war heroes.
{cps=50}I need men for my warband.
{cps=50}I'm afraid I don't have anyone to offer at the moment.
{cps=50}I need men for my warband.
{cps=50}There are a couple of decent guys among those soldiers you rescued from the Scots. They'd be happy to join you.
{cps=50}I want to help a person escape the city. Get them as far away from here as possible.
{cps=50}Do we have any options?
{cps=50}A person?
{cps=50}Who is that mysterious individual?{vspace=5}{w}You do understand that if the Scots assault the city, we'll need every last man on the walls, right?
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Oh I see.{vspace=5}{w}It's a girl, isn't it?
{cps=50}That maid who leaked information to you from the mayor's residence?
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}Maybe.{w} Maybe not.{w} Maybe that's none of your business.
{cps=50}Uh-huh. You can stop pretending. I can see right through you.
{cps=50}Can we send her out with a couple of our men? Reliable people.
{cps=50}Sure we can!{vspace=5}{w}But who the hell is going to protect the walls against the Scots then? The saints above? Or perhaps the children of you two?
{cps=50}Something tells me neither the former nor the latter will be coming to our aid.
{cps=50}I don't need you to lecture me. Just tell me what can we do.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}Well, luckily for you, I did some looking around too. There's a gang of smugglers who used to supply the city with alcohol. Now, they are offering their services as guides, helping folks flee the city. For a price, of course.
{cps=50}Typically, they take people to Selby, south of here. From Selby, one can easily reach Howden, where our main force should be right now.{vspace=5}This is looking to be your safest bet.
{cps=50}Where do I find these smugglers?
{cps=50}I'll set everything up. Just get the money ready.
{cps=50}As you can probably tell, they don't really suffer from a shortage of clients these days, so saving the girl won't be exactly cheap. They'd ask for one grand at the very least, I'd say.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated — [escape.name!ti].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}1,000 florins lost.
{cps=50}After making a deal with them, you agree on a meeting place and proceed to retrieve Lina, whom you find ready for departure.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New militiamen armed: [attackchance]{vspace=5}Militiamen total: [windsor_militiamen_gathered]{vspace=10}Fresh reinforcements are heading to Windsor!
{cps=50}Great.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) improved by 5!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Well done, lad. I knew I could count on you.
{cps=50}If the earl mentions your name, I'll let him know that you helped us.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) improved by 5!
{cps=50}I honestly don't expect him to mention it, but that's another story...
{cps=50}Good job. I have no clue what the hell you were doing in that forest, but you found this bastard — and that's very good.
{cps=50}There are always deserters in any campaign... Usually, those scoundrels tend to run off empty-handed, but this cheeky bastard yoinked a full set of armor!
{cps=50}I'm sure he'll be very happy to see us again.{w} Especially the torture master.
{cps=50}I've seen that guy work; he's pretty bloody good. People tend to get extremely obedient after a couple hours. What's left of them, that is.
{cps=50}This is for you. A little 'thank you' from the earl.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+25 florins!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Talk about the war? Ha! As if there is something to tell, really...
{cps=50}The king set off on a grand campaign on the mainland. France is now at its weakest point ever, which presents a golden opportunity to claim a sizable piece of land from these frog eaters.
{cps=50}You and I, however, have nothing to rejoice about. Yes, the pay is good this time, but I strongly doubt that this war will be easy.
{cps=50}In and out. Twenty-minute adventure!
{cps=50}Good money, warm bed, and rich spoils!
{cps=50}The last time I fell for this recruiters' sale pitch, I ended up in the mountains of Scotland with holes in my boots, a void in my stomach, and an arrow in my knee...
{cps=50}I still don't understand how I managed not to die then. The earl and I miraculously got back alive...
{cps=50}But we kicked the highlanders' arses so badly, they still can't sit! A-ha-ha-ha!
{cps=50}Well, we clearly lucked out with the camp. Compared to what we had in Scotland, here we'll be living like kings!
{cps=50}The camp and the surrounding areas are full of opportunities. Just keep your eyes peeled.
{cps=50}I know that young recruits tend to get excited about the salary, but — trust the old man — don't get hung up on it.
{cps=50}You're probably thinking of returning home as a rich man and wowing the girls with luxurious gifts, but I'll tell you what, boy...
{cps=50}Do not fill your pockets with useless gold. Better to put money into business — get yourself some decent equipment.
{cps=50}Iron looks much less pretty than gold, yes, but it may well save your life in battle. Pockets full of florins would be of little use.
{cps=50}Back home, it is the hefty purse that makes a man rich. But here, the rich is the one who is alive and in one piece. You'll understand that soon enough.
{cps=50}Hah, well, if you've managed to find yourself at war with your pants down, then you don't have many options.
{cps=50}Take a look around the camp. Someone might have a spare gambeson, a chainmail, or a shield lying around.
{cps=50}Most soldiers would be happy to sell their ware or trade loot for a shiny coin. But to find something useful among the junk is mostly a matter of luck, you know.
{cps=50}Well, the second option, of course, is to loot it yourself. Scavenging corpses like a vulture isn't the most honorable act, but sometimes survival demands it.
{cps=50}I try to make sure that my people are decently equipped, but I don't have time to wipe each and every one of your snotty noses, even if I wanted to.
{cps=50}If you prove yourself a decent lad, then I'll see what I can do for you.
{cps=50}You've proven yourself. I need men like you — preferably in one piece.
{cps=50}If you ever need to get a hold of a specific piece of equipment, come see me. I'll see what can be done.
{cps=50}Hopefully I don't need to explain that it won't be for free. But don't worry — I won't try to make a living off of you.
{cps=50}We'll work something out.
{cps=50}Listen, lad, don't bother me with your problems. I already have enough of my own. You're the one responsible for this task, so sort it out yourself.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation check failed!
{cps=50}Yeah, this is quite the task.{w}But we're no strangers, so I'll give you a hand.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (sergeant) — success!
{cps=50}So I'll give you a hand.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) — success!
{cps=50}In Count Sunderland's warparty, there's this fellow by the name of Vettori, an Italian mercenary. Go find him. He looks like a typical southerner — you can't miss him.
{cps=50}What did you find? A contract? Let me take a look...
{cps=50}Hm-m-m...
{cps=50}Yes, I know the man. Jonathan Calverly from Oxford. He and a bunch of his guys went missing about a week or so back. We tried to search for him but to no avail.
{cps=50}What did you say happened to him?
{cps=50}He and his men are dead. They got ambushed in the woods.
{cps=50}Cut into shreds, all valuables stolen.
{cps=50}I see. Well, may the Lord rest their souls.
{cps=50}I'll pass on the news to the earl, and we'll send someone to bury the bodies.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) improved by 3!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [supplier.name!ti].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Working at the forge is a camp activity that acts as a temporary part-time job. Unlike other activities, this one increases your Fatigue instead of lowering it.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}However, forge duty increases your Craftsmanship and earns you some money, with the amount depending on your Craftsmanship.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Working at the forge has been added to your camp activities.
{cps=50}I'll consider it. So what about repairing my equipment?
{cps=50}I'm not a scrawny ragamuffin...
{cps=50}...?
{cps=50}How much did Hoggard promise you for the chest?
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}The chest will act as your secondary inventory, which can be accessed from the main inventory when you're in camp. You can freely transfer any items between the two.
{cps=50}I'm sure someone's going to buy it.
{cps=50}If you've got any work for me, I'd be ready to help out. I need some money.
{cps=50}I'm not a clumsy dork.
{cps=50}What on earth are you even on about? Didn't I just recently help you at the forge!? I don't recall you having a single complaint.
{cps=50}I'm ready.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}In the 'Crafting' menu, you can combine different types of armor and helmets in order to create new items with improved characteristics.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The result will be influenced by your Craftsmanship skill. Approximately every 5 points of Craftsmanship provide a new bonus.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Items produced through crafting cannot be combined for a second time.
{cps=50}The armor's ready. I followed your every instruction.
{cps=50}Any new orders?
{cps=50}I was under the impression that scars decorate a man's face. He seems to be overreacting.
{cps=50}Different strokes...
{cps=50}The helmet's ready.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Repair the item for [price] florins?{vspace=5}(You have [player_gold] florins)
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Repaired!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}Seeing your displeasure, he reassures you, saying that he has helped people with similar searches in the past and that it always takes some time.  He advises you to get comfortable in Damietta, as you may be staying for a while.
{cps=50}He even offers you to temporarily enter his service, which would entitle you to a full salary and good working conditions.
{cps=50}You agree.
{cps=50}You receive a salary and rations.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}150 florins received!
{cps=50}Now that you've officially entered his service, the governor assigns you to deal with yet another source of unrest in the city.
{cps=50}Apparently, some itinerant Italian bard from Florence arrived in Damietta some time ago and began singing sleazy songs mocking the governor and his policies.
{cps=50}The governor's men tried to challenge him to duels on multiple occasions, but the damned rogue proved to be an excellent duelist and defeated his opponent every time.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [politics_101.name!ti].
{cps=50}The governor shrugs, stating that, in this case, you have no option but to wait.
{cps=50}The next time you visit the governor for news of Renauld, he is happy to tell you that things have finally moved forward.
{cps=50}However, your joy quickly gives way to apprehension as you learn the full story.
{cps=50}The records of the order indeed confirm that Renauld de Châtillon was among the people of the Comte de Mollet stationed in the Fortress of Ezbert.
{cps=50}The records also note that Renauld became ill and initially received treatment at one of Damietta's infirmaries — before being transferred to the fortress for further care.
{cps=50}There is no mention of his death, hinting at his recovery and subsequent return to duty.
{cps=50}Information on Count de Mollet's unit is likewise sparse; among the few details recorded about the detachment's combat history, only one stands out as noteworthy.
{cps=50}Apparently, some of de Mollet's men were ambushed near Faraskur. Many survivors of the group were taken as prisoners.
{cps=50}In light of the information revealed in the archival records, the governor suggests that Renauld may very well have been captured.
{cps=50}According to him, it is not uncommon for warriors from both sides to be held as prisoners, including high-ranking officials.
{cps=50}In fact, the governorate of Damietta and the Saracens frequently ransom their captives — particularly those of noble lineage.
{cps=50}The problem is that paying a ransom is often a convoluted and lengthy process, requiring extensive bargaining from both sides. There's only one way to expedite it.
{cps=50}Offer a high-value prisoner in exchange.
{cps=50}Sensing the governor's intent, you ask about the specific individual you need to kidnap as a bargaining chip.
{cps=50}Pleased by your insight, the governor names a certain Beibars, a mid-career Mamluk warlord who controls the trade routes around Damietta.
{cps=50}Once captured, Beibars' extensive connections would also come in handy during the search for Renauld.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [abduction.name!ti].
{cps=50}You inquire with the governor about any updates concerning Renauld, but he informs that his search has not been fruitful.
{cps=50}The governor hints that the search for Renauld may ultimately be in vain.
{cps=50}As the sergeant promised, locating Vettori among Count Sunderland's men proves effortless; his distinctive Mediterranean appearance makes him easily recognizable.
{cps=50}Vettori claims he'll take care of most of the preparations. As for you, you'll need to get two things: a crossbow trigger, as well as a sturdy bowstring from a particularly powerful crossbow.
{cps=50}Vettori goes on to mention that obtaining the components is your responsibility and that he can't be bothered to assist you in that regard.
{cps=50}However, he does add that you could, as a last resort, try to fashion something from makeshift materials or remove the required components from other crossbows of suitable design.
{cps=50}He does agree to help you, but under the condition that you do a favor for him — first.{vspace=5}Namely, get him a new pair of boots to replace the one he has recently worn out.
{cps=50}Vettori is not going to help you until you get him a new pair of boots.
{cps=50}Vettori informs you that the crossbow is ready.
{cps=50}Vettori is waiting for you to obtain the components required for the crossbow.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item lost — [cozy_boots.name!ti].
{cps=50}Since you have fulfilled your end of the bargain, Vettori agrees to help you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item lost — [leather_boots.name!ti].

{cps=50}After the necessary components have been gathered, Vettori spends several hours modifying the crossbow. Once he's satisfied with the calibration of the weapon, he signals that it's time to head to the Falcon Tower.

{cps=50}You seriously want to try getting paid under this contract? Is that what you're saying?
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Alright, let's pretend for a moment that I do actually agree with you. But how the hell are we supposed to even get that money? Just go and ask for it?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 5!
{cps=50}I seriously doubt anyone in their right mind would mistake me for a knight... And you with that thuggish face of yours might at best come off as a knight's war horse...
{cps=50}What do you mean, dress up?{w}{vspace=5}And how the hell much is 'a bit'?
{cps=50}No way. I'm not taking part in anything like that. What if he's got family? Surely his wife and kids could use the money? I'm giving the contract to the sergeant — he'll know what to do with it.
{cps=50}Not everything in life is about money. There are things that are way more important.
{cps=50}Amazingly, this joke of a plan somehow works. The treasurer, occupied with some important business, barely glances at you and, after carefully checking the contract, hands you a hefty sack of gold — which you split with Bartholomew.{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}+70 florins!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}The ship sinks before it has sailed. The treasurer needs but one glance to realize that you're not who you're pretending to be.{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — fail (required: 30)!
{cps=50}You stutter as you explain that you accidentally found the contract and are definitely not after the money, before quickly hightailing it out of there.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Prestige lowered by 1!
{cps=50}I'm ready.{vspace=5}To save your relationship with a girl whom I've never met and whose father has been incidentally spying on us on behalf of the enemy.
{cps=50}I seriously hope she's worth it.
{cps=50}Alright. Let's see what you've got there. Probably all stolen, eh?
{cps=50}Some {i}what{/i}?
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}I saw some rusty old chain near the barn the other day.{w}{vspace=5}It might still be there if you hurry up.
{cps=50}I'll see what I can do, I guess.
{cps=50}That poor girl you robbed?
{cps=50}..?
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}And...? Please don't tell me you want to do something about it.
{cps=50}'{b}We{/b}' have experience?
{cps=50}It's not quite the same thing.
{cps=50}Something's telling me that if you go there alone you'll end up behind bars again.{w} It seems like I don't have much of a choice.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Did you find out where he's being held?
{cps=50}The city hall? Are you sure we can pull off something like that?
{cps=50}I wouldn't mind sneaking into some hovel on the edge of the city... But the city hall?
{cps=50}Alright. But we do as I say.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}You can?{w}{vspace=5}Well then, I won't stand in your way.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}I'm not going to risk my life saving your relationship with some random girl whose father has been spying on us for the French.
{cps=50}Truly a mystery worth unraveling.
{cps=50}Half of the soldiers in our army could aptly be described as 'suspicious ragamuffins'; they probably just saw allies from other units.
{cps=50}I'm a certified crow spotter.
{cps=50}For someone who barely survived the previous assault, you're a little too optimistic.
{cps=50}I'd simply hope not to die, if I were you.
{cps=50}Perhaps he can. He's already taught me how to make things disappear.{w}{vspace=5}Things like our chances of ever capturing this goddamn city...
{cps=50}I wish I had your problems.
{cps=50}What a story.
{cps=50}You shouldn't trust everything you hear, pal.
{cps=50}Oh, I'm sure you would...
{cps=50}Get yourself ready, [name]. We've got some tough times ahead of us.
{cps=50}As you head towards Dartford, intent on informing your superiors about the unfortunate conclusion of your relationship with Alyssa, memories of an unfinished quest to uncover a sword in Lindisfarne come flooding back.
{cps=50}Realizing that bad news might be softened by good news, you decide to take a detour to the abbey.
{cps=50}Ah, [name]. Finally! Any progress with the countess?
{cps=50}I'm afraid I don't have the best of news, sire.
{cps=50}The countess and I had a certain... misunderstanding.{w} I'm not sure if she wants to see me ever again.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}And perhaps the reverse is also true...
{cps=50}Erhm...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) lowered by 20!
{cps=50}Judging by that sour look on your face, the decision to break up was not mutual.
{cps=50}She didn't break your heart, did she?
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}This is not the way I wanted the relationship to end.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The prince starts softly humming a tune, his head hunched over the map.
{cps=50}{i}The saddest part{vspace=5}Of a broken heart{vspace=5}Isn't the ending{vspace=5}So much as the start.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The earl joins in.
{cps=50}{i}The tragedy starts{vspace=5}From the very first spark{vspace=5}Losing your mind{vspace=5}For the sake of your heart.
{cps=50}I'm all right. Seriously.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Raising his eyes from the map, Prince Edward frowns.
{cps=50}Well, it's nice to hear that. Last thing we need is for you to spiral into depression.
{cps=50}Hey, [name], can you briefly remind me why the hell did we even take you with us in the first place?
{cps=50}The sword is lost, and the girl hates you.
{cps=50}Zero out of two, [name].{w} You aren't playing that hot on the home field. You were doing way better when away.
{cps=50}I could, of course, send you to fetch me some wine, but the Dartford cellars are stocked to the brim, as you know.
{cps=50}Alright. To hell with this whining.
{cps=50}At this point, it doesn't matter what went our way and what didn't. We've got nowhere to run now, so there's no other option but to push forward.
{cps=50}Until we get what we want, or die trying.
{cps=50}Monday dawn, we march on London with whatever we can muster. Come dusk I will either be the king or a dead man.
{cps=50}You have failed me, [name]. But as a virtuous monarch, I will give you another chance.
{cps=50}If you indeed are a man of honor — the man I believe you to be — you will do what you must and not fail me again.
{cps=50}Even if you'll have to lose your life in the process.
{cps=50}I won't fail you, sire.
{cps=50}That we shall see.
{cps=50}Go get yourself ready, [name]. We've got some tough days ahead of us.
{cps=50}Why the hell are you still in London!?
{cps=50}Didn't the messenger tell you that the rebels are advancing on Windsor?
{cps=50}We barely have any forces over there, so grab your men and get there as fast as possible.
{cps=50}The last thing we need is for Canterbury to turn Windsor into his stronghold — right at our doorstep.
{cps=50}You can't let them capture the town, got it?
{cps=50}You can count on me, sire.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You find Northampton caught up in his thoughts. On the table in front of him, alongside his customary fine wine, lies a spread of fortune-telling cards.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After another long sip, he notices your arrival.
{cps=50}Ready to talk about your assignment, [name]? Well, here's the deal.
{cps=50}I will be honest with you: we don't have much chance of beating Canterbury in a pitched battle.
{cps=50}We lack strength. And one who lacks strength has to search for allies. This is the only way to tip the scale in our favor. Or, at the very least, balance it.
{cps=50}Where do I have to go?
{cps=50}The first gentleman you have to pay a visit to is John Mortimer, the Marquis of Radcliffe. He was exiled... Or, should I say, relocated, to Chippenham Castle a few years ago.
{cps=50}Radcliffe has men. Few, but very experienced. Many of them are veterans of past campaigns in Wales and Scotland. Well-armed. Plus, the marquis himself is a seasoned warrior...
{cps=50}He was supposed to sail with us to France. But at the last moment, the king had a change of heart and chose not to call him to arms. Couldn't get over the old grievances.
{cps=50}He'd make a valuable ally. If he can let go of his grudge, that is.
{cps=50}May I know what exactly happened between him and the king? After all, I have to...
{cps=50}[name]... {w}Don't.{w}{vspace=5}Just don't.
{cps=50}Now, onto the next one.{vspace=5}The second gentleman you must deliver the letter to is Edmund Hastings, the Baron of Colchester. Master of Castle Hadley.
{cps=50}Unsurprisingly, his relationship with the royal family is rather complicated too...
{cps=50}Who would've thought...
{cps=50}Stop being such a smartass.
{cps=50}Or our relationship might become complicated too.
{cps=50}My bad, sire.
{cps=50}Alright, so I was saying... Colchester was supposed to go with us to France, but as the king began preparing for the expedition, a plague broke out in the baron's domain.
{cps=50}He asked the king for aid...{w} And received it he did. However, due to the military preparations, the aid was not as substantial as the baron had hoped for.
{cps=50}Which led to a... misunderstanding between him and the crown.
{cps=50}It's been over a year though, so I wouldn't be surprised if this conflict has been resolved.
{cps=50}And who's our third potential ally?
{cps=50}Henry Stafford, the Duke of Cambridge. The most powerful of the trio. Whether he sides with us or with Canterbury could be the primary factor influencing the outcome of this war.
{cps=50}Honestly, I expected him to have flocked under Canterbury's banner by now. But for some reason this did not happen. Which means we can still turn him into an ally.
{cps=50}Let me guess. He also has a grudge against the old king.
{cps=50}He might. To a lesser extent.{w} It's me he's got a bone to pick with.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You can already guess what the answer will be, but curiosity makes you ask anyway.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Can I ask why?
{cps=50}Why do you think, [name]? Because of the land, of course. It's always because of the land.
{cps=50}That scoundrel had been eyeing the lands to the east of my family's manor — Bedford, Huntington, Stamford...
{cps=50}Not the worst places, as you might know. Before they became mine, they were quite the source of contention. It got so bad that the king himself had to intervene.
{cps=50}Henry expected the king to support his claims. Thought that his services and loyalty to the crown would finally pay off.
{cps=50}But the king thought differently.
{cps=50}There is indeed one blemish on Henry's service to the crown: he smuggled French alcohol into the kingdom through Scotland without paying any taxes. The crown did not receive a dime, while the duke got fat on profits.
{cps=50}During the Scottish campaign, I personally put an end to that little 'business venture' of his. This endeared me much to the king.
{cps=50}Long story short, this is all rather complicated...
{cps=50}I'll just say that, since then, the Duke of Cambridge has not been on the best of terms with either the royal family or me.
{cps=50}This is just great.
{cps=50}Cheer up, [name]. These are honorable people. No matter how complicated their relations with the crown may be, they won't be greeting you with volleys of crossbow bolts.
{cps=50}I wouldn't be surprised if many of those old grudges have already been long forgotten. You've got nothing to worry about.{w}{vspace=5}Probably.
{cps=50}Somehow I find that hard to believe, sire. The more likely option is...
{cps=50}That you will shut up and listen to me. This is the most likely option.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}So what was I saying... Yes, here's one more thing.{vspace=5}How does that poem go...
{cps=50}Down to Gehenna or up to the Throne,{vspace=5}He travels the fastest who travels alone.
{cps=50}The capital and its surroundings are crawling with Canterbury's spies. It's better to go alone so you can slip past them unnoticed.
{cps=50}And remember: success or failure of this mission might just decide the fate of the whole war.
{cps=50}I thought the outcome of a war is decided on the battlefield.
{cps=50}Major battles are always a coin toss. The will of Providence.{vspace=5}Canterbury understands this very well and therefore is in no hurry.
{cps=50}Our attack near London was, to an extent, a desperation move that caught him off-guard. We played our cards well and got very lucky, but ultimately the balance of power hardly shifted.
{cps=50}Canterbury still possesses vastly superior resources, and thus our best bet is to recruit powerful allies, nullifying any further advantages he may hold over us.
{cps=50}Then, once we're on equal footing, we'll force him to negotiate.
{cps=50}Really? Is he supposed to just throw away all his plans and make peace with us?
{cps=50}Don't worry about that part, [name].{w}{vspace=5}I've already got a plan.
{cps=50}Last question, sire.{w}{vspace=5}What should I do with the sword?
{cps=50}The one from the abbey? You can leave it here, if you want. Or hold on to it for the time being.
{cps=50}In case you forgot, we needed it to execute Canterbury if the opportunity arose... But it didn't. At least for now.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [hellish_trio_chippenham.name!ti].{vspace=5}New quest added — [hellish_trio_hadley.name!ti].{vspace=5}New quest added — [hellish_trio_cambridge.name!ti].
{cps=50}I don't have time for you, [name].
{cps=50}Recently, your 'genius' decisions have been costing us quite a bit.
{cps=50}The loss of Windsor puts us on the brink of a catastrophe. I'm working very hard to prevent it.
{cps=50}We might still come out on top, but we cannot afford any more failures.{vspace=5}{w}So...
{cps=50}...for the sake of Virgin Mary...
{cps=50}...and all the saints above...
{cps=50}...try not to screw up your diplomatic assignment.
{cps=50}As you know first-hand, I value and reward usefulness and loyalty. But if, instead of helping me solve my problems, you create new ones... my hand won't hesitate.
{cps=50}Your downfall would be even more meteoric than your rise.
{cps=50}Don't fail me.
{cps=50}How are we doing under Windsor, [name]?
{cps=50}Everything's under control, sire. The rebels are stubborn, but the town will soon be ours.
{cps=50}That's very nice to hear.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) improved by 5!
{cps=50}We are not doing very well, sire. I'm desperate for any help I can get.
{cps=50}Hell, I knew that would happen...
{cps=50}Regrettably, we're currently short on manpower. Our financial resources are somewhat limited too...
{cps=50}Isn't there something that can be done?
{cps=50}Well, here's an idea. Tomorrow, there's going be a meeting among the members of London's trade guild. All kinds of wealthy merchants will be present — traders, bankers, ship owners, you name it.
{cps=50}Pay them a visit. Tell them about the situation in Windsor and the consequences for London if we fail to reclaim the town.{vspace=5}{w}Get them scared enough, and they might give you a coin or two.
{cps=50}I'd go there myself, but just last week Prince Edward and I 'squeezed' 50,000 florins out of them for 'military needs'. I doubt they'd be happy to see me.
{cps=50}This time you're on your own. But I'm sure it'll be fine.{w} Just remember to dress accordingly.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [silvertongue.name!ti].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [suicide_squad.name!ti].
{cps=50}This will not only deny Ruffin any reinforcements but also ensure the safety of the flanks during the impending assault.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [winnig_the_war.name!ti]!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [suicide_squad.name].{vspace=5}New quest added - [counter_strike.name].
{cps=50}And thus the rag-tag army of Rennes arose from its ashes like a phoenix, raised its banners, and set out on the march.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [counter_strike.name!ti]!
{cps=50}According to him, it can be done for 400 florins.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [lobbyist.name!ti].
{cps=50}According to him, it can be done for 200 florins.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [lobbyist.name!ti].
{cps=50}But it's not all that bad. De Guesclin agrees to take on the issues of recruiting, funding, and training new soldiers. But he will need some serious help with arming and equipping them.
{cps=50}{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [all_the_queensmen.name!ti].
{cps=50}Among the various benefits that this rank provides, you gain access to a chest for storing equipment and loot.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Chest obtained!
{cps=50}Following one of the countryside roads, you come upon a small tavern by the lake. Its welcoming owners offer you to stay there for a couple of hours to rest, relax, and have a full meal — for the cost of just 10 florins.
{cps=50}You agree and spend the next few hours enjoying the owners' hospitality.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}10 florins lost.{vspace=5}Time wasted: 1.
{cps=50}The meal that they cook for you turns out to be exceptionally delicious, revitalizing you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality increased by 2!
{cps=50}You don't feel like wasting your time and politely refuse.
{cps=50}The idea doesn't seem all that bad, but your pockets are empty — making your decision easier. Politely refusing, you continue on your way.
{cps=50}Wandering around the countryside, you notice a pillar of smoke rising beyond a nearby hill.
{cps=50}You proceed towards the source and find a windmill engulfed in flames. Its owner, coughing from the smoke, is struggling to drag bales of flour outside.
{cps=50}Upon seeing you, he immediately starts tearfully begging you to help him save his goods.
{cps=50}You agree, and after taking a deep breath, rush into the burning windmill.
{cps=50}Despite the thick smoke and flames hindering your senses and movement, you somehow succeed in locating and removing several heavy bales out of the fire.
{cps=50}Breathing smoke soon causes you to start feeling unwell. Fortunately, your constitution wards off most of the adverse effects.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance — success!
{cps=50}While this impromptu rescue effort falls short of salvaging all the windmill owner's belongings, he still thanks you for trying and pledges to keep you in his prayers.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}You say your goodbyes and get back on your way.

{cps=50}You say your goodbyes and get back on your way.
{cps=50}A glance at the blazing windmill is sufficient to recognize that the structure could collapse within moments. You refuse to risk your life.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Cursing you, the owner rushes back in himself, disappearing in the smoke.
{cps=50}A moment later, just like you expected, the windmill collapses.
{cps=50}You say a prayer for his soul and get back on your way.
{cps=50}Wandering around the countryside, you meet a group of travelers. They appear deeply worried, huddling around one of their companions who is lying on the ground.
{cps=50}As soon as you show up, they ask you for help.
{cps=50}Apparently, their friend ate some kind of weird mushroom, which immediately made him feel unwell. His condition has gotten worse with every passing minute, and now the poor man is dying right before their eyes.
{cps=50}It's clear that, without some kind of medical aid, he will lose his life in a matter of hours.
{cps=50}You agree to help the man, treating him with the medicine that you carry. The effect is instantaneous; his condition is already improving.
{cps=50}Now fully conscious, the man thanks you for saving his life. As a token of gratitude, he gifts you a precious ring from his own finger.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!

{cps=50}You say your goodbyes and part ways with the travelers.
{cps=50}You tell them that you're unable to offer assistance and continue on your way.
{cps=50}Wandering around the countryside, you encounter a knight-pilgrim returning from the Holy Land.
{cps=50}He seems delighted to see you and initiates a conversation. He inquires about the state of affairs around here, listening to your responses with great interest.
{cps=50}He thanks you for satisfying his curiosity and recognizes you as a devout person. He offers you a small gift in the form of a crude metal ring, adorned with engraved crosses.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue — success!
{cps=50}The knight claims that this humble trinket came to symbolize the unwavering strength of his faith throughout his pilgrimage. He made a personal vow that should he safely return home, he would entrust it to the first worthy person he met.
{cps=50}Having satisfied his curiosity, he thanks you and goes on his way.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue — fail!
{cps=50}On this good note, the knight wishes you farewell and goes on his way.
{cps=50}Wandering around the countryside, you encounter a wandering merchant selling all kinds of potions and elixirs.
{cps=50}The merchant is clearly desperate to sell his wares, going as far as boasting about their potent effects.
{cps=50}As he sifts through his flasks, he prattles on incessantly, making grandiose promises of everlasting life, extraordinary health, luck of the devil, and invincibility in battle.
{cps=50}Among the things he has for sale are...
{cps=50}Dragon's Blood, which doubles the health of anyone who takes a sip.
{cps=50}Tears of the Phoenix, which heal all injuries, wounds, and diseases known to man.
{cps=50}Witch's Brew, which brings the dead back to life.
{cps=50}Essence of Luck, which guarantees eternal fortune in all endeavors to those who consume it.
{cps=50}...and finally...{w} A Potion of Eternal Life, which grants immortality.
{cps=50}The merchant himself does not look trustworthy one bit, but his promises are indeed alluring...
{cps=50}With enthusiasm, the merchant accepts the coins, hands over the desired item, and with a sly chuckle, swiftly disappears.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}40 florins lost.
{cps=50}Upon examining your purchase, you realize that the magical 'Dragon's Blood' is nothing but... a flask of stale ale. You consider getting back to the merchant to offer him a taste of his own 'Dragon's Blood', but that wily fox is nowhere to be found.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}With enthusiasm, the merchant accepts the coins, hands over the desired item, and with a sly chuckle, swiftly disappears.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}40 florins lost.

{cps=50}Buying stuff from sleazy characters does not seem to be a wise decision, so you decline his offers and continue on your way.
{cps=50}You continue on your way.
{cps=50}You stumble upon a delightful grove and decide to venture inside. The rustling of leaves brings a soothing calmness, and the wind carries away your thoughts, whisking them somewhere far, far away.
{cps=50}You remember Eva and what you've done to her. Did you love her? Did you have a choice?
{cps=50}Could things have turned out differently if not for this war? And if it weren't for someone's obsession with foolish orders, the execution of which ultimately proved to be pointless anyway...
{cps=50}The past is a quiet lake. But linger in it too long, and it will transform into a turbulent whirlpool, threatening to pull you into its depths... until you drown.
{cps=50}Repressing these thoughts, you continue on your way.
{cps=50}The winding roads of the countryside eventually lead you into the woods, where you soon stumble upon several lifeless bodies strewn across a clearing, each bearing multiple wounds.
{cps=50}Judging by their clothes and what remains of their equipment, they were most likely a knight and his retinue. They seem to have been ambushed.
{cps=50}The bodies have been stripped clean of valuables, leaving behind only items that are either damaged or stained with blood.
{cps=50}The knight's travel bag, pierced by a crossbow bolt, is turned inside out. Beside it lies a piece of parchment, revealed to be a contract. It confirms the knight and his men's enlistment into royal service and a handsome payout for their participation in the campaign.
{cps=50}You pocket the parchment and get back on your way.
{cps=50}As befits a true lord, you organize an extravagant hunt, by the end of which you obtain bountiful game.
{cps=50}Venturing away from the relative safety of Damietta's walls, you explore the surrounding territories.
{cps=50}A gang of bandits ambushes you as soon as you stick your nose out of the city gates...
{cps=50}Using your hunting equipment, you score some game to sell for money.
{cps=50}All this greatly benefits your health, though you do end up spending quite some time.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality increased by 1!{vspace=5}Time lost: 3.
{cps=50}On your way back, you encounter a group of bandits lurking by the roadside, intent on ambushing unsuspecting travelers.
{cps=50}They mistake you for one of their own and let you pass.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue — success!
{cps=50}You, however, harbor no peaceful intentions and choose to attack them.
{cps=50}On your way back, you pass by a tiny village, which is in the process of being pillaged by a gang of marauders.
{cps=50}The horrified villagers are begging for your help.
{cps=50}You're not one to turn a blind eye to those in need, so you agree to help them deal with the scoundrels.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}Unwilling to get dragged into such a predicament, you refuse their plea for help.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 30!

{cps=50}Wandering around the countryside, you run into a wealthy nobleman out on a hunt with his retinue.
{cps=50}The nobleman acknowledges your status and offers you to join him on the hunt.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!
{cps=50}After the hunt ends, the nobleman, impressed by your skills, presents you with a parting gift.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Crossbow skill — success!{vspace=5}Time wasted: 1.
{cps=50}At some point during the hunt, you attempt to show off your crossbow skills but end up failing miserably.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Crossbow skill — fail!{vspace=5}Time wasted: 1.
{cps=50}You're not inclined to waste time on diversions and decline the offer.
{cps=50}Your appearance fails to inspire trust; they ignore you and simply ride by.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — fail (required: 30)!
{cps=50}Dusk falls by the time you decide to return. You have no choice but to navigate your way back in the dark.
{cps=50}You move carefully and successfully avoid any danger.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Luck, Coordination — success!
{cps=50}As you walk by a large ravine, a careless step leads you to trip over a root, resulting in you tumbling headfirst into the chasm.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Luck, Coordination — fail!
{cps=50}The fall turns out to be quite a rough one, and you end up getting seriously hurt.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Concussion!

{cps=50}At the crossroads, you encounter a well-armed warrior riding a warhorse.
{cps=50}The stranger is keen to converse with you. He introduces himself as Jacques de Bovary, a wandering knight seeking a worthy adversary who can match him in martial skill.
{cps=50}In his own words, he has never lost once in over 300 duels — with none of his opponents even coming close to defeating him.
{cps=50}Pleased by your acceptance of his challenge, he nods in approval and invokes the Lord himself to witness this duel and bestow victory upon the most worthy.
{cps=50}While reciting his prayers, he turns his back to you and starts heading towards the opposite direction.
{cps=50}With now roughly 100 paces between you, he pivots to confront you, lowers the visor of his helmet, lifts his lance, and spurs his horse for a charge.
{cps=50}Realizing that a head-on clash with this steel colossus would be pure suicide, you decide to dodge his blow, relying on your agility.
{cps=50}The plan works, as you manage to evade his attack at the last second. The knight, surprised by your maneuver, clumsily spurs his mount, forcing it to stand on its hind legs. This move renders him defenseless for a couple of seconds.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility, Coordination — success!
{cps=50}Seizing this opportunity, you strike him with all your strength, knocking him out of the saddle and leveling the playing field...
{cps=50}The plan fails; you miss the timing and only partially evade the attack. A heavy blow of his lance knocks you down.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Concussion!
{cps=50}As you struggle on the ground, reality dawns on you: perhaps you've taken on more than you can handle.
{cps=50}You admit defeat and beg for mercy. The knight, honorable as he is, lets you live, satisfied with his victory.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Prestige lowered by 1!
{cps=50}Meanwhile, the knight prepares to charge at you once more. You're left with no option but to try the same defensive maneuver.
{cps=50}This time, you are successful, dodging the attack at the last second. The knight, surprised by your maneuver, clumsily spurs his mount, forcing it to stand on its hind legs. This move renders him defenseless for a couple of seconds.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility, Coordination — success!
{cps=50}Seizing this opportunity, you strike him with all your strength, knocking him out of the saddle and leveling the playing field...
{cps=50}But you fail again and end up on the receiving end of another heavy blow that knocks you down.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Broken leg!
{cps=50}As you struggle on the ground, reality dawns on you: perhaps you've taken on more than you can handle.

{cps=50}Seizing this opportunity, you strike him with all your strength, knocking him out of the saddle and leveling the playing field...
{cps=50}But you fail yet another time and receive the third consecutive heavy blow in full force. This one is powerful enough to not only knock you to the ground but also ensure that you won't be getting up anytime soon.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Maimed!
{cps=50}Realizing that you are in no shape to continue, the knight declares himself the winner of the duel.
{cps=50}He commends your courage and, after wishing you a speedy recovery, rides off.
{cps=50}You spend about half an hour recuperating on the ground before finding the strength to get back up and slowly walk back...
{cps=50}A duel with an ironclad knight does not really seem like something you fancy doing. You politely decline his challenge, preferring to sacrifice a bit of honor for the sake of your well-being.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 15!{vspace=5}Prestige lowered by 1!
{cps=50}Riding through a nearby forest, you catch the sounds of battle in the distance.
{cps=50}Not feeling particularly adventurous, you choose to disregard the sounds and carry on your journey.
{cps=50}You hurry towards the sounds and soon find yourself in a clearing where a knight is ferociously fighting several bandits.
{cps=50}Entirely focused on the fight, they don't notice you.
{cps=50}Not interested in supporting either side, you decide to simply walk away.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}Your sense of honor compels you to quickly rush to the knight's aid.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}Excited by the prospect of easy prey, you decide to aid the bandits.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 30!
{cps=50}He acknowledges that while you may not be a match for him in skill, your courage is commendable, which he considers the most important quality. With that, he bids farewell and takes his leave.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [fatigue_to_recover] Fatigue!
{cps=50}Intimidated by your ferocity, the enemies seemingly start having second thoughts about their decision to mess with you.
{cps=50}During the training session, an armor-bearer from the retinue of one of the knight-bannerets approaches you and your comrades. He seems to be seeking a sparring partner.
{cps=50}Once the sparring starts, the man, convinced in the superiority of his skill, acts disrespectfully, recklessly attempting all kinds of dangerous moves that could easily injure his partner.
{cps=50}His behavior gets even worse; when it's your turn to spar with him, he openly mocks you, repeatedly aiming his sword at your vital organs, stopping mere inches from your flesh.
{cps=50}Outraged by his actions, you try to tell him off.
{cps=50}The man simply laughs in your face. He adds that you're not only a coward but also a very clumsy one, and that you'd be better off with a broom in your hands rather than a sword.
{cps=50}At this moment, several more of his friends from the same retinue show up. Together, they force you and your comrades off the training grounds, leaving the insults unanswered and the training session unfinished.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Training failed!{vspace=5}Prestige lowered by 1!
{cps=50}Outraged by his actions, you decide to repay him in kind and start responding to his moves just as aggressively.
{cps=50}Your gumption catches him off-guard. As he clumsily dodges one of your lunges, he loses his balance and falls into the mud. Laughter erupts from your comrades and the numerous onlookers gathered around the training grounds.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Weapon skill — success!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!
{cps=50}But the skill gap is too big. Effortlessly dodging your clumsy lunge, the man trips you and sends you right into the mud — to the laughter of numerous onlookers.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Weapon skill — fail!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}As you get up from the ground, several more of his friends from the same retinue show up. Together, they force you and your comrades off the training grounds, leaving the insults unanswered and the training session unfinished.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Training failed!
{cps=50}You ignore his behavior.
{cps=50}Luckily, his recklessness does not injure anyone. However, the sparring proves to be poor practice, and the training session is ruined.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Training failed!
{cps=50}Several months into the campaign, your habit of looting the bodies of slain enemies for anything even remotely useful becomes widely known among your comrades.
{cps=50}The fact that you always get the best spoils does not sit well with many of them. On one occasion, a group of half a dozen approaches you in camp, eager to have a 'talk' with you.
{cps=50}Surrounding you from all sides, they give you a friendly pat on the shoulder and remind you that war is a team effort. And since one soldier cannot win a battle alone, one should not claim all the loot for themselves.
{cps=50}Thus, they conclude that it would be greatly appreciated if you recognized their contributions and — just as God decreed — shared some of your wealth with your fellow colleagues.
{cps=50}And if people think that you're getting more than they do, then perhaps they should also acknowledge that you're doing a lot more fighting than they do.
{cps=50}Such a retort obviously does not elicit a positive reaction. Staring daggers at you, they vow that you will pay one way or another — and if not with money, then with something far more valuable.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 30!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 30!

{cps=50}To boost soldiers' morale, the earl buys a couple of kegs of wine from a local merchant and treats all of his men to a jug for each.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Нeists allow you to engage in criminal activities in order to obtain valuable items.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Success depends on your characteristics and, to a lesser extent, luck. The tougher the heist, the greater your characteristics must be to ensure success. Similarly, the more ambitious the heist, the harsher the consequences for failure.
{cps=50}As someone who has been on the opposite side of the law more than once, you effortlessly establish contact with the local criminal underworld.
{cps=50}Impressed by your notoriety, they agree to work for you...

{cps=50}You probably came here as part of someone's retinue, correct?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — fail (required: 75)!
Overall, there are three stances — Offensive stance, Defensive stance, and Balanced stance.
Shield.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for actions with the shield (if your character has one).
Shield actions work similarly to feints, but their success primarily depends on the Strength stat of both the attacking and defending characters.
Shooting works a little bit differently from melee attacks. The hit chance solely depends on the character's crossbow skill and is additionally increased by the target's Fatigue level. No other stats or parameters influence the outcome of the crossbow shot.
Different types of bolts perform best against different targets. A crossbow loaded with a certain type of bolt can be freely reloaded with another type at any time.{vspace=5}Some of the bolts shot during combat can be picked back up during the looting phase.
The are five levels of Fatigue: Fresh, Winded, Tired, On Last Legs, and Exhausted. To progress from one level to the next, you have to deplete one full Stamina bar. The higher your maximum Stamina, the slower your Fatigue progresses.
The first Fatigue level ('Fresh') does not apply any penalties, but the next levels apply increasingly severe ones.{vspace=5}Fatigue penalties lower the accuracy of all your offensive actions as well as your chance to dodge enemy attacks.
Please note that physical exhaustion can easily undermine any advantages that a character might possess in equipment and skills. A man who can barely move his feet will not perform well in combat against fresh opponents.
Please note that most injuries inflicted on the player will be permanent until they are healed in camp.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}They both turn to you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}During the next several seconds, you find yourself thoroughly examined by two pairs of eyes.
{cps=50}You seriously want to try and get paid under this contract? Is that what you're saying?
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Alright, let's pretend for a moment that I do actually agree with you. But how the hell are we supposed to even get that money? Just go and ask for it?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 5!
{cps=50}I seriously doubt anyone in their right mind would mistake me for a knight... And you with that thuggish face of yours might at best come off as a knight's war horse...
{cps=50}What do you mean, dress up?{w}{vspace=5}And how the hell much is 'a bit'?
{cps=50}No way. I'm not taking part in anything like that. What if he's got family? Surely his wife and kids could use the money? I'm giving the contract to the sergeant — he'll know what to do with it.
{cps=50}Not everything in life is about money. There are things that are way more important.
{cps=50}Amazingly, this joke of a plan somehow works. The treasurer, occupied with some important business, barely glances at you and, after carefully checking the contract, hands you a hefty sack of gold — which you split with Bartholomew.{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}150 florins received!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}The ship sinks before it has sailed. The treasurer needs but one glance to realize that you're not who you're pretending to be.{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — fail (required: 30)!
{cps=50}You stutter as you explain that you accidentally found the contract and are definitely not after the money, before quickly hightailing it out of there.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}I'm ready.{vspace=5}To save your relationship with a girl whom I've never met and whose father has been incidentally spying on us on behalf of the enemy.

{cps=50}Alright. Let's see what you've got there. Probably all stolen, eh?

{cps=50}To everyone's surprise, the fight, which was expected to quickly end in your utter defeat, drags on. It has turned into a serious duel between evenly matched warriors, neither of whom is strong enough to gain the upper hand.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}Hearing Ruffin's breathing grow heavier, you carefully prepare a decisive attack that could turn the tide of the duel.
{cps=50}However, just as you're about to strike, a sudden burst of pain shoots through your leg. You lose your balance and collapse to the ground.
{cps=50}Wincing in pain, you manage to make out its source: a treacherous attack from one of Ruffin's men, a foreign-looking mercenary of prodigious size.
{cps=50}Ruffin, who maintained a cool head throughout the entire fight until this moment, displays visible irritation at the intervention.
{cps=50}What the hell, Andreas!? I don't remember telling you to do a goddamn thing.{w}{vspace=5}I had the bastard.
{cps=50}In danger?{w}{vspace=5}I was just playing with him — I haven't even drawn my second blade.{w}{vspace=5}It was amusing to see my own blood again... It's been a while.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}After asking your men whether any of them still wish to voice any grievances and receiving no response, Ruffin shrugs his shoulders, turns around, and walks away in the company of his comrades.
{cps=50}As he walks past you, he slows down for a second and whispers:{vspace=5}'Welcome to the war, son.'
{cps=50}When the mercenaries ride off, your comrades rush to you to administer first aid. Although you did not emerge victorious from this battle, the fact that you found the courage to challenge Ruffin has certainly increased your standing among your peers.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Acknowledging that there is probably nothing worthwhile left in the village, you nevertheless send your men to inspect the houses.{w} As expected, they return empty-handed, but not without news.
{cps=50}Sadly, it was the type of news you would have preferred never to hear at all...
{cps=50}It appears that Ruffin's men not only plundered Conques, appropriating what rightfully belonged to you, but also slaughtered most of the inhabitants.{w} And then they safely got away right under your nose.
{cps=50}You understand that you are not to blame, given that you were completely outmatched. Nonetheless, you vow that the next encounter with Ruffin will see him brutally held to account for his actions.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added- [blood_debt.name!ti].
{cps=50}Your squad returns in complete silence.
{cps=50}When you attempt to recount what occurred, she shuts you up, telling you that you need to conserve your strength. The girl remains by your bedside for the remainder of the evening, tending to your many wounds.
{cps=50}She is initially unreceptive to your attempts at conversation, but after a few hours, when your life is no longer in jeopardy, she relents. By midnight, you find yourselves engaged in a conversation about everything under the sun.
{cps=50}When you finally fall asleep, Cecilia sits next to you for a long time, watching over you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 15!

{cps=50}Bernard passes away a few days later, his will to live extinguished. Thus the story of House de Châtillon comes to an end.

{cps=50}You wonder what to do next...
{cps=50}And the answer is obvious.
{cps=50}You never chased a military career, never dreamed of campaigns, battles, and glory. But as soon as fate tore you away from the dull little routine existence that was your old life, where every day was a copy of the previous one, and thrust you into the blazing flames of war, where everything was so new and visceral, everything fell into place.
{cps=50}You did not choose this life — it chose you. And now, no matter how hard you try, you cannot imagine yourself doing anything else.
{cps=50}You are a man of war. And men like you only rest when their severed heads roll on the ground.
{cps=50}A lot of things still lay ahead of you. More lost friends and felled enemies. More journeys and epic battles. More glorious days. More counts, dukes, and kings seeking your aid and honoring your name. More perilous quests demanding you to venture to the end of the world to accomplish the impossible.

{cps=50}Somewhere around here, within the expansive deserts separating Damietta and El-Mansour, your trail vanishes.
{cps=50}Nobody knows how you met your end.{vspace=5}But that hardly matters, as there is no one to mourn you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 2 of 11.
{cps=50}Wounded, Jones drops his weapon and jumps into a nearby pond...
{cps=50}Your vision darkens, and you meet your death.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}All stats lowered by 2!{vspace=5}Time lost: 3.
{cps=50}After being scolded by the command for postponing a task of high importance, you hastily make your way to the abbey.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Arriving closer, you get an opportunity to take a better look at the place. But there seems to be nothing interesting to look at. An ordinary rural life is going on on the pre-castle territory made of about a dozen houses. The peasants, going about their business, are observed from the castle walls by the crossbowmen, and some lord's banner is flying above the keep.

{cps=50}While travelling around the local territories, you run into an antiquarian. Upon seeing you, the trader immediately starts to tout his goods, promising to offer a good price and urging you to take a look.
{cps=50}You bid farewell to the trader and continue the journey.
{cps=50}Thanks to your talent as a huntsman, you manage to get some game for sale.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}20 florins received.
{cps=50}The curiosity takes over, and you make an attempt to get inside.
{cps=50}The massive and half-rotten oak door that blocks the entrance does not budge - no matter how hard you try.
{cps=50}A more God-fearing person would have probably interpreted it as a sign from above and walked away, but you refuse to be stopped by something like that. And, with a little ingenuity, you eventually make your way inside through a hole in the roof.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Low virtue - success!{vspace=5}Time lost: 1!
{cps=50}You then deftly jump down and find yourself in complete darkness.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Coordination - success!
{cps=50}You then jump down into the darkness of the crypt, land poorly, and end up with an injury.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Coordination - failure!{vspace=5}Vitality reduced by 2!
{cps=50}Once the eyes adjust to the dark, you take a good look around.
{cps=50}Unfortunately, there seems to be nothing particularly interesting inside the crypt. Apparently, anything of value had already been taken out of here long before you arrived.
{cps=50}However, after spending some time properly searching around, you eventually manage to find something valuable.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Luck - success!
{cps=50}You spend some time searching around but only end up finding a couple of pieces of ancient military equipment.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Luck - fail!
{cps=50}However, no matter how much effort is put in, you still cannot open the massive half-rotten oak door.
{cps=50}Interpreting it as a sign from above, you abandon these attempts and get back on the road.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Low Virtue - fail!
{cps=50}You decide to stay away from it and get back on the road.
{cps=50}When the time comes to get out, you realize that you won’t be able to leave the crypt the same way you got into it.
{cps=50}In the end, failing to defeat the door with strength, you are forced to overcome it with perseverance by spending several long hours gradually pushing it open half an inch at a time.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Time lost: 1! Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}This decision, however, ends up being a bad one, as, about half an hour later, you find yourself absolutely lost without even a hint of an idea where you might be and where to go.
{cps=50}The only available option in this case is to simply go somewhere - which is what you do.
{cps=50}After about an hour and a half more of wandering around you finally stumble upon a tiny village.
{cps=50}The locals turn out to be friendly... Perhaps even too friendly - despite all your pleas to simply show the way, they treat you as a dear guest and practically make you taste the village hospitality to the fullest.
{cps=50}Eventually you are shown the road back, but only after a visit to the bathhouse and a subsequent feast with half a dozen of dishes.
{cps=50}All this obviously has a positive effect on your health, but also eats up quite a bit of your time.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality increased by 1!{vspace=5}Time left: 3.
{cps=50}While resting, you notice a small caravan of three wagons loaded with a variety of goods moving in your direction.
{cps=50}Having an eye for dark affairs, you immediately notice that, despite being heavily loaded, the caravan is practically defenseless. Excluding several plump traders who are clearly not fighters, it is guarded only by a couple of goons with average at best equipment.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Low Virtue - success!
{cps=50}Such meager security could probably protect the caravan from a couple of lowly thieves or poachers, but not from you.
{cps=50}This tasty fruit is ripe for the taking...
{cps=50}You sound very intimidating and look the part too. All of that creates a highly believable impression of a man who has to be given what he wants. Or something very bad will happen.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige - total success!
{cps=50}The traders, scared to death, offer you 250 florins for the right of safe passage.
{cps=50}You sound very intimidating, and you look very much like a man who should not be messed with.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige - partial success!
{cps=50}The traders, scared to death, offer you 100 florins for the right of safe passage.
{cps=50}You sound very intimidating, but your appearance doesn't inspire any kind of respect.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige - fail!
{cps=50}The traders tell their goons to deal with you.
{cps=50}You take their offer and let them pass by.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[hunt_2_caravan] florins received!
{cps=50}This tiny sum is not nearly enough, and you reach for the weapon in order to take the cargo by force.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 20!
{cps=50}You decide to avoid unnecessary bloodshed and let the caravan pass.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!

{cps=50}You arrive in Lindisfarne...
{cps=50}One evening, while drinking with Jones, you tell him that you would be glad to have an opportunity to make some extra money.
{cps=50}In response, Jones reveals that he - by pure chance - has a great suggestion on how this could be done.
{cps=50}In the vicinity of Greenwich there is a road that is actively used by traders and caravanners.
{cps=50}Naturally, given the turbulent situation in the area, most of them travel in groups and under guard, but there are also lone daredevils.
{cps=50}All you'll have to do is hide somewhere secluded by the road and wait until one of these swims right into your hands.
{cps=50}And then it would be enough to just scare the poor guy well, and he will give everything up himself - you won’t even have sin on your conscience.
{cps=50}You agree and at the appointed hour, in the company of Jones and a couple of his friends, take a position by the road.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 20!

{cps=50}One evening, while drinking with Jones, you tell him that you would be glad to have an opportunity to make some extra money.
{cps=50}In response, Jones reveals that he - by pure chance - has information about a place where this can be done.
{cps=50}It's about an alchemical laboratory located not far from the Caldwell estate - or rather, its ruins now.
{cps=50}The laboratory's products are in good demand throughout the area, so that place is bound to have something worth taking.
{cps=50}The security of that place was previously handled by the Caldwells' men, so now, considering the latest developments, you don’t have to worry about any danger - you can just go in, put a knife to the owner’s throat and take whatever you like. There will be no one to protect him anyway.

{cps=50}In response, Jones says that - by pure chance - he has a couple of contacts among the local criminals who gave him an interesting tip.
{cps=50}About a certain man who lives in a village near Chippenham Castle and makes a living by breeding horses.
{cps=50}Although his house does not look all that affluent on the outside, according to information from Jones' friends, the man regularly did business with the marquis and his knights. So he simply had to be making some substantial profits.
{cps=50}Now that neither the marquis nor his knights are around anymore, no one will stop you from visiting his house and gently asking to share some of this dirty and ill-gotten money.

{cps=50}Lowering his voice, he cautiously adds that the mercenary heading your way looks suspiciously like Ruffin - one of Count Canterbury's confidants, a man with a reputation of a ruthless cutthroat who has killed enough people in his lifetime to fill a graveyard.
{cps=50}The comrade implores you not to risk provoking him, for, otherwise, you could easily become an addition to the list of his victims.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The mercenary's expressionless face is covered in numerous scars, and his armor - in chips and dents.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}He looks like a man who has been through a hundred battles and stared death in the face more than once.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}His piercing gaze makes you uneasy.
{cps=50}And who the hell are you fleabags?
{cps=50}It is your parents who are fleabags. And we are foragers from Earl Northampton's squad, arrived to Conques to requisition provisions as ordered by the King of England.
{cps=50}So unless you want to get in big trouble with serious people, have your men unload the sacks and drag them all here. We'll be taking it all.
{cps=50}If you are fast enough, I'll do you a favor and won't tell anyone about this incident.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Huh. I don't even know what is more pathetic - your insults or intimidation attempts.
{cps=50}Although come to think of it, I do. It is your appearance.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Interested in the discussion, Ruffin's men and members of your squad come closer, forming a ring around you and stripping the conversation of confidentiality.
{cps=50}You look like a stinking swineherd who fancied himself a warrior instead of sticking to cleaning up manure.
{cps=50}Watch your tongue. I'm here on the King's orders, and I will not tolerate...
{cps=50}You will. You will shut up, and you will tolerate.
{cps=50}Tolerate that I called you a stinky swineherd in front of all your men. And the fact that we took provisions from this village, you will tolerate it too.
{cps=50}I also might just spit in your face right now, and you'd tolerate it all the same. And neither you nor any of your ragamuffin friends are going to do anything about it.
{cps=50}If, of course, none of you wish to end up in the mud with a belly ripped open.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ruffin's hand rests on the hilt of his sword, eloquently demonstrating his willingness to fight.
{cps=50}Isn't that right?
{cps=50}With a belly ripped open, you say?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The mercenary's insolence has crossed all imaginable boundaries, and you're not going to forgive him for disrespecting you like that. Especially in front of a few dozen people.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You draw your weapon.
{cps=50}I'll teach you to watch your mouth.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}Doubt it.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your assumption that mentioning the names of the king and the earl would have an effect on the mercenary has clearly failed.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You don't wish to get into a fight from which you are unlikely to emerge victorious, and so you prefer to simply stay silent.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Between blood and humiliation, you choose the latter.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 25!
{cps=50}That's what I am talking about.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}With a contemptuous grin, Ruffin spits right on your boots to the cheers and jeers of the rest of the mercenaries.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You remain silent all the same.
{cps=50}Good boy.{w}{vspace=5}Here. It's your consolation prize. So you don't have to return completely empty-handed.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ruffin pats you on the cheek and tosses a coin to the ground. Then, with a smirk, he turns around and gives his men a command to pack up.
{cps=50}This scene clearly does not bode well for your reputation among your comrades...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige lowered by 3!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}Although, judging by the looks on their faces, they are well aware that you all just got off very easily.
{cps=50}You leave it in the mud and swear to yourself that the next time you meet with Ruffin, you will make him pay for this insult.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Boiling with rage, you intend to respond with a blow to his jaw, but he is faster - and so he sends you to the ground with a swift and sudden leg sweep.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Before you can get up, Ruffin delivers another kick, breaking your nose and ramming your head into the dirt with the sole of his boot.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[storyroll!ti]
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The fall and the massive blow to the head completely disorient you and deprive you of any possibility to continue combat.
{cps=50}How do you lads like it? I've picked it up from de Montfort.
{cps=50}I'll demonstrate it to him later as well. Got a feeling the old man is going to love it.
{cps=50}Standing over you with a satisfied smirk, Ruffin suddenly, for a second, changes his expression. It is as if the situation he ended up in suddenly became familiar to him.
{cps=50}As if he had already stood over someone once before exactly the same, reveling in his victory.
{cps=50}Or someone had stood over him.
{cps=50}Throwing a brief glance at you, he abruptly turns around and gives his men a command to pack up.
{cps=50}A minute later, the mercenaries are in their saddles, and, once again singing out their song, they ride off to the northwest, leaving you behind.
{cps=50}While you recover and get out of the mud, your men scatter throughout the village, trying not to meet your eyes.
{cps=50}Almost in every house you are greeted by the owners...{w} with blank stares of their cold dead eyes.
{cps=50}Ruffin's men not only plundered Conques, appropriating what should have been yours, but also slaughtered almost all of its inhabitants.
{cps=50}If you were a more righteous man, you would have certainly been horrified and disgusted by what you saw and would want to take a brutal revenge on Ruffin for what he did.
{cps=50}But excessive virtue is not on your merit list, so this bloody scene has absolutely no effect on you. Life is cheap. Especially that of a stranger, and especially at war.
{cps=50}However, the humiliation that Ruffin subjected you to in front of other people is not something you are willing to forgive anyone for.
{cps=50}And thus, standing in the middle of a devastated village, surrounded by dozens of bloody bodies, you vow to yourself to take vengeance for your tarnished honor.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [blood_debt.name!ti].

{cps=50}In an unexpected burst of candor, he admits to you that the journey to the Holy Land has not just failed to bring him riches but, on the contrary, ruined him. So now he is considering entering the service of some lord or any other solvent employer.
{cps=50}The only conditions of importance to him, besides the guarantee of timely payments of wages, are the pious demeanor of his future commander and the absence of any tasks, the fulfillment of which could cast a shadow on his honor as a knight and as a Christian.

{cps=50}As you move through the forest, you suddenly notice a glint of metal at the top of one of the trees. Taking a closer look, you realize that it is coming from a magpie's nest, which apparently contains something valuable.
{cps=50}Its contents become your trophy.
{cps=50}And it is so wide off the mark that you completely lose faith in your ability to hit the nest — and decide not to waste any more of your bolts.
{cps=50}Covered with numerous twigs, the tree looks like it would be easy to climb up - and you get into action.
{cps=50}With a steady grip on the twigs, you rush upwards.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength, Luck check passed!{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!

Duel with a squad member
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Nodding, you are about to agree, but some unknown force stops you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You try to overcome yourself, but in vain — the mind gives commands, yet the body simply refuses to carry them out.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue check failed!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The mere thought of having to torture and torment an unarmed prisoner to force him to betray his comrades causes you deep aversion. Aversion you cannot overcome.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Carefully choosing your words, you appeal to Alice.
{cps=50}Milady, I am a warrior, not an executioner or a torturer.
{cps=50}If I have to spill another man's blood, I would much rather do so in fair combat — when he is armed and stands face-to-face against me.
{cps=50}I'm not going to torture or disfigure some puny yokel just to extract information that would doom his comrades and tarnish whatever minuscule trace of honor he may possess.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Obviously surprised by this answer, the countess looks at you for a few seconds in total bewilderment.
{cps=50}Looks like we're having a misunderstanding.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}I've done my research on you.{w} And since I couldn't find any record of you being knighted in the London registry books...
{cps=50}...I can draw one of two conclusions.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You feel cold steel in her voice.
{cps=50}Either you're not who you say you are.{w} Which means there's nothing stopping me from ordering my men to execute you on the spot for impersonating an honorable nobleman.
{cps=50}Or, you've been knighted just recently and haven't yet realized that holding a noble title implies certain...{w} corporate solidarity.
{cps=50}It's a simple concept, [name]. There's {b}us{/b} and there's {b}them{/b}.
{cps=50}A king's job is to rule, a knight's job is to fight, a priest's job is to pray for the forgiveness of our sins.
{cps=50}And a peasant's job is to obediently serve without ever raising his head.
{cps=50}Their souls are tainted by avarice and envy. They will always loathe us because that's in their essence.
{cps=50}The very second they stop fearing us, their hatred will drive them to pick up arms against us.
{cps=50}Once that happens, whether you have treated them fairly or not wouldn't matter. You'd be beheaded along with everyone else — simply because you're not one of them.{w} Because you do not come from the same filth they do.
{cps=50}Because you're more virtuous than them.{w}Because you're better than them.
{cps=50}Because your blood is purer.
{cps=50}By killing those thugs in the Greenwich forests, you are protecting not only my estate but also your right to live the life you deserve.
{cps=50}You know it better than anyone that sometimes you have to fight for your right to live — and often not in the cleanest of ways.
{cps=50}When your opponent is a man of honor, you can deal with him according to the laws of honor.
{cps=50}But when a rootless, Devil-possessed mass of yokels rises up against you, rules and laws lose their relevance. For they themselves know none.
{cps=50}So I will say it one more time.{w} Do me a favor; pull yourself together and do what the situation calls for.
{cps=50}He'll tell me everything he knows. Even if I have to rip it out of him with red-hot steel.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue reduced by 15!
{cps=50}That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The countess' face again lights up with a carefree smile — a stark contrast to the words flying out of her lips.
{cps=50}Now go and torture him to death if you have to.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}In an instant, the faces of the comrades who fought alongside you in France flash before your eyes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}They were not barons, marquises, or nobles, but their lowly status did not prevent them from climbing impregnable walls under a hail of arrows, bolts, and stones. They did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives in a foreign land, many leagues from home, just to satiate somebody else's ambitions and protect somebody else's honor.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As rage builds within you, you feel your blood starting to boil.
{cps=50}Those vile, greedy, and envious yokels, whom you so despise, stood shoulder to shoulder with me under the walls of Cambrai.
{cps=50}Not so long ago I too was one of those people you despise so much. If you believe that ranks and titles will make me forget where I come from, you are severely mistaken.
{cps=50}However, I do not expect you to understand me.
{cps=50}Those born and raised on silk sheets, who've never known hunger or cold, will never understand that beyond the high walls of their castles and estates, there are people too. And they are the same as you.
{cps=50}True, the Lord might not have blessed them with fortune or noble blood, but that does not mean that they can be treated like cattle.
{cps=50}And, goddamn you, my honor will never allow me to torture an unarmed defenseless prisoner!
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}But what can you know about honor...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The last sentence escapes your lips involuntarily, and you instantly regret saying it.
{cps=50}Pardon me, countess, I didn't mean to...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Feeling that you may have gone too far, you try to make amends quickly, but Alyssa unceremoniously interrupts you. It appears she has no intention of hearing anything further you have to say.
{cps=50}My oh my...{w} And to think I even started making plans about you.
{cps=50}Father told me that worthy people are found only among noble families, but I, being a silly girl, didn't believe him.
{cps=50}He was right yet again.
{cps=50}I have already told you that there is no place for cowards and slobs in my house.{w} But there is also no place for filth.
{cps=50}Get out of my face, or I will order my men to tie you up and throw you into the cellar. So you can keep good company to that yokel friend of yours.
{cps=50}And if you ever dare to show up at Greenwich again, I'll have your head chopped off and put on a pike for everyone to see.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) lowered by 150!

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You find Alyssa focusing on a map. When she sees you, she gets straight to the point — without greeting you.
{cps=50}Here. This place should be somewhere around here...
{cps=50}To be honest, I still can't believe that we're about to finally catch that scoundrel.
{cps=50}Just a couple of weeks ago, he and his men had the entire area shaking in terror, but now it's us who have got them by the throat.
{cps=50}...and the best part is: they don't even realize it yet.
{cps=50}Hold your horses, milady. Don't start celebrating too soon.
{cps=50}If this Duncan fella really is at least half as dangerous as you've described him, then this is far from over.
{cps=50}He is bloodthirsty and resourceful, but his strategic acumen extends only to setting up crude ambushes.
{cps=50}He and his men are no match for you.
{cps=50}My people are ready to march and await only for your command. Go and put an end to this story.
{cps=50}I will pray for you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [robbin_the_hood.name!ti].
{cps=50}Congratulations on another victory.
{cps=50}Call that intuition, luck, or anything else, but I know a hawk from a handsaw.
{cps=50}One glance at you was enough for me to tell that you're exactly the man who can and will bring law and order back to Greenwich.
{cps=50}Exactly the man I need.
{cps=50}Thank you, milady.
{cps=50}That bastard Duncan is awaiting his fate in an iron cage. Half of his men have been slain, and the rest captured. The bandits are no more.
{cps=50}Looks like Greenwich can finally sleep peacefully now.
{cps=50}You have no idea how grateful I am to you. The events of the past few months have turned my life into one endless nightmare from which I could never awaken.
{cps=50}Now, at last, I am awake. All the horrors are gone like a bad dream.
{cps=50}It's all thanks to you.{w} Thank you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 30!
{cps=50}The code of honor compels me to aid a fair lady...{w} Especially one as fair as you are.
{cps=50}No. No more ladies. You can call me Alyssa now.
{cps=50}As you say... Alyssa.
{cps=50}Well now, I too remember my promise. In all honesty, I'm not particularly excited about the young prince's ambitious endeavor.
{cps=50}My father, in his time at the royal court, was no stranger to intrigues and conspiracies around the throne. According to him, these machinations taught him a simple lesson.
{cps=50}As long as your head is still on your shoulders, you can consider yourself a winner. And as long as you are a winner, it's never too late to back out of anything that is looking too risky.
{cps=50}I...
{cps=50}Shut up. I know everything.
{cps=50}If you were a man who backed out at the first sign of risk, you wouldn't be standing here right now.
{cps=50}You can count on my help.
{cps=50}Thanks.{w} I...
{cps=50}Didn't I tell you to shut up!?
{cps=50}Even my limited understanding of military strategy tells me that the prince doesn't have any more time to waste.{vspace=5}And neither do you.
{cps=50}There's no guarantee that I will ever see you again.
{cps=50}So I suggest you don't waste our precious time talking...{w} And instead help me get out of this dress.

{cps=50}As you ponder the assignment received from Alyssa, memories of your visit to Chippenham come to mind.
{cps=50}The marquis' residence is a medium-sized castle — fortified, but still not mighty enough to be a truly impregnable citadel.
{cps=50}Taking it by storm seems like a doable task, especially in case of defenders' small numbers or low competence.
{cps=50}But otherwise, if the castle suddenly turns out to be well-defended, a lightning assault would be out of the question.
{cps=50}You delve deeper into your memory and recall crossbowmen on the walls and towers, as well as some generally capable-looking guards at the gates.
{cps=50}After some estimations, you figure that with about fifty men with experience in siege warfare under your command, such defense could be overcome with a swift frontal assault.
{cps=50}Another option that occurs to you last is a covert infiltration.
{cps=50}If you can find someone among the inhabitants of the castle who would be willing to open the side gate under the cover of darkness and let you in, the matter could be solved with a very small force.
{cps=50}The only difficulty lies in finding this most mysterious resident of Chippenham, who may have an axe to grind with Duncan...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough militiamen!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You need to mount three successful assaults on Windsor before you're ready to tackle Chippenham...
{cps=50}You decide to take Chippenham by a determined frontal assault.
{cps=50}After launching a diversionary attack with your main forces and waiting for the castle defenders to engage, you, with a small squad and a single siege ladder, rush towards the castle from the opposite side...
{cps=50}This simple trick works - you manage to climb the wall unhindered and catch the few Duncan's men who were left to guard this side by surprise.
{cps=50}All that is left for you to do is deal with them before they can call for reinforcements...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough militiamen!
{cps=50}Having enlisted Jones' support, you decide to sneak into Chippenham under the cover of night.
{cps=50}Jones proves true to his word and, at the appointed hour, actually helps you to infiltrate the castle undetected.
{cps=50}As you move through the corridors and towers, you kill the sentries one by one. After a quarter of an hour, Chippenham Castle is almost under your control.
{cps=50}Only Duncan's bodyguards, who guard the marquis's private quarters, are able to offer some semblance of organized resistance.
{cps=50}You arrive in Chippenham to hire people...
{cps=50}Bearing in mind Jones' previously expressed displeasure with Duncan, you delicately inquire about his perspective on the possibility of the new marquis disappearing and being replaced by someone more... convenient.
{cps=50}Jones, being quite well versed in trickery and intrigue, quickly grasps what you're getting at and suggests that you don't beat around the bush, but make him a concrete offer.
{cps=50}Without going into any confidential details of Alyssa's concocted plan, you bring him up to speed.
{cps=50}Jones states that he is willing to assist you in eliminating Duncan - he will secretly let you and your squad in the castle grounds, as well as neutralize some of the guards while you deal with the marquis.
{cps=50}His services will cost 5,000 florins. He also wishes to obtain a well-paid position at the court of the new marquis.
{cps=50}You agree to his terms and hand over 5,000 florins.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}5,000 florins lost!
{cps=50}Then you shake hands and work out the details of the attack.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [overthrow.name!ti].
{cps=50}The stated terms — especially the amount of money Jones requested — seem unacceptable to you, so you refuse.
{cps=50}Jones shrugs and says that he would be glad to meet you again in case you suddenly change your mind...
{cps=50}In the meantime, he will double the castle guard and inform Duncan of the rumors of an impending assassination attempt against him.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!

{cps=50}Well, this is definitely better than nothing, I guess. Thanks for that.
{cps=50}Erhm... Do I look like a butcher or something?
{cps=50}And what is it exactly that I'm supposed to do with this thing if I get attacked by an angry Flemish soldier?
{cps=50}Teach him how to carve up a pork carcass?
{cps=50}Honestly, I expected better from you. And from myself, to be quite frank...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 3!
{cps=50}I'll have to settle for that, I guess.
{cps=50}Such an elegant sword! Where did you get it?
{cps=50}Looks a bit unfamiliar but very impressive nonetheless.
{cps=50}If I end up getting captured with a thing like that, they might take me for a foreigner and spare me...
{cps=50}Trust me, milady, should {b}you{/b} get captured by a mob of angry soldiers, the curvature of your sword will be the last thing they'll pay attention to.
{cps=50}You think so?
{cps=50}Well, in this case, I will have to rely on you to protect me.{vspace=5}Thank you for the sword.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 7!
{cps=50}I haven't got it yet. But I am working on it.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Unfortunately, my attempts to get you a sword were unsuccessful. However, do not worry, because in the process of searching, I stumbled upon something much better...
{cps=50}This axe!
{cps=50}...{w} But why would I need an axe?{w} Who do you think I am, a lumberjack!?
{cps=50}Thank you for your kind offer, but you can keep it for yourself. I'll make do somehow.{w} And if it was a joke, it wasn't funny.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 3!
{cps=50}Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find a sword.
{cps=50}But have no worries!
{cps=50}I got something even better.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}And what might that be, I hate to ask?
{cps=50}A very good club! Our sergeant says that it's the best weapon, and he's a man you can trust.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}......{w}{vspace=5}...
{cps=50}Alright. Give it here.{w}{vspace=5}Can you come a bit closer? I'd like to test how good this club of yours actually is.

{cps=50}If I understand correctly, doctors should be experts in everything related to the preparation of various poisons and antidotes...
{cps=50}Well, I would definitely not call myself an expert in this matter, but I have certain knowledge. What's the matter?
{cps=50}How can I put it...{w} I need poison for... To do one thing basically.
{cps=50}What 'thing'?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell Cecilia the truth about John Hoggard, who gets on everyone's nerves, as well as your and the sergeant's plan to teach him a lesson.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Although you are trying to smooth over the rough edges, your story still terrifies the girl and she flatly refuses to help.
{cps=50}Are you out of your mind?! Do you even understand that if you mix up the dosage, you can easily send a person straight to God?!
{cps=50}And if this happens, and - judging by the level of your competence in this matter - it will definitely happen, then I will be guilty too! I will be an accomplice in a crime!
{cps=50}Don't even think about asking me for something like that anymore.
{cps=50}Umm...
{cps=50}There is a lot of talk in the camp that French archers and crossbowmen often use poisoned arrows and bolts.
{cps=50}Soooo...
{cps=50}And, well, in order to prepare for future dangers, so to speak, my comrades and I decided to practice sucking out poison from each other...
{cps=50}We found something to suck it out from, but there are still some difficulties with the poison...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cecilia tries to keep a straight face and hardly manages not to laugh.
{cps=50}What a touching story.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 5!
{cps=50}I don't believe a single word you say. But it's a nice try, I almost bought it.
{cps=50}I'm sorry that I can't tell you everything, but I really, really need your help...
{cps=50}Oh, Dio, okay, so be it - I'll think about what can be done. But first, get me that damn sword I asked for!
{cps=50}Oh, Dio, okay, so be it - you helped me with this stupid sword and I don't want to stay in your debt.

{cps=50}About my wounded friend...
{cps=50}Your friend is an extremely stubborn person. Only miserable bits of life remained in his body, but he clung to them as if with the grip of a wild animal. To be honest, another man in his place would have died long ago.
{cps=50}That means that he will be fine, doesn't it?
{cps=50}I don't remember saying anything like that.
{cps=50}More precisely - maybe he will be fine, but only if he gets treatment as soon as possible. He is on the verge of death, and any delay in his case can easily turn out to be fatal.
{cps=50}I beg you, tell me that you will treat him!
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}All right, so be it - I'll take it upon myself. But I will consider it contract work, and contract work has a price.
{cps=50}Just tell me how much.
{cps=50}As usual. 50 florins.
{cps=50}Deal. With peace of mind, I am trusting you with his life.
{cps=50}Do not rush it. We still have one major problem.
{cps=50}All right, so be it - I'll take him upon myself. But we still have one major problem.
{cps=50}Due to the overwhelming number of wounded, we have serious problems with medicines - there are simply not enough of them for everyone. The situation is worsened by the fact that your friend might develop sepsis...{w} I think you understand what I mean...
{cps=50}Just tell me what you need to save him and I'll get it.
{cps=50}These are honorable words...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 5!
{cps=50}But I'm afraid it's not that simple. Of course, I will make a list of everything necessary, but not all that is needed can be acquired with a snap of the fingers - otherwise, I would have done it myself.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The tragic situation in which Bartholomew found himself leaves you no other options but to seek help from an experienced physician, and Cecilia is the first person who comes to your mind.
{cps=50}Cecilia, I desperately need your help. My friend was badly wounded during the assault. Now he is in the infirmary, but the doctors there are overworked and no one really takes care of him. I'm afraid they'll just let him die...
{cps=50}Do you think I have nothing else to do? I’m almost as busy as those doctors are! If you think that your friend is the only one who was seriously hurt, then I can assure you that this is not the case.
{cps=50}Many knights received dangerous wounds and many of them are in need of urgent help. Take the son of Lord Canterbury, for example - the poor fellow took a crossbow bolt in his throat... I almost had to sew his head back.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You can clearly tell by the exhausted look of the girl that she is not deceiving you. But since it is about your friend, you are not going to give in.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You keep on persuading and begging, and after half an hour, Cecilia finally gives up, promising to see what can be done for him. And if it is possible at all...

{cps=50}I've safely retrieved it from the Lindisfarne monks, but then Canterbury's men swooped in and...
{cps=50}And I lost it...
{cps=50}What do you mean, 'lost it'?
{cps=50}It's not like it's some button or copper florin that could fall out of your pocket without you noticing.
{cps=50}My apologies, sire...{w} I don't know how it happened.

{cps=50}Where's the sword, [name]?
{cps=50}Oh well... That means he won the first round.
{cps=50}This wasn't entirely unexpected, but I still had hoped for the best.
{cps=50}Alas, it is what it is.
{cps=50}Let that be a lesson for all of us — and by 'all of us', I mean you, [name] — that we must not forget whom we're dealing with.
{cps=50}Canterbury is as smart as he is ruthless. We cannot underestimate him.
{cps=50}No matter what we do, we always have to be ready for the worst.
{cps=50}Well said.
{cps=50}We might have let the sword slip through our hands — and you know who I mean by 'we', [name] — but we absolutely cannot let the same happen to Caldwell's daughter.
{cps=50}We can't afford any more mistakes.
{cps=50}And when I say 'we', [name]...
{cps=50}I got it, sire.
{cps=50}I won't fail you again.

{cps=50}Jones, who happened to be nearby, also provides some helpful advice...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Assault plan improved by 1!
{cps=50}In any case, we now hold the initiative. However, we mustn't become overly confident.
{cps=50}The closer the dirty paw of royal justice gets to the tender udder of Canterbury's political ambitions, the more dangerous he will become.
{cps=50}As for you, [name], since you've already proven yourself so well at Windsor, I'm temporarily appointing you commandant of the town. Something tells me it will be safe under your watch.
{cps=50}Organize the defense and, whenever possible, continue to gather troops - for there are no excess soldiers. Especially now.
{cps=50}As I already said - we hold the initiative now, but anything can be expected from Canterbury.
{cps=50}You seize the opportunity to reveal to him the true purpose of your visit to Hadley and ask him to support Prince Edward in the war for the crown.
{cps=50}These words infuriate the baron, and he angrily declares that he is never going to forgive the offenses caused to him by the royal house.
{cps=50}However, his anger eventually wears off, and the baron admits that although he does not wish to stand with the crown prince, he is personally indebted to you.
{cps=50}And since you, according to both your deeds and status, are a decent person - he is willing to entrust a part of his forces and resources to you personally.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Baron of Colchester agrees to support you in the war!{vspace=5}5,000 florins received!{vspace=5}Reputation (earl) increased by 15!

{cps=50}But wasn't he killed in Greenwich just a couple of weeks ago?{vspace=5}I saw him beaten to death with my own eyes!
{cps=50}The marquis, I suppose.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}He's a dangerous person, that Duncan.

{cps=50}But once you assure him that, along with a salary, he will also have the opportunity to plunder Windsor for spoils, his expression changes.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue is reduced by 10!
{cps=50}Jones states that he is willing to assist you in eliminating Duncan - he will secretly let you and your squad in the castle grounds, as well as neutralize some of the guards while you deal with the marquis.
{cps=50}His services will cost 5,000 florins. He also wishes to obtain a well-paid position at the court of the new marquis.
{cps=50}You agree to his terms and hand over 5,000 florins.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}5,000 florins lost!
{cps=50}Then you shake hands and work out the details of the attack.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [overthrow.name!ti].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}The stated terms — especially the amount of money Jones requested — seem unacceptable to you, so you refuse.
{cps=50}Jones shrugs and says that he would be glad to meet you again in case you suddenly change your mind...
{cps=50}In the meantime, he will double the castle guard and inform Duncan of the rumors of an impending assassination attempt against him.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Castle guard has been reinforced!
{cps=50}You hand over the promised sum.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}2500 florins lost.
{cps=50}Having fulfilled your promise, you are about to go on your way when, in a fit of unexpected frankness, Jones claims that he isn't entirely content working for Duncan...
{cps=50}...and wouldn't mind serving someone else, not just alone, but alongside a dozen or two comrades — seasoned ruffians and adventurers.
{cps=50}When you inquire about the cause of his discontent, Jones responds that despite assisting Duncan in dethroning the old marquis, the bandit leader has failed to deliver on promises made to him and his associates.
{cps=50}Therefore, many of Duncan's men, who had joined him solely for the chance to get rich, are now unhappy with the terms of employment.

{cps=50}About Hoggard...
{cps=50}You sure took your time, lad.
{cps=50}Old Hoggard kicked the bucket during the final assault on the city. Got an arrow through the visor of his helmet.{vspace=5}May he rest in peace.
{cps=50}So unless it was you who shot that arrow, the problem has solved itself.
{cps=50}And no one has got to bear the sin.
{cps=50}The meeting with the Parisian bandits, however, doesn't go as expected...
{cps=50}Somehow, they appear to be well informed of your adventures in Rouen and aware of how you first gained the trust of a local gang leader and then ratted him out to the city guards.
{cps=50}In this regard, the Parisian bandits proclaim that you now owe a debt to the underworld - and there are two ways to repay it.
{cps=50}Thus, you must either pay out a solid amount of money or carry out a certain job for the bandits.
{cps=50}Failure to do so, they promise, would result in a severe punishment.
{cps=50}Having received the desired sum, the bandits state that now they have no quarrel with you and are willing to do business.
{cps=50}The bandits agree to give you a couple of days, but also advise you not to test their patience.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [in_bandits_debt.name!ti].
{cps=50}They task you with eliminating the leader of a rival gang, Raoul of Aragon, who is holed up in his alchemical laboratory outside of the city.
{cps=50}The Parisian bandits have long had a score to settle with him, but no one was in a hurry to mess with Raoul - a great expert in poisons and toxins - for obvious reasons.
{cps=50}But now, with you here, this problem can be addressed.
{cps=50}Realizing that the task is not easy, the bandits agree to give you a couple of days to prepare, but also advise you not to test their patience.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [in_bandits_debt.name!ti].

{cps=50}Since the royal troops arrived in York, the burgomaster's residence was the earl's temporary headquarters. And after the 'accidental and tragic' death of the head of the city, The earl and his people have settled there as a full-fledged masters.
{cps=50}Now wealthy merchants and the nobility of York, who through the burgomaster tried to force the royal emissaries to  reckon with their petty interests and greedy ambitions, are left out in the cold.
{cps=50}And you got to see for yourself yet another testimony to their shaky position in town.
{cps=50}Arriving at the residence to report back on outcome of the prisoner's interrogation, you found several rich nobles in the guest room, waiting for the earl's audience. Pretentious and snobbish, in fur-lined brocade robes and with golden chains squeezing their fat necks, they almost burst from rage when the earl's adjutant seated you at the same table with them.
{cps=50}The fact that they were not only forced to wait, but also forced to do so in the company of a rootless peasant like you, literally brought them to white heat.
{cps=50}However, the real blow to their ego happened after another quarter of an hour, when the adjutant finally reappeared and announced that the earl is ready to receive... you.
{cps=50}Throwing a farewell glance at the nobles and unintentionally making eye contact with one of them, you thanked God that you were wearing chain mail. Because otherwise, this look would pierce you like a knife through butter.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Abiding to the rules of courtesy, you hurriedly drop to one knee to show your respect to the earl.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}earl points at the door behind your back.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As soon as the trebuchet is mentioned, the earl immediately changes his expression and darkens
{cps=50}Taking a few comrades with you, you set off in search of the smugglers' hideout.
{cps=50}{cps=50}As no one else knows the road to it, you can only rely on your memory and navigational skills.
{cps=50}First of all, you try to recall which direction the prisoner sent you...
{cps=50}You decide to head north.
{cps=50}Fortunately, after about an hour and a half of walking, you realized that you had to go northeast.
{cps=50}You immediately change the course, however the energy you've alresdy spent makes itself felt .{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue increased by 30!

{cps=50}After some thought, you head northeast. It looks like  your memory does not dissipate you and you are moving seemingly in the right direction.
{cps=50}You decide to head west.
{cps=50}Fortunately, after about an hour and a half of walking, you realized that you had to go northeast.
{cps=50}You immediately change the course, however the energy you've alresdy spent makes itself felt .{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue increased by 30!
{cps=50}You decide to head southeast.

{cps=50}You immediately change the course, however the energy you've alresdy spent makes itself felt .{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue increased by 30!
{cps=50}You decide to head south.
{cps=50}Fortunately, after about an hour and a half of walking, you realized that you had to go northeast.
{cps=50}You immediately change the course, however the energy you've alresdy spent makes itself felt .{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue increased by 30!
{cps=50}After a couple of hours of travel through a very boring and repetitive terrain, the landscape around you begins to change.
{cps=50}There is a great grove ahead with several low hills rising to the left of it, and a small lake extending to the right.
{cps=50}Smugglers take refuge in caves, that much you recall, but where exactly are these caves...
{cps=50}You head towards the grove, but only wear your squad out, finding nothing after a long and tedious search.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue increased by 30!
{cps=50}Luckily for you, during these fruitless wanderings, you remember that the prisoner directed you to the lake.
{cps=50}You head towards the hills, but only wear your squad out, finding nothing after a long and tedious search.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue increased by 30!
{cps=50}Luckily for you, during these fruitless wanderings, you remember that the prisoner directed you to the lake.
{cps=50}You lead your squad towards the lake right away and, after a little search, you find a cave within a grotto.
{cps=50}Without knowing exactly where to look and what to look for, it would never have been found so quickly.
{cps=50}You were going to observe the secret grotto at first. However, about an hour of surveillance later there is still no activity, so you make the logical decision to storm in.
{cps=50}As the first time head of a small, but still substantial squad, you find yourself forced to make an important decision of who is to go in first...
{cps=50}Despite the danger, you decide to go first.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Upon entering the grotto, you discover a narrow passage leading somewhere into the dark.
{cps=50}Confidently treading forward, you made just a couple of dozen steps towards the passage before your foot got caught on a stretched rope and you are deafened a shrill whistle...
{cps=50}However, your reflexes don't fail you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility and Coordination - success!
{cps=50}Instantly dropping to the ground, you miraculously manage to dodge a heavy crossbow bolt flying out of the darkness and it only scratches you a little.
{cps=50}You realize you need to drop down, but your reflexes fail you...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility and Coordination - fail!
{cps=50}...And a crossbow bolt flying out of the darkness hitts you right into your arm, leaving a nasty wound.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Health lowered by 10!
{cps=50}Preferring not to take any chances, you send one of your comrades ahead.
{cps=50}The decision turns out to be very far-sighted, because, just after taking a dozen of steps forward, his leg gets caught on a stretched rope...
{cps=50}And a heavy crossbow bolt with a deafening wistle flies out of the darkness right into the poor fellow's chest.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Health ([squad_candidate_container_full_name!ti]) lowered by 20!
{cps=50}Expecting more shots, you immediately drop to the ground, but everything is silent again.
{cps=50}Rising to your feet, you rush through a dark passage and burst into a large room lit by torches.
{cps=50}There is no doubt that you have come to the right place when you see the barrels and bales heaped on all sides.
{cps=50}Alerted of your arrival by the trap, the smugglers greet you with their swords unsheathed...
{cps=50}Waiting for the earl's men to come, you fing yourself again and again glancing at many barrels and bales that fill the smugglers' lair.
{cps=50}You remember well that the earl specifically told you not to touch anything...
{cps=50}The temptation is great, however.
{cps=50}And the time goes by slowly.
{cps=50}And as luck would have it, you suddenly remember your poisoned comrades, who were kept in the dark about the earl's plans just like you are now...
{cps=50}Turned out they were just pawns in his game.
{cps=50}The temptation is too much for you to handle and you decide to pry open a few barrels.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Inside there is are, just as the earl has told you. And judging by its sour smell, it has gone bad.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 5!
{cps=50}Nothing much happened, yet you still feel a nasty sting of conscience.
{cps=50}Perhaps Ruffin is right and someone like you really should think less, and leave this job for far more qualified people...
{cps=50}Having placed the lids back on the barrels, you head towards the exit of the cave to wait for the earl's men outside, and on your way out you accidentaly tip over one of the bales.
{cps=50}It wasn't sealed tightly so all of its contents spill onto the floor with loud metalic clinking.
{cps=50}Silver tableware, jewelry with precious stones and elegant candlesticks roll to your feet.
{cps=50}Out of pure curiosity you decide to open a couple more bales and find silk fabrics, brocade and different furs.
{cps=50}Someone obviously decided not to tell you everything that is going on here.
{cps=50}Nevertheless, you have no problems maintaining your composure and continue to rigorously follow the earl's orders.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}You didn't have to wait long - your comrade comes back before dawn, accompanied by half a dozen thuggish fellows, dressed and armed to match, if not knights, then definitely their squires.
{cps=50}Next to your squad of raggedy lads, these guys look like that neither is elite.
{cps=50}Watching how they, jingling their armor and rattling their scabbards, inspect the smugglers' loot in such a businesslike way, you wonder why the earl didn't send them to deal with the smugglers...{vspace=5}Or at least did not sent one of them with you to help.
{cps=50}Once the inspection is complete, the one in charge calls you over and, with the words 'Gratitude from the earl', tosses you a small pouch full of coins.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}100 florins received!{vspace=5}Reputation (earl) improved by 10!
{cps=50}You gently try to ask him a few questions, but he rudely cuts you off, stating that your job here is done and now you can scram willingly otherwise he will help you to do it.
{cps=50}Upon coming back to the city, you seek an audience with the earl, however, this time, you cannot proceed beyond the guards at the residence's entrance. They are simply not letting you through.
{cps=50}—earl sends for someone he wishes to speak to and you're not that someone, - the guards say, suggesting you, once again this day, get out.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item received - Chest!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ruffin's unexpected gesture leaves you with mixed feelings, making you look like a beggar in your own eyes.{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 5.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}50 florins lost.{vspace=5}Chest received.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You don't have enough money!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Looking at Ruffin's happy face, you decide not ruin his mood.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}If only he knew how bad things really are.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item submited - [antidote2.name!ti].

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [scrub.name!ti]
{cps=50}You take too long to return the money for the chest to Ruffin and your reluctance to repay a debt causes unflattering rumors to spread among the soldiers.
{cps=50}Ruffin himself clearly does not care to much for the money and, it seems like, had long forgotten about the debt. However, your other comrades have not forgotten, and now throw condemning look your way every now and then.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 20!{vspace=5}Virtue decreased by 10!

{cps=50}Peeking into Freya's tavern one afternoon, you find inside a small but extremely noisy company of soldiers and militiamen celebrating a successful raid against a Scottish outpost.
{cps=50}You know many of them personally and they cordially invite you to join their feast.
{cps=50}While you're contemplating whether or not to agree, Freya calls you.
{cps=50}She worriedly informs you that this gang has been sitting here for a couple of hours already, and the amount of furniture and dishes they have damaged is starting to approach dangerous values.
{cps=50}Furthermore, the brave royal soldiers stirred a drunken brawl with other customers, several of whom were beaten up quite badly.
{cps=50}Freya asks you to calm them down or, if possible, throw them out the door altogether.
{cps=50}You rudely order the soldiers to get out.
{cps=50}This infuriates soldiers who have already were quite inebriated, and they immediately pounce on you with the whole crowd.
{cps=50}A completely chaotic fight breaks out and rolls through the tavern sucking absolutely everyone in - you, drunk soldiers, Freya, other customers and tavern workers...
{cps=50}Growing like a snowball, the fight gradually moves outside; little by little, random passers-by and city guards join in.
{cps=50}At a certain point, you notice Ruffin who is swinging fists side by side with you, and the sergeant's booming voice is heard somewhere in the background.
{cps=50}After a good hour and a half, the great shambles (already quite comparable in scale to the battle under the walls of York) is finally over.  Drunken bullies, as well as all sorts of evil forces that joined their side along the way, are defeated.
{cps=50}Whereas you, Freya, Ruffin, the sergeant and other good guys are celebrating a strong-willed victory.{w} And in your case counting your broken ribs as well.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality decreased by 2!{vspace=5}Fatigue increased!
{cps=50}As soon as the situation calms down, one those who fought on your side suggests you go to nearby tavern and properly celebrate this victory.
{cps=50}Foreseeing how this all could end, Freya grabs your arm and hurriedly drags you back inside the tavern.{w} The door behind you is immediately bolted.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Freya starts to take care of your wounds.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell Freya the truth about your past.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Impressed by the story, she listens with bated breath.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The theme of your talk gradually turns from your past to Freya's childhood. Exchanging stories from life, you do not notice how time flies.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You leave the tavern well after midnight, feeling like you've known Freya your whole life.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) improved by 5!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You are lying to Freya about your past, telling a made up story.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The lie, however, turns out to be very believable and, impressed by the story, Freya listens with bated breath.

{cps=50}You refuse Freya's request, arguing that the guys have just recently risked their lives and now just relieve stress.
{cps=50}Freya, who was already on the verge of burstIng with anger, is enraged by your answer and, turning into a real fury, she herself throws the soldiers out.
{cps=50}Then kicks you out the door too.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) lowered by 30!

{cps=50}Freya tolerates this behavior for a while, but very soon she reaches the boiling point. Turning into a real fury, she herself throws the soldiers out.
{cps=50}Then kicks you out the door too.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) lowered by 80!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You agree.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Freya takes you to a picturesque place by the lake, not far from the city.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And for the next few hours you forget about the war.

{cps=50}Ale is poured by the river and you are having a great time. When your mugs are empty again, it's your turn to go fill them up.
{cps=50}You head towards the tavern owner for another go, but, instead of him, you find a young girl at the counter.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}For a moment you completely forgot what it was that you wanted to say, but quickly came to your senses.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The price the girl tells you is three times the price you were served ale for a couple of hours ago.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She raises her eyebrows.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [courier.name!ti].
{cps=50}Despite having a fairly detailed map, finding the smugglers' hideout turned out to be not an easy task. Your search eventually leads you to a small fortified camp on the river, located in a secluded area west of York.
{cps=50}As soon as you approach the camp, a crossbow bolt is shot into the ground right at your feet, and literally out of nowhere, several well-armed men appear, politely wondering about what the hell are you doing here.
{cps=50}After listening to your story that you are here on behalf of Freya, they take you to the camp, to their superior. He, in turn, confirms that the agreement between him and Freya has really took place and he has recieved the money for two loads of goods.
{cps=50}However, he says, things have changed and so has the cost. And now, if Freya expects to get something, then she'll have to  pay extra 35 florins on top.
{cps=50}You agree to pay.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}35 florins lost.
{cps=50}The smugglers hand over the goods and let you go.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money.

{cps=50}The smugglers hand over the goods and let you go.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money.
{cps=50}Hearing that you are ready to pay, but don't have the necessary amount on you, the smugglers agree to grant you a delay...
{cps=50}However, they warn that next time you come the goods the price will be increased by 10 florins.
{cps=50}The second time, this excuse doesn't work on smugglers and they decide to take what you have with you.
{cps=50}After beating you up to a pulp, they empty your pockets...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[player_gold] florins lost!{vspace=5}Vitality lowered by 1!
{cps=50}...and you survive only by a miracle.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Luck - success!
{cps=50}Trying to look and speak as confidently as possible, you tell him that changing the terms of an already concluded contract like this is considered dishonorable even by the standards of bandits.
{cps=50}The amount has been agreed on and already paid, and therefore they have no right to demand anything.
{cps=50}The smugglers hand over the goods and let you go.
{cps=50}Thanks to your strength and dexterity, you defeat the smugglers leader in a fight.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength,Agility - success!
{cps=50}However, his men, having heard the noise, immediately come to his aid, and with their weapons ready. There are a lot of them and you have no way you will be able to defeat them, and therefore you have to flee.
{cps=50}However, your strength fails you, and the smugglers gain the upper hand in the ensuing fight.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength, Agility - failure!
{cps=50}After beating you up to a pulp, they empty your pockets...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[player_gold] florins lost!{vspace=5}Vitality lowered by 1!
{cps=50}...and you survive only by a miracle.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Luck - success!
{cps=50}You waited too long, and the smugglers have changed the location of their hideout.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You find Freya all on pins and needles, worried out of her mind.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}For a few moments, Freya's confusion and anxiety vanish, giving way to ostentatious annoyance.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Freya becomes serious again.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Freya silently nods.
{cps=50}You didn't keep your promise to Freya to go looking for Maria.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) lowered by 50!
{cps=50}You find the village easily, but not because of Freya's directions. The place is given away by a large plume of smoke visible above the forests from a couple of leagues away.
{cps=50}When you get closer your worst fears are instantly confirmed — the village is engulfed in flames with every single house on fire.
{cps=50}And it almost looks like your search for Maria is over before it even had a chance to begin.
{cps=50}It almost looks like it.
{cps=50}Ready to tuen back, you suddenly notice a few strange figures moving away from the burning village towards the forest.
{cps=50}You head towards them. Seeing your approach, they stop, turning around in a semicircle to face you.
{cps=50}With each step you take towards them an uneasy feeling gradually creeps up. Its anxious itch slowly consuming your whole body.
{cps=50}After getting closer, you are able to better distinguish mysterious figures against dark and foggy forest. Four of them are standing upright, while the fifth one is kneeling. As if he was held captive.
{cps=50}Or she was.
{cps=50}The gathering twilight makes it hard to see any details. Shrouded in dark, the figures look like ink blots as if entirely composed of shapeless blackness.
{cps=50}When the sudden flicker of the fire briefly disperses the darkness, you manage to get a glimpse of who is standing before you.
{cps=50}The four are dressed in strange tatters, combining random elements of worn out armor with dirty rags.
{cps=50}The rough, expressionless faces are covered with reddish-brown stains, either from dirt or blood.
{cps=50}When the next flash of fire — the biggest one yet — illuminates the strangers again, you manage to make out the two figures in the center.
{cps=50}The face of one of them, kneeling, is streaming with tears and frozen in mute terror.
{cps=50}And the face of the other one — standing above her — is the most hideous and disturbing thing you've ever seen in your life.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You are trying to call out to her. The girl's eyes, wide with horror, stare straight at you, unseeing.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Her lips are moving, but no words can be heard.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The masked figure is saying something, but you can hardly make out the words.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As you try to decide what you should do next, out of the corner of your eye you notice that the other two figures are slowly flanking you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You draw your weapon.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Mask's grin widens.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Realizing that if you hesitate any further you will end up in Maria's shoes, you decide to set your priorities right and, before strangers can surround you, run for your life.{vspace=5} {color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 25!
{cps=50}Struck by an enemy blow, Bartholomew slowly sinks to the ground. One glance at him is enough for you to immediately understand that the lad won't survive.
{cps=50}Leaning towards your dying friend, you hear his last request -  he asks you to find his mother and sister at home in England and tell them how he died.
{cps=50}Getting you to promise, Bartholomew dies
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [bad_news_travel_slowly.name]!
{cps=50}Intimidated by your ferocity, enemies seemingly start having second thoughts about their decision to mess with you.
{cps=50}Having dealt with the enemies, you get the opportunity to search their bodies.
{cps=50}Letting them flee into the woods almost certainly means losing Maria's trace forever.
{cps=50}You prefer not to even think about what this will mean for the poor girl.
{cps=50}You don't have any choice but to run after them.
{cps=50}You were not able to catch up with the kidnappers before they entered the forest, so the chase continues there.
{cps=50}Meantime the evening darkness finally fully covers the land, limiting your vision.
{cps=50}Rushing forward through the forest, not knowing the steps, you haven't notice that sharp branches scratched your face and hands.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Light bloodloss!
{cps=50}By not taking your eyes off their dark figures flickering ahead you manage to keep fleeing strangers in sight. However, this kind of tunnel vision causes you to stumble on a tree root and fall.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Leg broken!
{cps=50}Having lost track of the kidnappers, you, limping, continue forward blindly and, after a couple of minutes, you end up on the shore of a full-flowing forest river in which the bastards are already lowering a small boat.
{cps=50}Noticing that you have caught up to them, one of the kidnappers charges at you.
{cps=50}You were about to rush after them, but the strength left your body and the only thing left is to helplessly stare after them, promising yourself that one day you will meet again.
{cps=50}Now you might just as well forget about finding Maria. The only little solace you have is that you really did try to save her.
{cps=50}When you come back, you tell Freya about the results of your search efforts. She thanks you for your courage and, apologizing, hurriedly leaves, barely holding back her tears.
{cps=50}Struck by an enemy blow, Bartholomew slowly sinks to the ground. One glance at him is enough for you to immediately understand that the lad won't survive.
{cps=50}Leaning towards your dying friend, you hear his last request -  he asks you to find his mother and sister at home in England and tell them how he died.
{cps=50}Getting you to promise, Bartholomew dies
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [bad_news_travel_slowly.name]!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}When you finally finish off the enemy and look at the river, the boat is already a few meters away from the shore.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Holding the girl by the hair and putting a knife to her throat, the last kidnapper stares straight at you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}His face is almost completely covered by the mask, but you can swear he is laughing at you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The girl can hardly move her lips. You can't hear her, but everything is already clear without words.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Knowing that the decision you make now, will be the one you will have to live the rest of your life with, you rush into the water after them.
{cps=50}Multiple wounds are bleeding. Armor is pulling you down. But the boat can still be reached if you hurry.
{cps=50}The current of a deceptively calm river turns out to be very strong, and the bottom quickly disappears from under your feet. And just in a few more moments, you are helplessly floundering, struggling against a powerful stream of water that takes you further and further from the shore.
{cps=50}You no longer understand where the boat is, where the masked figure is, and where the poor Maria is.
{cps=50}Water fills your lungs and you go under.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}......{w}{vspace=5}...
{cps=50}Waking up is extremly painful. Bright sunlight dazzles your inflamed by the water eyes. Each inhalation and exhalation is given by pain piercing through the whole body, making you shake from coughing up mixture of water and blood.
{cps=50}Slowly coming to your senses, you realize that, most likely you were saved by the current that carried your body to the shore.
{cps=50}After looking around and orienting yourself, you move towards the city, trying not to think about what happened.
{cps=50}It's hardly your fault. Hardly anyone can accuse you of not having done enough.
{cps=50}But it won't bring Maria back.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Upon your return, you told Freya about the results of your search efforts, having mentioned the burned village, but kept silent about the mysterious figures and the girl who most likely was Maria.
{cps=50}She thanks you for your courage and, apologizing, hurriedly leaves, barely holding back her tears.
{cps=50}Only ashes are left from the village by the time you are done.
{cps=50}However eager you are to continue the search for Maria, there is sadly no way to do so, as the only two people who maybe could have had any information on her fate and whereabouts, now lay on the ground in pools of their own blood.
{cps=50}When you come back, you tell Freya about the results of your search efforts. She thanks you for your courage and, apologizing, hurriedly leaves, barely holding back her tears.
{cps=50}Strangers, fighting with brutal savagery, turned out to be too much for you to handle and you decide to retreat in order to save your life.
{cps=50}Now you might just as well forget about finding Maria. The only little solace you have is that you really did try to save her.
{cps=50}When you come back, you tell Freya about the results of your search efforts. She thanks you for your courage and, apologizing, hurriedly leaves, barely holding back her tears.
{cps=50}Stranger, fighting with brutal savagery, turned out to be too much for you to handle and you decide to retreat in order to save your life.
{cps=50}Now you might just as well forget about finding Maria. The only little solace you have is that you really did try to save her.
{cps=50}When you come back, you tell Freya about the results of your search efforts. She thanks you for your courage and, apologizing, hurriedly leaves, barely holding back her tears.
{cps=50}You are not being pursued, allowing you to safely fall back.
{cps=50}When you finally find the courage to look back, there is no one behind you.
{cps=50}Upon your return, you told Freya about the results of your search efforts, having mentioned the burned village, but kept silent about the mysterious figures and the girl who most likely was Maria.
{cps=50}She thanks you for your courage and, apologizing, hurriedly leaves, barely holding back her tears.
{cps=50}Following Freya's directions, you arrive at the western wall and make your way to its outer side.
{cps=50}There, after looking around for a bit, you notice a man in a hooded cape near the thick bushes.
{cps=50}Coming closer, you tell him that Freya sent you and show him the coin.
{cps=50}The stranger looks at the coin, nods approvingly...{w} and takes off his cape, revealing a chain mail under it.
{cps=50}{i}—[name]! In the name of the King, I command you to lay down your arms and not resist arrest.
{cps=50}{i}—You are being charged with murder, escape from custody, absconding, deceit, and impersonation.
{cps=50}Meanwhile, a couple of armed men emerge from the nearest bushes behind you, blocking your way back.
{cps=50}{i}—Think fast, mate! We are ordered to take scum like you, either alive or dead - so if you think that someone will mess around with you, then you are very...
{cps=50}{i}—Mistaken!{vspace=5}{/i}He yells the last word as he strikes you.
{cps=50}After both of his sidekicks are dead, the stranger who told you to better surrender, immediately loses his confidence.
{cps=50}Dropping his weapon, he please not to kill him and promises not to go after you again.
{cps=50}The battle adrenaline gradually fades away, clearing your head and giving way to a nasty and sick feeling, that slowly but surely fills you from the inside, hurting worse than the sharpest steel ever could.
{cps=50}The only question that really matters to you, froze on your lips; you are trying to find the strength to ask it, but you are not able to.
{cps=50}Your mind offers you dozens of probable scenarios. Dozens of possible explanations for everything that happened, which would justify her. Which would prove, once and for all, that she was not involved in what happened. That it's not her fault.
{cps=50}That it is all a coincidence.
{cps=50}They might have tracked you down. Could have bribed one of your comrades. After all, they might just got lucky.
{cps=50}Theories quickly replace one another, the arguments become more and more logical and convincing and you are almost ready to believe yourself.
{cps=50}If it wasn't for the damn coin in your pocket.
{cps=50}The unarmed stranger is now standing on his knees before you, waiting for his fate.
{cps=50}You want to ask him the only question that is on your mind right now, but you just cannot bear to do so.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}{i}—Was it her?
{cps=50}Three words. That's all you are able to muster out.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}......{vspace=5}{w}...
{cps=50}Of course it wasn't her. What a nonsense!? She would never...{vspace=5}{i}—Yes. The tavern whore ratted you out.
{cps=50}{i}—She has turned in a few escaped convicts that were hanging around in her tavern. You are one of them.
{cps=50}{i}—She asked for double the price for you, and even...
{cps=50}He continues to speak, but you can't hear him anymore.
{cps=50}Love hurts.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}There has got to be some kind of ancient life wisdom, that would justify what has happened, right?
{cps=50}A valuable lesson to learn that is worth going through all that for.
{cps=50}I just have to figure out what it is.
{cps=50}What is it...
{cps=50}It's getting a little harder to breathe.
{cps=50}The stranger's voice pulls you out of your own thoughts.
{cps=50}{i}—Don't kill me, all right?
{cps=50}You slit his throat.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 25!
{cps=50}You wouldn't be able to trust his promises, even if you wanted.
{cps=50}Who knows - maybe he really would have kept his word... But in the big picture, it doesn't change much.
{cps=50}You let him go.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}Hurrying away, the stranger swears that he will not go after you again, but you hardly believe him.
{cps=50}Who knows - maybe he really will keep his word... But in the big picture, it doesn't change much.
{cps=50}If the bounty hunters and the sheriff's men found you here, in the north, then apparently someone is willing to pay very good money for you to be buried in some roadside ditch.
{cps=50}The road home is now surely postponed indefinitely.{w} Or maybe even forever.
{cps=50}Someone ventured to follow you here, to the north engulfed by the chaos of war, so in the peace and quiet of the southern lands, your capture will be a matter of days. Week at best.
{cps=50}...
cps=50}One thing can be said with certainty: now you can pretty much forget about returning home. This means that war will be your occupation, likely for a long time to come. And the army camp will be your home.
{cps=50}So you should probably take the duty more seriously now.
{cps=50}Struggling not to think about her, you wander back to your camp staggered, stumbling and seeing nothing.
{cps=50}Flopping down on the ground near the first campfire you come across, you stare blankly into the void.
{cps=50}The soldiers there are singing the song and nobody seem to notice you showing up. But one of those sitting close to you, without a word gently slips a mug of ale into your hand and pats you on the shoulder.
{cps=50}{i}Now I feel I'm growing older...
{cps=50}{i}And the songs that I have sung{vspace=5}Echo in the distance...
{cps=50}{i}Like the sound{vspace=5}Of a windmill going round...
{cps=50}{i}{b}Guess I'll always be{vspace=5}A soldier of fortune.
{cps=50}You down your mug in one gulp, and close your eyes.
{cps=50}Struck by an enemy blow, Bartholomew slowly sinks to the ground. One glance at him is enough for you to immediately understand that the lad won't survive.
{cps=50}Leaning towards your dying friend, you hear his last request -  he asks you to find his mother and sister at home in England and tell them how he died.
{cps=50}Getting you to promise, Bartholomew dies
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [bad_news_travel_slowly.name]!
{cps=50}Having dealt with the enemies, you get the opportunity to search their bodies.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Now you can learn crossbow skill from a master at a cheaper price.
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}Not noticing your presence, Vettori continues to humm some peculiar tune.
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}You can barely understand him but those few Italian words and phrases that you've managed to pick up allow you to get the gist of what he's saying. Something about summer, crossbows and men, who are not supposed to be here...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You can also pick up the side jobs at the forge. Physical labor here is quite hard and exhausting, causing, unlike other activities in the camp, a rise of your fatigue level. But such work, however, allows you to increase the craftsmanship skill, as well as to earn money. The ammount you get paid is determined by your crafting skill.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Work at the forge has been added to the list of activities available in the camp.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Repair item for [price] Florins?{vspace=5}(You have [player_gold] florins)
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Repaired!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Blacksmith cannot do a full repair of a custom-made armor.
{cps=50}Noticing how you are loitering around, one of the medics calls you over and asks if you are interested in the opportunity to earn some extra money?
{cps=50}Uninterested in the offer, you hastily decline it.
{cps=50}There is only one small 'but': it needs to be done at night  without anyone noticing. Otherwise there's going to be big trouble.
{cps=50}Seeing some confusion on your face, he promptly clarifies that the mysterious cargo is just a shipment of medical supplies from the royal stocks, that he pocketed to resale later.
{cps=50}Upon meeting with the medic at the appointed place, you are surprised to find that he is not exactly dressed for a travel.
{cps=50}You become even more suspicious when he begins to explain in detail how to get into the city through one of the hidden paths.
{cps=50}Finally, everything falls into place when he hands you a weighty bale that was waiting at his feet and wishes you luck.
{cps=50}Obviously he is not going anywhere, and only reminds you to come to him for a reward when you're done.
{cps=50}The medic finishes his briefing and quickly disappears into the darkness of the dormant camp, leaving you alone.
{cps=50}The bale is heavy, but your strength is enough to move quickly with it and not make too much noise.
{cps=50}You manage to get out of the camp unnoticed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength - success!
{cps=50}The way to the city, however, is not at all easy. Knowing that it is dangerous to move along the main path, you take detours through the muddy off-road trails.
{cps=50}The road is grueling, but you gather all your strength for the final push.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance - success!
{cps=50}Avoiding night patrols, you quickly reach an unfinished section of one of the walls, where, as the doctor said, you can enter the city unhindered, and quietly get inside.
{cps=50}When in London, you deliver the contraband to some kind of ordinary-looking house, the owner of which gives you a note for the doctor and sends you back.
{cps=50}The way back, fortunately, is uneventful.
{cps=50}Grateful for your help, the medic promises to treat you at a discount from now on, and also gives you a small reward...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}The cost of treatment has been reduced.{vspace=5}45 florins received.
{cps=50}With a couple of hundred paces left before the city walls, you're barely able to drag your feet forward.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance - fail!
{cps=50}And as a result, when several guards patrolling the surroundings notice you, you simply don’t have the strength to flee from them.
{cps=50}Lucklily for you, the guards who spot you are much more interested in pouching your cargo for themselves as arresting you and then handing over to their superiours obviously means that the cargo will have to be handed over too. Thus, they prefer to simply take your bale away and, after a couple of slaps, just tell you to get lost.
{cps=50}All there is left is to head back dejectedly, knowing for sure you won't receive any reward from the doctor.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) reduced by 5!
{cps=50}The bale turns out to be unexpectedly heavy, and after taking only a couple of dozen steps with it, you find yourself already quite tired.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength - fail!
{cps=50}You can barely move your legs with such a backbreaking load on top of you, and your clumsy attempt to stealthily get out of the camp fails instantly.
{cps=50}Lucklily for you, the guards who spot you are much more interested in pouching your cargo for themselves as arresting you and then handing over to their superiours obviously means that the cargo will have to be handed over too. Thus, they prefer to simply take your bale away and, after a couple of slaps, just tell you to get lost.
{cps=50}All there is left is to head back dejectedly, knowing for sure you won't receive any reward from the doctor.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) reduced by 5!
{cps=50}Feeling tricked, you, after some thought, decide not to give up the goods that somewhat by itself fell right into your hands.
{cps=50}The doctor violated the terms of the agreement first: the deal was that you help him with the delivery, and not to do everything for him while he is sitting in safety.
{cps=50}And therefore, since the terms of the agreement have already been violated, then nothing binds you to follow them anymore.
{cps=50}With these thoughts, you hoist the bale onto your back and go your merry way whistling a cheery tune.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue is reduced by 15.
{cps=50}After spending a couple of days in the camp, you get more and more used to the way of life here, and also begin to make acquaintances with other militiamen.
{cps=50}Answering questions about your past, and how you ended up here, you...
{cps=50}You, without any hesitation, tell the truth, embellishing it here and there with all sorts of juicy details.
{cps=50}That way the sheriff's son turns from your average lad into a six-foot buster, that before his mysterious death manages to lose to you in an honest fist fight.
{cps=50}A whole squad of knights was sent to arrest you, four of which you, armed only with a pitchfork, knocked out of their saddles.
{cps=50}And while in prison, the gorgeous daughter of one of the guards was so charmed by you, that she first helped you brighten up the lonely night and then to escape.
{cps=50}Impressed by this action-packed and, most importantly, absolutely true story, your comrades developed a newfound respect for you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 7!
{cps=50}You prefer to remain silent and, for your own safety, keep your mouth shut.
{cps=50}Your reticence and withdrawal naturally do not make you very popular among your new comrades.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) reduced by 5!
{cps=50}On one of the last days in the camp - not long before setting off - several of your comrades unexpectedly call you to talk.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) - success!
{cps=50}Upon hiding with you in a secluded place, they share their crazy idea: to rob one of the caravans with food and equipment that flock to the camp daily from all over the area.
{cps=50}Despite the seeming insanity of this idea, the whole scheme, according to the soldiers, is simple in execution and completely safe.
{cps=50}All the various carts with all sorts of supplies, once they arrive, are being put in southern uninhabited part of the camp.
{cps=50}Apparently our superiors don't expect that one of their own soldiers would get the idea to climb there, as the carts are guarded purely for appearances and getting there under the cover of night will be a completely trifling matter.
{cps=50}A completely trifling matter, according to your comrades, of course...
{cps=50}It's unclear what exactly you'll be able to snag from there, since no one knows for sure where the carts with certain things are located. But you will definetely stuff your pockets with at least something.
{cps=50}And stuffed pockets, as you know, are much better than not stuffed.
{cps=50}It is decided that you'll pull the whole scheme off that very night - in order not to miss the chance before the army sets off.
{cps=50}The night, unfortunately for you, is light, the moon is bright and everything is quiet, which immediately complicates the whole thing.
{cps=50}The security of the carts is in fact so-so, but there is also nowhere to hide in the tentless and deserted southern part of the camp.
{cps=50}You have no choice but to rely on your own agility, speed and stealth.
{cps=50}Moving quickly and hiding in the shadows, you sneak up to the carts unnoticed by the guards and, after waiting for the guards to move away, begin to ravage the carts and sacks closest to you.
{cps=50}Trying to sneak up on the wagons, you catch the eye of one of the guards, who immediately sounds the alarm.
{cps=50}It is only by miracle that you manage to carry your feet out of the southern part of the camp and hide in the maze of tents.
{cps=50}The command fails to find the guilty and you are able to avoid the punishment, however, this whole incident still leaves its mark on your relations with the soldiers...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) is lowered by 10!
{cps=50}The soldiers don't try to pressure you any further, but it's clear by the looks on theis faces that they expected a different answer.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}Grabbing the first thing that came to hand, you get the hell out of there.
{cps=50}One morning, while heading for a pottage, you become a witness to a lively argument between several soldiers.
{cps=50}A trio of Welsh archers make fun of a young crossbowman, who, judging by his speech and dress, is a foreign mercenary. Mocking him, the Welsh call the crossbow a weapon for losers who did not have the strength and wit to learn archery.
{cps=50}The foreigner, on the other hand, calls the bow 'the prehistoric weapon of the dirty louts, which is about to be completely replaced by crossbows and become completely useless.
{cps=50}The only reason, according to him, why the bow has not completely gone out of fashion in these lands is that England is on the outskirts of the world and all the trends of progressive Europe reach it with a big delay.
{cps=50}Noticing you, the disputants immediately turn to you as an unbiased party with a request to arbitrate.
{cps=50}Not wanting to support a foreigner on principle, you side with the Welsh. Moreover, you yourself have seen the masterful use of the bow many a time.
{cps=50}Your words are immediately cause approval of archers.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!
{cps=50}And the crossbowman is left rolling his eyes, stating that it's just because you don't know anything about military affairs.
{cps=50}Much to the surprise of the Welsh, you side with the crossbowman, immediately provoking their ire.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}The crossbowman, obviously very pleased with your stance on the matter, immediately declares that apparently England is not such a rat hole, since here, even among the militias, you can find such wise men.
{cps=50}Laughing after the leaving grumbling Welsh, he introduces himself to you as Vettori and tells that he is here as part of the of the Duke's of Aquitaine detachment, who also participates in the King's campaign against the Scots.
{cps=50}Leaving, he adds, that if you would ever want to learn how to shoot a crossbow or to just chat, you can find him among the duke's people in the northern part of the camp.
{cps=50}Seeing that the debate, though began peacefully enough, has already become quite heated, you realize that there is going to be a fight if things continue to escalate. So not wanting to get involved in a potential scuffle with your own comrades, you refuse to participate in the dispute.
{cps=50}And, excusing yourself by important and urgent militia affairs, you quickly leave.
{cps=50}The royal army stationed under the walls of York resembles a patchwork quilt, assembled from many different detachments of countless earls, barons and dukes.
{cps=50}A large part of the contingent is made up of mercenary squads recruited both on the islands and on the continent. Most of them prefer to keep to themselves, emphasizing at every opportunity that even knights (and even more so dirty militiamen) are no match for them.
{cps=50}All this often becomes the source of conflicts, one of which you happen to witness one evening.
{cps=50}In a small clearing, on the southern outskirts of the camp, two large groups gathered - mercenaries from the continent and English militiamen. Everyone is already on edge and you need not be clairvoyant to know that the fight is coming.
{cps=50}It is no longer possible to understand what was the argument about in the first place, and all you can do is just choose whether to get involved in the conflict at all... And, if so, on which side...
{cps=50}The choice is completely obvious and, without further thought, you rush into fist fight on the side of your fellow militiamen.
{cps=50}The decision, however, quickly turnes out to be not that far-sighted, as professional warriors - seasoned and experienced - even with their bare hands and without breaking a sweat, knock the air out of yesterday's peasants and artisans.
{cps=50}The victory and your courage greatly increase your reputation in the eyes of your comrades.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 15!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Despite being in bruises and abrasions from head to toe, you deserved the respect of your comrades for your courage.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality reduced by 1!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}The decision, however, quickly turnes out to be quite far-sighted, as professional warriors - seasoned and experienced - even with their bare hands and without breaking a sweat, knock the air out of yesterday's peasants and artisans.
{cps=50}Some of the militiamen, who have earlier fought side by side with you on the battlefield, perceive your actions as a betrayal and, after this incident, refuse to associate with you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue reduced by 5!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) reduced by 25!
{cps=50}But the choice you've made also gets you a reward. As a gratitude for your help, one of the mercenaries gives you his whip, so that 'it would be easier to fight off these scoundrels next time'.
{cps=50}This decision, however, negatively affects your relationships with comrades and your own conscience.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}Suddenly, a stranger joins your company - a sly-looking mercenary from the detachment of one of the lords. He immediately offers you and your friends an unusual bet.
{cps=50}For a bid of only 5 florins, any of you can try to beat him in speed and agility with a knife, and if you manage to be faster than him and win the bet, then your reward for will be tenfold - 50 florins.
{cps=50}But if none of you can keep up with the mercenary, then your fiver would find its forever home in his pocket.
{cps=50}Your comrades exchange glances. You can see that some of them really want to test themselves, but everyone feels a catch: it is unlikely that a stranger would make such generous offer if he was not firmly convinced of his invincibility.
{cps=50}No one is in a hurry to agree to the dare of a mercenary, and their eyes turn to you...
{cps=50}You argue that your pockets are empty, but the bid is quite small and several other soldiers immediately volunteer to lend you the money.
{cps=50}Upon assessing your chances, you decide that the game is worth the candle and accept the mercenary's challenge.
{cps=50}Pulling a dagger from his sleeve, the stranger places his hand on a large stump standing nearby, and with great speed begins to thrust the blade in empty space between his spread fingers.
{cps=50}In about a minute of his 'performance', he manages to make something like two hundred lightning-fast strikes with his dagger, none of which touches his hands.{w} After that, with a grin, he invites you to replicate this trick.
{cps=50}With a little grunt you find a comfortable position by the stump and, gradually accelerating, begin to beat out the rhythm with a dagger striking between your fingers.
{cps=50}The first 10 seconds, while the speed is still very low, everything goes more or less well.
{cps=50}But, as soon as you try to pick up the pace, things almost go south as and after one of the strikes, the dagger sticks in is dangerously close to your hand.
{cps=50}The mercenary quietly sneers as he is ready to celebrate his victory, but you do not give up and, focusing on the pace, continue.
{cps=50}And a miracle happens.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Coordination - success!
{cps=50}Matching the mercenary in speed, you manage to repeat his trick for a minute and never touch your hand with the blade.
{cps=50}The dumbfounded mercenary has no choice but to admit defeat and, having parted with a fair amount of money, bashfully walk off into the sunset.
{cps=50}But as soon as you try to pick up the pace, disaster strikes and the blade goes straight into your hand.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Coordination - fail!
{cps=50}Mockingly patting you on the shoulder, the mercenary pockets your 5 florins and hurries off into the sunset.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}5 florins lost!
{cps=50}Mockingly patting you on the shoulder, the mercenary pockets the 5 florins your comrade lent you and hurries off into the sunset, leaving you to your disappointed comrades.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 5.
{cps=50}Luckily for you, the wound is not severe, but it is very painful and for a long time after serves as a reminder of this incident.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality  -1!
{cps=50}You, however, don't want to take risk and refuse his offer.
{cps=50}Chuckling and mumbling something about the cowardice of the militiamen, the mercenary bows out, leaving you and your comrades in a bad mood.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 1.{vspace= 5}Prestige lowered by 1.
{cps=50}The streets of York are filled with paupers and beggars and one of them begs you for alms.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}1 florin lost!
{cps=50}Despite you having the means to help the poor man out, you're not so keen to give more than one florin to a beggar.
{cps=50}The poor man doesn't say anything to you, but the desperate look he has as you leave, speaks without words.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue reduced by 9.
{cps=50}One florin is not much, but it's all you have. Still you give the last coin in your pocket to the needy.

{cps=50}The dissatisfaction of the townspeople, caused primarily by the continuous shortage of food, as well as by the uncertainty of their fate, is only fueled by the addition of an army of several thousand hungry mouths under the city walls. Moreover, this army is in no hurry to set off and requires every day feeding...
{cps=50}In order to prevent potential disturbances, the earl gives the order to increase the security of the burgomaster's residence.{w} One day it is your turn to stand guard.
{cps=50}Most of the day is incredibly boring; standing in the outer ring of guards, you and your comrades chat and count the crows flying across the sky. But by evening the situation changes.
{cps=50}More and more dissatisfied citizens are gathering on the square near the residence, and when the mob grows to significantly outnumber the guard, the whole crowd begins to shove their way into the residence.
{cps=50}You and your comrades are trying to stop people, but they, determined to get in, start pushing through you ring more and more aggressively.
{cps=50}Comrades, one by one, take up the hilts of their swords. This clearly won't going to end well...
{cps=50}You are trying to calm people down.
{cps=50}The townspeople have no idea who you are, but your impressive equipment, imposing appearance and commanding tone still inspire them with some respect.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige - success!
{cps=50}Somewhat losing courage in a presence of the dashing warriors (your comrades and you that is), the crowd quickly calms down and soon begins to disperse who where.
{cps=50}Thanks to you, this almost tragic incident is resolved without unnecessary bloodshed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}You try to calm people down, but your appearance does not  command respect and they pay your words little attention.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige - fail!
{cps=50}When the mob's aggressive mood reaches its peak, several men rush at the earl's guards with clubs and knives, forcing them to draw their swords and defend themselves.{w} You have no choice but to join your comrades.
{cps=50}As soon as a few instigators drop dead, the rest quickly begin to lose their fighting fervor and the battle turns into a carnage.
{cps=50}The burgomaster's residence is defended, but a sea of spilled blood and a couple of dozen corpses of unarmed civilians leave a big stain on the reputation of everyone who was on guard that day.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}Your inappropriate failed attempt at diplomacy also doesn't earn you respect among your comrades.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Realizing that everything is about to end in a bloodbath, you are trying to reason with your comrades and convince them not to use weapons.
{cps=50}However, your authority is not enough to influence the soldiers, and your calls are drowned in a cacophony of noise.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) fail!

{cps=50}Despite the deafening noise, you still manage to shout over the main instigators of the unrest and convince your comrades not to succumb to the provocations of the townspeople.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) - success!
{cps=50}Acting quickly and well-coordinated, you wield fists and shields to silence several major troublemakers. Left without a its leaders, the crowd rapidly loses its fighting fervor, and soon begins to disperse altogether.
{cps=50}Thanks to you, this almost tragic incident is resolved without unnecessary bloodshed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}Having little understanding of how to behave in this kind of situation, you are hesitant to take any responsibility and just do what everyone else does.

{cps=50}Having wasted time, you fail to execute the sergeant's reconnaissance order.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 20!
{cps=50}Accompanied by Jones, you leave your camp located near the walls of the city and advance along the main north road towards the mountains.
{cps=50}According to the maps you studied before your departure, the north is the most likely direction for the Scots offensive, and therefore it is there that your reconnaissance mission should start from.
{cps=50}At first, Jones was quite cheerful, but as soon as it dawned on him where exactly you were heading, he became somewhat sad.
{cps=50}After clarifying with you why you are heading north, Jones gently notes that you are probably mistaken and the most promising direction for scouting is not north at all, but south.
{cps=50}Yes, the probability that the Scots will attack from there is much lower, however, there are several excellent roadside taverns there. And, as is well known, during wartime, taverns become a strategic object, which is extremely important to keep under your control.
{cps=50}Jones's arguments in favor of heading south don't end here and he reasonably notes that if you still decide to go north and look for the Scots there, then, God forbid, you might really find them...
{cps=50}And now this is a dubious prospect, really.
{cps=50}The farther you drive away from the heavy city walls and your fortified camp, and the closer the evil mountains looming on the horizon get, the more you realize that actually Jones is not as dumb as he might look.
{cps=50}After heading north for a couple more leagues in pretence, you turn south.
{cps=50}Jones immediately brightens, the gloomy sky clears, and a casual conversation strucks up by itself. A few hours later, you're already slurping beer in one of the taverns south of the city.
{cps=50}Reporting the results of your mission back to the sergeant that evening, you note that the reconnaissance was not carried out fully and you will need another two, or even three days, to thoroughly scout everything.
{cps=50}The sergeant is understanding, but, just in case, he sends another detachment to the north.{w} Which immediately disappears without a trace.
{cps=50}By the evening of the third day, the number of lost to the north scouts is already over the second dozen, and only you and Jones are still in business, alive and well.{w} You start to respect Jones a lot.
{cps=50}The sergeant is obviously not pleased with you and soon removes you from the mission all together due to the loss of trust.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) lowered by 15!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 5!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Frequent visits to taverns affect your fitness.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance lowered by 1!
{cps=50}You feel that Jones is not that dumb, to be honest, and offers very sensible things. But an order is an order... And you continue north.
{cps=50}You head towards one of the highest hills, from which the entire region is perfectly visible, expecting to use it as an observation post.
{cps=50}The road to get there is quite long, and after a few hours of travel, you decide to make a halt near a small pond.
{cps=50}And it is at a halt that the the Scots appear nearby. You notice them first: it's a small group of lightly armed warriors, highly likely scouts as well, sent ahead to study the area. Judging by the relaxed behavior and casual conversation that the Scots have among themselves, they certainly do not expect to meet someone here.
{cps=50}The area around is rather open and there is nowhere to hide...{w} Except perhaps for a pond overgrown with high reeds, in which Jones, as soon as he saw the Scots, immediately dives.
{cps=50}Wary of getting involved in an unequal battle, you follow the example of your cunning buddy and dive into the pond after him, looking for shelter in the reeds.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}Tall weeds indeed provide a good camouflage, but, as you know, God saves the safe, so the inventive Jones goes under the water, leaving only his nose and mouth on the surface.
{cps=50}However, this seems not good enough for him, and, again just in case, he begins to croak, hoping to pass off as a toad. First quietly.{w} But the closer the Scots come to the pond, the more desperate and intense his croacking becomes.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}......{w}{vspace=5}...
{cps=50}But luckily for you, this trick works and the Scots actually pass by. After waiting for a while to make shure they really left, you get out of the pond and rush back to the camp as fast as you can.
{cps=50}You manage to get to the camp safely, but being in wet clothes in windy weather for a long period of time takes a toll on your health.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality lowered by 1!
{cps=50}The sergeant commends you for the information you brought back, but deplores the fact that you failed to stop the Scottish scouts.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) increased by 5!{vspace=5}75 florins recieved!
{cps=50}Aware of the danger posed by enemy scouts to the success of the campaign, you fearlessly engage in a fight with them, despite their numerical superiority.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 7!
{cps=50}Seeing what is happening, Jones, who had already managed to hide in the reeds, reluctantly gets out of the pond and joins you.
{cps=50}When you return to the camp, the sergeant commends you for the information you have obtained.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) increased by 5!{vspace=5}75 florins received!
{cps=50}And also for the decimation of enemy scouts' squad.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) increased by 5!{vspace=5}25 florins received!
{cps=50}Well and Jones, for the amusement of the whole camp, immediately begins to tell the 'full version' of your adventures. After hearing only a fragment of his story, you are surprised to learn that in fact there were 20 Scots, and before encountering them, you spent half a day climbing sheer cliffs and dodging landslides.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}However, Jones's death somewhat overshadows the joy of a successfully completed mission. Although you understand that this is a war and there is nothing to blame yourself for, remorse still continues to torment you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 7!
{cps=50}Struck by an enemy blow, Bartholomew slowly sinks to the ground. One glance at him is enough for you to immediately understand that the lad won't survive.
{cps=50}Leaning towards your dying friend, you hear his last request -  he asks you to find his mother and sister at home in England and tell them how he died.
{cps=50}Getting you to promise, Bartholomew dies
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [bad_news_travel_slowly.name]!
{cps=50}The situation on the battlefield is changing. The battle might soon come to an end.
{cps=50}Having dealt with the enemies, you get the opportunity to search their bodies.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of a brief pause in fighting, you retreat. The Scots, exhausted by the battke, do not chase you, allowing to safely return to camp.
{cps=50}An unidentified disease begins to spread throughout the camp, which takes the lives of several dozen soldiers, and also damages the health of all those who remain.
{cps=50}At first, the source of the infection cannot be determined. However, after some time, it turns out that it was a few half-rotten animal corpses that someone secretly brought to the camp...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality lowered by 1!{vspace=5}Toxicity increased by 1!
{cps=50}You hear rumors that among the reinforcements arriving to York from the south, also came the sheriff of London with a detachment of his people in order to search for criminals avoiding justice in the northern lands.
{cps=50}Royal army is regularly replenished with new forces and detachments arriving from the south. For the most part, they are single knights with small groups of their men, that were lagging behind or lost along the way.
{cps=50}But sometimes very surprising characters appear. A couple of days ago, a squad of distinguished knights in red and white robes adorned with stars and crosses arrived at the camp.
{cps=50}Personally, neither the knights themselves nor their vestments looked familiar to you, but from the excitement rising around them, it became clear that they were a big deal.
{cps=50}According to Ruffin, to whom you turned with your inquiries, none other than Robert Sandford, a famous crusader and pilgrim, arrived at the camp with a detachment of his Knights Templar.
{cps=50}Unlike many other lords and noble knights, Sandford did not shy away from communicating with ordinary soldiers and militiamen. Soon after his arrival, he actively began to study the life and weapons of the soldiers, giving out orders and good tips.
{cps=50}He also made it to the part of the camp where the earl's detachment was stationed. And just on the day when you stood guard.
{cps=50}With no idea how to conduct yourself, you tried to give your face an extremely courageous, but at the same time pious and dignified expression.
{cps=50}Similar to how an innkeeper in your home village served his homemade mead.
{cps=50}Paradoxically, it worked, and after giving you a good look, the knight smirked and patted you on the shoulder in a fatherly way.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue - success!
{cps=50}Calling you a brave soldier, Sanford took a huge ornate shield from one of his Templar companions and... handed it to you.
{cps=50}As a result of the recent victory, a large number of prisoners had been captured. Most of them were good for nothing wothless yokels, but not all — a few of the men were elite professional soldiers from nobles' retinues.
{cps=50}Now these guys were actually worth a Florin or two. Those of your comrades who were somewhat savvy and, at the same time not excessively in touch with their conscience, immediately started pondering an idea of 'extracting the information' from them about various hiding places for all the loot that they must have taken on their way to York.
{cps=50}Not willing to get involved in torturing — even with a promise of a hefty reward — you prefer to stay out of it.
{cps=50}But, as it often happens, a fate decides to step in. One day you and a couple of your comrades are summoned by the sergeant who tasks you with 'having a talk' with one of the prisoners who is thought to possess some valueable information about a certain hideout.
{cps=50}You don't feel any enthusiasm about the task but, as the sergeant points out, the order came down straight from the earl — so refusing is not really an option.
{cps=50}Especially considering the fact that a job well done might shine a bright light on you in the eyes of command.
{cps=50}And, even if you decide to stick to your morales and refuse to get your hands dirty with this kind of blood, it's not like there's a shortage of volunteers as many of your comrades are ready to go pretty damn far for a chance of earning a promotion.
{cps=50}The prisoner, who the sergeant wants you to 'have a talk' with, turns out to be a young man. His clothes, albeit already torn and ditry, immediately give away the fact that their owner belongs to a higher class. The man's behaviour only emphasizes it as he's looking at you and your comrades with undisguised disgust.
{cps=50}He doesn't really look Scottish to you. Rather like somebody from the continent.{w} And he also doesn't look like the talkative type.
{cps=50}Trying to look and act as commanding and imposing as possible, you attempt to convince him to talk.
{cps=50}Telling by your appearance and demeanor that you're somebody who's calling at least some of the shots in the English army, the prisoner agrees to give up the information for a couple of favours. What he wants are improved detention conditions and a promise of being exchanged for the English prisoners at first possibility.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue improved by 5!{vspace=5}Prestige increased by 1!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) — success!{vspace=5}New quest added — [a_strange_affair.name!ti].
{cps=50}Your comrades too are not impressed with the diplomatic approach and grumpily tell you to stop the games and start getting serious.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 5!
{cps=50}Hoping that the fists might have made the prisoner a little more talkative, you lean closer to his face to ask the questions one more time.
{cps=50}But as soon as you get close enough the man immidiately spits in your face, once again bursting into laughter.{w} And what's worse — you comrades are chuckling too.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}It seems like there really is no avoiding it. With this thought in mind you finally get to the very worked that the sergeant sent you here for.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Despite his young age the prisoner shows a formidable willpower and stoically endures all the tortures that you put him through.
{cps=50}But you lack neither time nor imagination. The tortures gradually become increasingly more cruel and painful and, at a certain point, the man breaks. Begging you to stop he promises to tell everything he knows.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low virtue — success!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!

{cps=50}You understand that saying 'no' to the earl will hardly do your military career any good but keeping your moral code is way more important to you. With these thoughts in mind you refuse to torture the prisoner.
{cps=50}Whatever knowledge he might possess — he is a prisoner of war and should be treated like one.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}Your friends, however, do not find this fit of humanism very impressive — calling you a whiner and a sucker they shove you out obviously deciding to finish the job without you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 15!{vspace=5}Reputation (earl) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}However, that very evening, you see the prisoner's mutilated corpse lying in the camp's cesspool. This horrible sight faces you with a sudden realization that it very well might've been your decision that brought this fate upon the man.{w} You wanted nothing to do with his torments, but in the end it were you who threw him to the dogs. Whether you wanted it or not.
{cps=50}You've made your decision. And now you will have to live with it.
{cps=50}The victory that was won over the Scots did not end up being a decisive one, but it undoubtedly had a positive effect on the army's morale.
{cps=50}The most obvious change probably had to do with various grumblers and pessimists, who were pretty damn numerous even a week ago, but now were basically all but gone. Some of them most likely have deserted. Some have died. And the rest, who were still around, brightened up a bit.
{cps=50}Seeking to reinforce this trend of growing morale, the earl decided to thank soldiers for their bravery with the best move possible — buying for them a thousand bottles of wine.{vspace=5}Everyone was excited and a huge feast was coming up.
{cps=50}Understanding that refusing to take part in the feast would look weird, you participate and get completely wasted along with everyone else.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 5!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!
{cps=50}The alcohol surely helps with doing away stress and fatigue of the recent days, but the massive hangover pretty much confines you to bed for the next full day.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue lowered to 0.{vspace=5}Time lost: 2.
{cps=50}You don't feel like getting drunk and decide to refuse participating.
{cps=50}Your friends are obviously a little sad about your choice, but — knowing about your high moral standards — they respect this decision.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue — success!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 1!

{cps=50}Lucklily for you, the guards who spot you are much more interested in pouching your cargo for themselves as arresting you and then handing over to their superiours obviously means that the cargo will have to be handed over too. Thus, they prefer to simply take your bale away and, after a couple of slaps, just tell you to get lost.
{color=#A9A9A9}Here you can create your own custom armor and helmets through combining different defensive items.
{color=#A9A9A9}Let's learn how it's done.{vspace=5}All body armor in the game can be split into four catagories depending on its material or type.
{color=#A9A9A9}They are: leather, mail, plate or combined.{vspace=5}Combined armor (as well as heavy armor) cannot be used in crafting as it is already a result of combining several armor pieces together.
{color=#A9A9A9}All the rest can be freely combined between each other but only as long as both items are of different type.{vspace=5}Example: gambeson + chainmail, chainmail + cuirass, cuirass + leather armor.
{color=#A9A9A9}This will allow you to create your own custom combined armor that has all (or some) of the characteristics of the items used.
{color=#A9A9A9}The result is also influenced by your craftsmanship skill — the higher it is the better will be the quality of the armor that you create.
{color=#A9A9A9}When it comes to helmets there are two ways that they can be interacted with. They can either be combined with a mail coif or with additional protective elemets such as visor or face protection.
{color=#A9A9A9}Heavy and ultra heavy helmets cannot be used in crafting.

{cps=50}Despite your decisive attitude and desire to free your comrade at all costs, you still do not fully understand how exactly you are going to pull this off.
{cps=50}Well, first of all, I think I should apologize for the reception my people almost gave you.
{cps=50}However, given the intentions with which you and your friends arrived in my homeland, you should hardly be surprised at how you are greeted...
{cps=50}I am ready to swear to you that I have not killed and will not kill women, children and the unarmed, for God is my witness, I do not thirst for blood.
{cps=50}Forgive me for my harshness. I understand that you ended up so far from home and with weapons in your hands not by your own will, and I can see that you clearly are a worthy person.
{cps=50}My name is Eva de Lambert - I am the daughter of Count Guillaume de Lambert, Guardian of Flanders.
{cps=50}When the news of the arrival of the English army came, my father went to Paris to help King John form the army, and left his governor in Cambrai, under a promise that the city would not be surrendered.
{cps=50}{cps=50}Well, in his absence, I had to become the mistress and protector of the family estate and its inhabitants.

{cps=50}Very witty. I can't help but note that you are in too good a mood of mind for a man who has just been nearly shot with a crossbow, like a stinky dog.

{cps=50}Well, in his absence, I had to become the mistress and protector of the family estate and its inhabitants.
{cps=50}I hate all this endless listing of titles and the empty talk!
{cps=50}My father always said that people who talk like that cannot be trusted. Get down to business, already.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) decreased by 3!
...？
{cps=50}And this is your 'important assignment'? I thought I acted as a hostess to a high-ranking messenger in my house, not a street beggar.
{cps=50}But so be it, as a sign of my goodwill, I am ready to share the contents of the Château de Lambert wine cellars, but only on one condition.
{cps=50}I want you to promise that my family's lands and villages around Cambrai will not be plundered and nothing will happen to their inhabitants.
{cps=50}Knowing that my father is responsible for the defense of the city, I can say with confidence that you are stuck here for a long time. So, sooner or later, the English king will start sending foragers around the neighborhood...
{cps=50}Promise me that you will stand up for my people.
{cps=50}I trust you. Thanks.
{cps=50}We barely know each other, but somehow I feel like I can trust you. As if you have something... noble in you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) improved by 10!
{cps=50}Well, in that case, I will stay true to my word too. The contents of the wine cellars of the estate de Lambert are at your complete disposal.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - In Vino Veritas.
{cps=50}I dare to hope that my generosity will serve as a reminder of this conversation to you and your lord...{w} And you will not commit rash acts that could stain your hands and honor with blood.
{cps=50}I will be glad to see you as my guest again. And not necessarily on someone else's errands.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New travel destination added - De Lambert Estate.

{cps=50}I'm pained to hear that...

{cps=50}The rules of hospitality oblige me to say that I will be glad to see you as my guest again.

{cps=50}In response to their disgruntled questions as to where is the rest - you evasively blame everything on the French attack in the forest, because of which a part of the cargo was lost.
{cps=50}However, all is according to the will of God.{w}{vspace=5}As for you, you showed yourself excellently during the assault.

{cps=50}However, in addition to universal respect of the crowd, the winner gets a good amount of money as a prize and you are considering trying it out.
{cps=50}In any case, the fight with him will not be easy.
{cps=50}Heavy thoughts overwhelm you and the most painful of them all is the realization that you could have helped your friend, could have saved him... But you didn't try hard enough to do it.
{cps=50}After exchanging greetings with the earl, you follow him into one of the inner rooms of the mansion, where the Prince is already waiting for you at a massive table heaped with maps, papers, and documents.

{cps=50}The French in this situation are also quite willing to settle for the restoration of the status quo and the retreat of the English back to their homeland.
{cps=50}However, that's not the point.
{cps=50}Sending you home, the earl promises to personally convey the good news to the Prince and notes, that it may well be that with one successful shot, you have just won a campaign that has been almost lost.
{cps=50}...！？
{cps=50}Well I don't.
{cps=50}I can't... I can't let you do this.
{cps=50}I'd rather die.
{cps=50}The man you were sent to kill...
{cps=50}He is my father.
{cps=50}Your father? This cannot be, you said that your father is Guillaume de Lambert!
{cps=50}William is Guillaume in the English manner. Guillaume Godfrey de Roche, 3rd Comte de Lambert.
{cps=50}My father fought in Scotland against the English king - there, among the English, the name 'William de Roche' stuck with him.
{cps=50}Please. I beg you...
{cps=50}He's all I have...{w} And if you... If you kill him, then, I swear to God, I'll either stab you in the back with a knife or I'll kill myself.
{cps=50}Do you know what will happen if you kill him?
{cps=50}The war will only flare up with renewed vigor. My father strikes fear into the hearts of the English lords by his very presence. As long as he is alive, they will not dare to openly compete with the French army.
{cps=50}But his death will untie their hands.
{cps=50}Lord, you don't even seem to understand what you are doing...
{cps=50}Today you will slit his throat and come back as a hero. Do you know what will happen tomorrow? Your beloved king will deliver a beautiful speech that victory is now at hand and all that remains is to crush the decapitated enemy army.
{cps=50}And you and your friends will be the first to attack and the first to die, having received nothing in return for your life. And without having understood anything.
{cps=50}You are just a pawn in this game.

{cps=50}I didn't think you would have the guts to stand before me after all that your people have done in the surrounding lands.
{cps=50}It seems that despite all your stories that the war was started by kings and ordinary soldiers are not thirsty for blood at all, some of the English soldiers clearly are.
{cps=50}Conques, Barfleur, Fer-a-Cheval - the villages that my family owned for decades are now plundered and burned to the ground by bloodthirsty bandits.

{cps=50}I don't even know how to greet you - as a hero or as a villain?

{cps=50}So who should I believe?
{cps=50}...to kill unarmed peasants?

{cps=50}Perhaps I should greet you as a hero. At least this is the opinion of the population of Barfleur and Fer-a-Cheval, the only two villages around here that have escaped looting and burning.
{cps=50}In both of those places, according to the peasants, you were present with your detachment. It seems that a promise given to a lady is not just empty words for you. I will remember that.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) improved by 30!

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}It's clear that you should have started your introduction to this girl with some other 'interesting fact about self'.
{cps=50}Everyone around me is trying to assure me that I am absolutely safe here, but I can hardly believe it. And the possibility of being in the thick of some battle without a weapon scares me a little.
{cps=50}I don't even know where to start ...
{cps=50}There is no limit to my gratitude.
{cps=50}Since my childhood, my father instilled the idea that dying for your country is the highest honor in my mind. And these words became for me the truth equal to the Holy Scripture.
{cps=50}That night, lying in the tent with your sword at his throat, he was ready to do just that - to die, as his concept of honor requires. And finally find the death that he had been looking for for so many years.
{cps=50}If you had killed him, my life would have ended too. I would spend the rest of my short days trying to seek vengeance and would willingly throw myself at the sword of the first English soldier I saw.
{cps=50}But what you did...
{cps=50}You didn't just let my father live. You have proven that it is not all about killing and dying for your country.
{cps=50}You have broken this vicious and endless cycle of death, where every drop of blood spilled serves as a seal of guarantee that more and more blood will flow. And so on without an end.
{cps=50}Until no one is left alive.
{cps=50}You showed me that there is another way. And it will lead you, no, all of us, to the light.
{cps=50}Please take this. I want you to have it as a reminder of the hard choice you found the strength to make.
{cps=50}And as something to remember me by.
{cps=50}But there is something else.
{cps=50}It feels wrong for us to part just like that.
{cps=50}You again? And my guards didn't shoot you again?{vspace=5}Oh, it looks like it's time for a staff reshuffle...
{cps=50}Well, how is the siege going? I heard that another assault ended in failure again... What a shame.
{cps=50}But it's okay, I will ask my father to be gentle with you when he comes here at the head of the royal army.
{cps=50}Unless, of course, you like it rough...
{cps=50}You seem to like our local products. I heard that you had become a regular at our market.
{cps=50}I hope you were not disappointed with your purchases. And... Thank you for your generosity.
{cps=50}Thanks to you, a lot of locals were able to earn a living and make ends meet in these tough times.
{cps=50}As odd as it may seem, we would have had a much harder time without you. Please accept my gratitude.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) improved by 20!
{cps=50}Well, that's new. And what have I done to deserve such honor?
{cps=50}It is possible. After all, what kind of a hostess am I if I put guests, who came with good intentions, out the door.
{cps=50}The pleasure is all mine.
{cps=50}This is true. Many local villagers took refuge here after the arrival of the English and the subsequent foraging raids.
{cps=50}My people and I guarantee protection to all subjects of the de Lambert house and the French crown in general. Therefore, there are a lot of people who want to hide behind these walls.
{cps=50}And we also became the center of local commerce, since Cambrai was cut off from the rest of the province.
{cps=50}People need money even during the war. Well, other material needs are not going away either, of course. That means that almost everyone who needs to buy or sell something regularly drops by.
{cps=50}Take a stroll through our market square on the way back — maybe you will find something useful to buy. A couple of extra coins would surely help the locals.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [benefactor.name]!
{cps=50}I certainly will.
{cps=50}Marauders do not particularly disturb us here and we feel relatively safe so far. But who knows what will happen next...
{cps=50}My father has been fighting the English all his life. First in Scotland, then in Flanders, then somewhere else. I hardly saw him when I was a child, because he was always on military campaigns.
{cps=50}And each time he returned with new scars and wounds.
{cps=50}I was afraid of him as a child. He seemed too rude and harsh to me. I didn't know what to do when I was around him. I didn't know what to talk to him about.
{cps=50}My own affairs, problems, and worries seemed simply meaningless next to him.
{cps=50}Would it be interesting to hear about my new dress for a person who has traveled around the world, crushed armies of many thousands, and concluded treaties that decided the fate of kings and kingdoms?
{cps=50}This story could easily have come to a bad end...
{cps=50}But as I grew up, we found a common ground. Looking at him, I learned to distinguish good from evil and truth from falsehood.
{cps=50}I've learned a lot from him. Including love for my own country.
{cps=50}If the de Lambert estate had not turned into a shelter for hundreds of refugees, the concern for the life and safety of whom fell on my shoulders, then - make no mistake - I would have been defending Cambrai with a sword in my hand.
{cps=50}And I would be happy to die. For my country, for my family, and for my king.
{cps=50}And you, [name]?
{cps=50}I can see it in your eyes.
{cps=50}There is some kind of fatalism behind them. Stern and silent willingness to face anything that is brought down upon you... And then to emerge victorious from the fight with your fate.
{cps=50}Or to die.
{cps=50}Even though you are fighting under a different banner, I cannot help but respect you for this.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) improved by 10!

{cps=50}Well, things do seem to be a little different beyond the Calais. Your fear of death shouldn't surprise me, I guess.
{cps=50}Oh, what's the matter? Did I hurt your feelings?
{cps=50}If you find our little conversation unpleasant - you are free to go. I am not holding you hostage in my house...{w} Nor in my country for that matter.
{cps=50}Impressive eloquence. Especially for someone who is being sent around to fetch booze for his boss.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) improved by 5!
{cps=50}And yet I can perfectly see through your disguise.
{cps=50}A scared man. Trying to convince himself of his own convictions.
{cps=50}Is that so? Very noble of you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) improved by 10!
{cps=50}And when will you be ready to attack?
{cps=50}Well, well, well. It looks like I have guests.
{cps=50}Are you here to arrest me?
{cps=50}Olivia, then? Okay, okay.
{cps=50}Well, good personal relations are known to help with career growth - you are definitely on the right track. I like your approach.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Anna) improved by 5!
{cps=50}I'm sure Olivia is very pleased with you.
{cps=50}Yeah, sure.
{cps=50}You probably have some questions for me, don't you?
{cps=50}Oh, how rude and blunt. I like it.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Anna) improved by 5!
{cps=50}Well, you've just won, and therefore I think you deserve a reward. So I will be answering your questions.
{cps=50}My name is Anna, I am an alchemist.
{cps=50}Previously, I was in the service of the Duke de Montfort, but since he left us, I am not anymore.
{cps=50}Do you work for Onar?
{cps=50}Me? For Onar? I don’t think you can say that, not by a long shot.
{cps=50}I'm not going to lie, some of the objectives he pursues correlate with mine, and in the war between Rennes and the lords, I rather sympathize with the latter...
{cps=50}However, I do not work for Onar.
{cps=50}My main source of income, as already mentioned, is alchemy. This implies that my laboratory... Provides a specific list of services to those who are willing to pay.
{cps=50}Previously, I worked with the duke and his men, but since they were replaced by Ruffin's mercenaries, I had no choice but to start doing business with them.
{cps=50}They pay and also help me with some things. And I supply them with what they need.
{cps=50}Now that Ruffin's men are no longer here, you can take their place.
{cps=50}I'm sure we can work together.
{cps=50}Don't inspire confidence? Ha-ha-ha.
{cps=50}Well, that's funny...
{cps=50}But let me ask you, who does then? Olivia?
Oh, how lovely. So you don't mind the skulls decorating her chambers?
{cps=50}Eh, maybe she put them away. Although it is not surprising - she would scare away all of the suitors with those things...
{cps=50}Anyways, I advise you to be more careful with who you let get close to you. You never know what to expect even from the most harmless looking people.
{cps=50}As for me, you don't have to be worried. I have no ulterior motives or secret plans. I am like a dull gray spot among bright colors on your palette.
{cps=50}Oh, wait until you get to know me better. I am the mediocrity itself, swear on my soul.
{cps=50}But Olivia, on the other hand... You know what they say - beware of a silent dog and still water... and Olivia in this case.
{cps=50}Your will. Don't mind me, my words would be gone with the first gust of wind. Like I have never said anything.
{cps=50}I mean no offence, and I'm sorry if I hurt you in any way.
{cps=50}Well, I will not hold you much longer. If you ever need something alchemy related, then do not hesitate to drop in.
{cps=50}Or even if you suddenly get bored with the young duchess, then stop by for a chat too.
{cps=50}I'm sure we'll find things to talk about.
{cps=50}Not surprising. I wouldn't trust a girl decorating her room with skulls either.
{cps=50}I wonder if they're still there? But does it matter really.
{cps=50}Oh, wait until you get to know me better. I am the mediocrity itself, swear on my soul.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Anna) improved by 5!
{cps=50}I heard you've reached an agreement with the head of the guard? Don't ask how I know - I have eyes and ears everywhere. It comes with the territory.
{cps=50}I owe you a great deal of thanks.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Anna) improved by 20!
{cps=50}As for the promised reward, I wanted to pay you at first. But then I thought about it, and it seemed to me that money is too trivial. And triviality is for those arrogant townspeople.
{cps=50}So I got you something even better...
{cps=50}A lethal and highly debilitating battle poison. One of a kind, still experimental. So you will test it while you're at it.
{cps=50}Oh, hello there. We hadn’t seen each other for so long that I began to worry.
{cps=50}I'm sure you were worried too. Were you worried?
{cps=50}Recently is a very relative term. Especially for those who have to change their 'observation point' from time to time.
{cps=50}Reality blah-blah-blah... Why do you have to bring this boring stuff up all the time? 'Reality', as you call it, is nothing more than a gimmick designed to keep your mind constrained.
{cps=50}You know, it seems to me that you would benefit from dabbling into ancient philosophy. According to the greatest thinkers of the past, it is not the destination that matters, but the path.
{cps=50}Therefore it would be way better for you to be less busy with thoughts about where and why you are going, and to simply enjoy my company. Especially since it turned out to be so short-lived.
{cps=50}That way you would have something to remember in my absence.
{cps=50}Well it seems that my business in Rennes has temporarily come to an end.
{cps=50}I had high hopes for that medallion, as well as for... long-term collaboration with Ruffin and Onar's people.
{cps=50}But, as it often happens, fate has mixed all my cards. The medallion turned out to be a dummy, Onar's ambitions crumbled to dust, and Ruffin's army turned into a pumpkin.
{cps=50}And, seeing your decisiveness, I cannot help but assume that Ruffin himself will get his arse beaten.
{cps=50}I like your naivety. Eh, if we had met at another time, I would have made a great errand boy out of you.
{cps=50}As for your question, well... How can I put it, the thing is that your wonderful Olivia is far from being an angel, as you seem to think.
{cps=50}Let's just say that the reason for the conflict between the lords and the late duke has much more to do with the young duchess than it might seem from the outside.
{cps=50}It even seems to me that it would not be a great exaggeration to say that she is a full-fledged party to this conflict. Way more involved than the hapless Duke de Montfort anyway.
{cps=50}Hmm-hmm... Olivia, how do I put it, has an addictive personality. She has certain character traits that are not obvious to others, but cause serious behavior issues.
{cps=50}Why shouldn't I understand my younger sister's personality? I am not in the closest relationship with her now, but still.
{cps=50}God help me! You know I love talking to you, but I'm not ready to spend all day on this conversation.
{cps=50}So let's get straight to the point.
{cps=50}My sweet little sister is just a tiny bit passionate about the occult.
{cps=50}De Montfort, completely infatuated by her, was ready to turn a blind eye to any of her 'cute quirks'. But the duke's entourage - both the inner circle and the local lords - thought that bathing in the blood of virgins and decorating chambers with human skulls was a little bit too much.
{cps=50}But Olivia would not have been Olivia if she had not been able to turn the duke against his own lords. Whom she had already and quite conveniently helped to acquire a literal army of mercenary gangs.
{cps=50}Consequently, the duke, blinded by his fury and eagerness to defend the honor of his beloved wife, rushed into an ill-conceived frontal attack and... died. Along with most of those who had recently voiced their suspicions about Olivia.
{cps=50}And just like that, half of her problems were gone. There were of course Onar and the lords at her neck, but you came running to her rescue.
{cps=50}The city had no money to recruit a full-on militia force to replace the fallen troops, and yet there was enough money to hire mercenaries. Seems like too much of a coincidence to me...
{cps=50}And now Ruffin and Onar are pressed against the wall, and our sweet little Olivia is on top once again.
{cps=50}Did I say that you should? You are free not to believe me if you don't want to.
{cps=50}But... But everyone will be better off if this story ends.
{cps=50}I will not tell you what to do or how to do it. You will have to figure everything out without me.
{cps=50}Ha, that's right. And I am withdrawing myself in every sense - I am leaving tomorrow at dawn.
{cps=50}Yes. I really don't like those touchy-feely goodbyes, however... I would be glad to see you again before I leave.
{cps=50}Visit me some time if you have the opportunity.
{cps=50}I mean, if Olivia agrees to let you off the leash.
{cps=50}Well, it seems that our story has come to an end.
{cps=50}I am not going to lie, I would give a lot for the opportunity to meet you at a different time and under different circumstances.
{cps=50}Oh, I would have you wrapped around my finger... And you would've loved every last bit of it.
{cps=50}But, it turned out the way it turned out. And we have to be thankful to fate for it.
{cps=50}And even though we are parting now, something tells me that our paths will cross once again.
{cps=50}I think I'll find you myself. And you, most importantly, try not to turn your skull into some girl's piece of furniture.
{cps=50}You have a lot of difficulties ahead of you - Ruffin and Onar are just one step away from defeat, but they definitely won't surrender without a fight. So let me give you a little gift.
{cps=50}This dagger has served me for many years and tasted the blood of my enemies quite a few times. It hits in the right spot every time.
{cps=50}I am sure you will put it to good use.
{cps=50}Well, I guess it's time to say goodbye.
{cps=50}But before we go our separate ways, I think we have to do something else. I won't let you forget me just like that.
{cps=50}So, you are my guest again. I am glad you came, I won't lie.
{cps=50}Confused you? How lovely. And they say love potions don't work.
{cps=50}Sure, sure. Of course it's not.
{cps=50}Back to your question - I do not mind telling you more, but it would not be fair if I did it for free.
{cps=50}The mercenaries who were running my errands have their own problems since you came around, and so at least one very important task remains unfulfilled.
{cps=50}Yes, exactly. Actually, I ended up in this wilderness because of it to some extent, but forget it for now.
{cps=50}Let's make an exchange, you help me with this request, and I will tell you everything you want to know.
{cps=50}Well, that's great. It so happens that I need one specific rare item. For my experiments, of course, nothing sinful here.
{cps=50}It is a small medallion that is kept in an old forest chapel to the east.
{cps=50}Since the bandits were driven into the woods, that place now, to put it mildly, is not the safest. But, I'm sure they won't be a problem for you.
{cps=50}Bring this medallion to me and all of your questions will be answered.
{cps=50}That's right. My laboratory produces a wide range of goods of all kinds. Including those that are always useful to soldiers - medicine, antidotes, and even poisons.
{cps=50}Many consider it barbaric, but we know damn well that the end always justifies the means, doesn't it?
{cps=50}And if you are one of those who prefer to make everything on their own, then I always have useful ingredients and new recipes for you.
{cps=50}You see? It really is an all-you-can-eat buffet!
{cps=50}Moreover, I have a business opportunity for you.
You, as far as I understand, are now not the last person in Rennes and can help me to reach big players, so to speak.
{cps=50}Military orders. During the duke's time, my laboratory supplied the city guards and knights for some time. I think there is no need to explain how profitable that was.
{cps=50}But after all this confusion began, all my ties with the city were severed. Well, that is, almost all of them. All that mattered, anyway.
Help me get a deal with someone from the new leadership - for example, with the head of the guard, and you will be golden.
{cps=50}Bulk orders mean big money. And big money is an opportunity to stuff the pockets of everyone involved.
{cps=50}As one of my workers used to say - You want goodies?! Welcome to the goodie room!
{cps=50}I once caught one of the mercenaries sneaking into my storage room and drinking a self-made cocktail of ale and wine. Fella told me he was a bit of an alchemist himself.
{cps=50}His skull should still be somewhere around here...
{cps=50}Raising a family is easy. Especially if they're buried close together.
{cps=50}I honestly don't understand why folks are so scared of necromancy. It's basically just healing... Without giving up. Like ever.
{cps=50}And these are the same people who constantly praise resourcefulness and perseverance. Jesus, what a hypocrisy.
{cps=50}Nah. I can't help it if I always win.
{cps=50}I once had one of my servants accidentally fall into a huge cauldron with boiling liquid while preparing a big batch of nameless battle poison for the duke's army.
{cps=50} Eventhough unfortunate, this event actually helped me to come up with a name for the poison.
{cps=50}Deep Fried Homicide.{vspace=5}Sales numbers have been off the charts ever since.
{cps=50}But that might be due to the war... I never thought about that, to be honest. Hm-m-m...
{cps=50}Ah, whatever.
{cps=50}During your walk through the forest you, without even noticing it, wander into a deep thicket and soon realize that you are completely lost.
{cps=50}Following one of the narrow paths in the woods, you suddenly meet a wandering monk.
{cps=50}And then he leaves you to collect herbs alone.

{cps=50}I know why you are here.
{cps=50}What you came for.
{cps=50}Well, that's wonderful. It so happened that I needed one unusual thingy. For my experiments, of course, nothing unlawful.
{cps=50}I once had one of my servants accidentally fall into a huge cauldron with boiling liquid while preparing a big batch of nameless battle poison for the Duke's army.
{cps=50}You said I should be wary of bandits! There were none, but instead there...
{cps=50}So? Did you get it?
{cps=50}Slightly off, you say?
{cps=50}What a stupendous story. But to be honest, this is not the first time I hear it.
{cps=50}Paradoxically, all those I send in search of this medallion either come back to tell me they couldn't not find the chapel or do not return at all.
{cps=50}And for some reason I thought that you would rather be one of those who would not come back at all...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Anna) decreased by 20!
{cps=50}But whatever. You can go now. Drop in again sometime. Perhaps I will have easier tasks.
{cps=50}And as you can see - you are not the first one.
{cps=50}They were tested. And found unworthy.
{cps=50}Yes.{w} Tested.
{cps=50}They arrived here driven by avarice and bloodlust, seeking not to atone for their sinful natures but only to perpetuate their unremorseful ways.
{cps=50}And as you can see - I've broken them down. First their souls and then their bodies.
{cps=50}For it is the way.
{cps=50}Now it is your time.{w} Let me gaze into your soul...
{cps=50}Oh I see, I see. You're one them.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check failed!
{cps=50}Unvirtuous.{w} Murderous.{w} Greedy.{w} Bloodthirsty.
{cps=50}I know what you did.
{cps=50}I know about the homes you've pillaged. The people you've taken everything away from.
{cps=50}I know about the allies you've betrayed. Dying comrades who you turned your back on.
{cps=50}I know about the families you've destroyed. The tears you've spilled.
{cps=50}I saw the roads you've travelled and the trail of blood you left in your wake.
{cps=50}Yes. I know your kind when I see them.
{cps=50}Now you too were tested.
{cps=50}And were found unworthy.
{cps=50}It is time to die.
{cps=50}Hm-m-m. A peculiar character you are.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check indecisive!
{cps=50}Let me see...
{cps=50}You've left you friend to die in prison, haven't you?
{cps=50}You did. And yet you still abandoned him in the end.
{cps=50}Did you? Or perhaps did you not?
{cps=50}I see through your lies.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 5!
{cps=50}He was not your friend indeed.{w} But you were his.
{cps=50}You've taken innocent lives. Let your men pillage and murder.
{cps=50}Under orders, yes. A convenient shield to hide yourself behind. Isn't it?
{cps=50}Say the magic words and be absolved of your sins.
{cps=50}Is that how you think it works?
{cps=50}There might be a degree of truth to that. And yet every decision you've made was of free volition.
{cps=50}It is not all dark though.
{cps=50}You have spared people. People who undoubtedly would have been in the grave if it wasn't for you.
{cps=50}You've saved a friend.
{cps=50}How very honourable.
{cps=50}Well.
{cps=50}And I deem you worthy.
{cps=50}There indeed is blood on your hands. But there is no venom in your heart.
{cps=50}I will now bow my head to you...{w} And let you strike the first blow.
{cps=50}If you manage to kill me - then let it be so.
{cps=50}And if not...
{cps=50}Then you will have another test to pass. One of steel and strength.
{cps=50}And, alas, you were found unworthy.
{cps=50}Which means it is time to die.
{cps=50}Someone has to do the dirty work so that the minstrels would have something to write songs about.
{cps=50}Hah, remember, son: heavy means reliable.
{cps=50}What do you want to repair?
{cps=50}You did a great job in the tower, buddy.
{cps=50}I thought that we were for sure busted when this fat-ass dummy of a guard appeared out of nowhere... But you did not drop the ball on this!
{cps=50}That blow definitely made him see stars. But, you are obviously a buff guy, so there is no surprise really.
{cps=50}There are many soldiers in our camp who like to throw fists, especially when good money is at stake... So do not miss your chance and maybe go try yourself as a fighter, if you feel confident.
{cps=50}To be honest, I myself know a couple of good ol' tricks. Back home not a single visit to the tavern was complete without a good fight, I'll tell you that...
{cps=50}Oh, good times...
{cps=50}That blow definitely made him see stars. I could not even imagine there is that much strength in you - and I have an eye for such things.
{cps=50}Shiver me timbers, it's our new sergeant himself!
{cps=50}I heard you run errands for a big dog now - his majesty the Prince. Look at you go!
{cps=50}Currying favors is not the most enjoyable experience, but for us, who come from the very bottom, there are no other options really.
{cps=50}Just don't forget your good mate Bartholomew, yea, when you become a knight, a lord or an earl.
{cps=50}Ha ha ha ha!
{cps=50}Well? It was a piece of cake, just as I thought.
{cps=50}Unfortunately, I didn't quite manage to take everything from there, but I acquired a few good thingies.
{cps=50}Yeah, you're right. It would be more correct to say - obtained!
{cps=50}And as I promised, I've made it worth your while. I came by a brand new gambeson - the latest trend and just your size. Dig in!
{cps=50}Pfft...
{cps=50}I would have bitten my tongue if I were you, buddy. Because aside from this gambeson the only other things I have in store for you are a firm handshake and a thank you.
{cps=50}And if you would prefer the latter, then please. No problem.
{cps=50}What do you say?
{cps=50}You're welcome.
{cps=50}Ingredients? What are you on about?
{cps=50}For what?
{cps=50}A-ah! Damn it, took you long enough. If all thieves relied on accomplices like you - no crimes would be committed, mate.
{cps=50}Too late, basta. You blew it.
{cps=50}If I knew it would take you a week to complete such a simple task, I would have asked someone else.
{cps=50}The opportunity's long gone now...
{cps=50}Well? Got it?
{cps=50}News, you say?
{cps=50}Hmm, well I have a little business in mind for which an extra pair of hands would come in handy.
{cps=50}I have my eyes on one warehouse, where we can line our pockets with all sorts of stuff.
{cps=50}The plan is thought out to the smallest detail - everything will go off without a hitch.
{cps=50}Exactly!
{cps=50}One little nothing, really.{w} I just need to make the quartermaster take a nap for a couple of hours, and it's in the bag.
{cps=50}And this is where you come into play.
{cps=50}Of course not. No blood. You don't even need to be there - I'll do everything myself.
{cps=50}All I need from you is to help me with the right ingredients.
{cps=50}I know a good recipe for a potent sleeping aid and have got almost everything I need by now.
{cps=50}It's only a couple of plants left - there should be plenty of them in the surrounding forests. You just need to take a good look.
{cps=50}Oh yes, well, and, of course, I need a bottle of cheap booze to which I can add a sleeping aid. There should be plenty of this junk in the camp.
{cps=50}Well? Can I count on you? You will be golden if everything goes smoothly! I'm telling you!
{cps=50}You know what to do. The main thing is to act fast and seize the moment.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [accomplice.name!t]!
{cps=50}Well, where there is nothing, nothing can be had.
{cps=50}Just don't come nagging about empty pockets and a heavy soldier’s share later.
{cps=50}What can be new here... It's the same every day.
{cps=50}The same bloody siege, the same knee-deep mud, and all the same slaughterous Frenchies.
{cps=50}Great. This is exactly what I need!
{cps=50}Now it's time for me to do my part of the deal, you don't have to worry. Drop by my place in a couple of days for your share.
{cps=50}Just don't forget to bring a bag - you will need it, a-ha-ha!
{cps=50}Looking great, mate! I don't understand what you were complaining about - it sits as if it was sewn specifically for you!
{cps=50}By the way, I, completely by accident, got my hands on a large variety of items. They aren't of any use to me, though.
{cps=50}So take a look through them when you have a moment. You end up fancying something — I'll give you a good deal.

{cps=50}Who are you? And what do you need?
{cps=50}Well, you found him, and he has his hands full. Now spit it out or get lost and don't distract me from work.
{cps=50}Repair your equipment? I think you have it all mixed up, boy.
{cps=50}Do I look like your personal blacksmith?
{cps=50}Damn knights have already buried us up to our throats in their broken junk - we are all sweating our arses off! And here you come asking...
{cps=50}Damn, even if I wanted to help you, I still can't.
{cps=50}Yesterday, our bellows broke once again, and half of the work was stalled.
{cps=50}We were told we would get new ones, but they will only be here with the next wagon train - tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or even in a week.
{cps=50}Is there really nothing that can be done?
{cps=50}Well, actually there is one thing. Maybe bellows could be fixed, if you get enough leather.
{cps=50}You don't seem particularly busy to me. If you can help me with this problem, then I will take care of your equipment.
{cps=50}Oh, are you the new sergeant?
{cps=50}Didn't recognize you right away, sorry.
{cps=50}Do you have it?
{cps=50}Great. This should be enough to get the bellows in order.
{cps=50}Come back in a couple of hours and bring your stuff - we'll see if we can repair it...
{cps=50}Uhm... Brief.{w} But intense. As all good love stories should be.
{cps=50}She definitely is not forgetting me anytime soon. That's for sure.
{cps=50}Thank God.
{cps=50}Her father, on the other hand...
{cps=50}Hey, take it easy, brother! They're loaded! A couple of jewelry pieces gone missing aren't gonna bleed 'em dry!
{cps=50}I've got something for you too, by the way.
{cps=50}Are you serious?
{cps=50}You have to bloody wake up, mate. Life is not a fairy tale and it most certainly is not fair.
{cps=50}It's nice to show a little chivalry and morality here and there, but these things aren't gonna fill your pockets with gold.
{cps=50}Do you honestly think that running errands for the earl will get you somewhere?
{cps=50}No bloody way. You can't trust nobles - they will work you to the bone and then toss you aside like a broken toy.
{cps=50}No problem, brother. Just don't be surprised when it happens.
{cps=50}Remember, I warned you.
{cps=50}Oh, there he is!
{cps=50}The Capturer of Cambrai! The Vanquisher of the French!
{cps=50}Let us all bow down in honour of thine unparalleled martial prowess.
{cps=50}Relax, hero! I'm just kidding.
{cps=50}I heard you got a handsome reward from the earl... Got a couple of coins to spare for your old pal?
{cps=50}You got the stuff? I need a jacket and a chain, remember?
{cps=50}I still need a jacket, remember?
{cps=50}I still need a chain, remember?
{cps=50}Great work, mate! Thanks a lot!
{cps=50}Now just wish me luck...
{cps=50}News, huh? Actually, there is some.
{cps=50}I finally might be making some progress on the love front, if you know what I mean...
{cps=50}Very funny, mate.
{cps=50}Almost as funny as your pathetic attempts to hook up with that doctor lass.
{cps=50}Of course you might. Of course.{w} Maybe she'll even agree to go on a date with you in the future.
{cps=50}Like, y'know, the very distant future.{w} When I'll be sixty or something.
{cps=50}Well, I am trying. I am trying my best, brother.
{cps=50}Almost as funny as your pathetic attempts to hook up with that noble girl from the estate.
{cps=50}Well, there's this girl... A merchant's daughter... I wouldn't go as far as to call her spoiled, but she definitely ain't messing with no broke knaves.
{cps=50}Not if I make the right impression. I'm pretty sure that I can get her the right present to thaw the ice.
{cps=50}But that kind of drains my funds, and this is where I might use your help.
{cps=50}She won't even glance at me as long as I look like a dirty footsoldier. I need to, y'know, dress up.
{cps=50}Maybe even dress to kill, one might say.
{cps=50}Relax, brother. All I'm asking for is a nice and clean leather jacket... and some fancy chain or something.
{cps=50}Great. I'm counting on you then.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [dressed_to_kill.name!ti].
{cps=50}See? It's not so bad.
{cps=50}The girl was always going to be fine. She's rich.
{cps=50}And now - we also became a little richer. So we too are probably going to be fine.
{cps=50}The world is not fair. And if you want to live a little - you've got to hustle a lot.
{cps=50}See you around.
{cps=50}Suddenly, a whistle of bowstring is heard from somewhere behind your back and the enemy that was right in front of you is struck with an arrow to the chest.
{cps=50}It doesn't take long until the panic retreat of the Scots turns the whole battlefield into a chaotic disarray reminding you of a large city's marketplace on a holiday.
{cps=50}!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!。
{cps=50}...{w}......{w}...
{cps=50}Among the English nobles there're no real casualties... Except for the burgomaster whose bulky carcass you somehow do not spot right away. He too is convulsing on the ground clenching his throat.
{cps=50}Not bad. Not bad at all.{w} For a filthy yokel.
{cps=50}But enough games. Now let's get serious...
{cps=50}Come on. Take the sword and stand back up, you pig.
{cps=50}Isn't that what you want?
{cps=50}What happened? Can't do it?{w} Oh it happens. {w}Happens even to the best of us.
{cps=50}Have to pay some respect where it is due — when I strike men down they usually don't even try to get up.
{cps=50}So, yeah, at least you've got that going for you. If it's any consolation, of course.
{cps=50}Admittingly I never expected to see something like that from an Englishman. And definitely not from a filthy peasant.
{cps=50}Oh, wait... Let me guess — did I slay one of your yokel friends? Is this about revenge?
{cps=50}I see.{w} But there's no other way this could have gone, I'm afraid.
{cps=50}The English can muster an army of ten thousand filthy pigs like you and your friends — and we still would easily beat you. Hell, I might even slay all of you myself.
{cps=50}Do you know why? Because it's about blood. Blood is power. And nothing in this world is more powerful that pure noble blood.
{cps=50}And swines like you, born in a barn and raised in mud, in whose veins there is ale mixed with waste water — will never understand it. And this is why you will arrogantly challenge men like me again and again. And — again and again — will be slayed.
{cps=50}Slaughtered even. Like the cattle you.
{cps=50}But Lord is my witness — there is no bloodthirst in me. I believe only in retribution. In a payment for what is due.
{cps=50}When your men captured my brother I was confident that you will treat him as honorable people should. I brought over a ransom that was asked for — and what did I get in return? A mutilated corpse of a man tortured to death whose tormentors were so petty that they even tore the silver buttons off his jacket.
{cps=50}If this is how they wage war in England then I'm happy to oblige.
{cps=50}And when it comes to you, then... Then so be it. I will do what your men did not. I will give you a chance.
{cps=50}Remember what happened this day and never in your life wear a weapon again.
{cps=50}Or, if it actually is revenge that you're after, then alright. I am duke de Monfort and my family estate is in city of Rennes in Bretagne.
{cps=50}Come visit me some day.{w} And I promise that you'll die a beautiful death.{w} But if you dare to do this then do some proper training first. If I see you swinging your weapon like a hoe in a field again — I'll feed you to the dogs.

{cps=50}I see.{vspace=5}You've made your choice then.
{cps=50}During the voyage you think about your future and come to a conclusion that, despite everything you've already been through, your thirst for adventures has not yet been quenched and thus decide to go on another risky venture.
{cps=50}And no place on earth will make you happier than here.
{cps=50}Welcome to de Châtillon estate. You're here at my invitation so there's no need for me to introduce myself, I believe.
{cps=50}I already know who you are.{vspace=5}I am well informed.
{cps=50}Especially about anything that has to do with my business partners or employees — former, current, or potential.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}The same, unfortunately, cannot be said about the members of my own family.
{cps=50}But I won't be boring you with tales of my family woes — as I doubt that you have any interest in this subject.{vspace=5}{w}Instead, let's talk about you.
{cps=50}Like I said, it is in my habit to look into one's background before I invite them to my house. You're no exception.
{cps=50}And I have to say that you've got quite a resume: campaign in Flandres, siege of Cambrai, war in Bretagne, defense of Rennes...
{cps=50}And I have to say that you've got quite a resume: campaign in Flandres, siege of Cambrai, war in Bretagne...
{cps=50}All of that in just a recent couple of years.
{cps=50}My sources were unable to shed any light on your affairs in England before the war but at that point I already possessed enough information.
{cps=50}Enough to believe that you're exactly the man I require for the job...
{cps=50}...The job that might easily prove to be way too dangerous for anyone with less experience.
{cps=50}Very well.{vspace=5}{w}Let's get to the point then.
{cps=50}I need someone to go to Outremer — beyond the sea — to the lands of the Saracens.
{cps=50}Find my youngest son and then bring him back.
{cps=50}Alive.
{cps=50}Renauld. My second son.
{cps=50}God is my witness, I have no desire to turn my study into a confessionary and you — into a priest. And yet, I'm afraid, I have to.
{cps=50}I have already complained about not dedicating enough time to my family and it's Renauld's story that is a shining example of that.
{cps=50}He is my second son. In every sense of the word.{vspace=5}I always devoted what little free time I had to the eldest son - Henri, seeing him as my heir. The bearer of our surname and the successor of the family.
{cps=50}Ever since childhood Renauld has been left to his own devices. Our family never had any troubles with money so he always got what he wanted — but the boy had a horrible temper.
{cps=50}He always led a sort of bacchanalian life.{vspace=5}Fights, women, wine, gambling, blasphemous talks — Renauld fell prey to each of these vices from a young age, and the situation only worsened over the years.
{cps=50}I didn't think too much about it when looking at him back then — on those rare occasions when I did find time for my own younger son.
{cps=50}Who cares? It's just another Sunday service missed, just another bloody street fight, just another drunken brawl, just another whore in his bed.
{cps=50}A real man always wants more fights, more women, and more wine — so I thought.{vspace=5}{w}It's nothing...
{cps=50}And then one day, when my eyes finally opened, I saw the truth. I saw a horrible abomination of a human that replaced my son. Not even a human — a thing corrupted by every vice imaginable and revelling in its impunity.
{cps=50}But even then I didn't have enough of basic love for him and simple honour to put an end to all of that. Instead I preferred to turn a blind eye and just pretend that nothing was happening...
{cps=50}Until it was too late.
{cps=50}Renauld started showing interest in Aleanor — daughter of Etienne Gotti, an Italian merchant. But when she did not reciprocate his feelings, Renauld started to threaten her.
{cps=50}Aleanor's brother stood up for her.{vspace=5}{w}And Renauld killed him.
{cps=50}It could have ended even worse for the poor girl if Renauld hadn't been arrested.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}I won't bore you with further details. He was about to be executed and my family's reputation was about to be forever stained. And, I swear to God, I did not know which one of these two was scaring me the most.
{cps=50}I used my wealth and connections to pull some strings and snatch him from the executioner's block at the last minute, but for obvious reasons he could not remain here any longer. So I grabbed onto the first opportunity to get him as far away as possible.
{cps=50}Count de Molay was about to embark on a crusade in Outremer. He was reluctant when I first approached him about Renauld but he owed me a favor. And so...{vspace=5}Out of sight — out of mind.
{cps=50}I didn't care what would happen to him or what else he might do, as long as it all took place somewhere far enough to not damage my reputation.
{cps=50}This all happened a year and a half ago.{vspace=5}{w}And then Henri fell ill.
{cps=50}The disease seemed trivial at first, but as months went by Henri only got worse.{vspace=5}{w}And now the doctors tell me that his days are numbered and it would be a miracle if he lasts until Christmas.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}The Lord is punishing me.
{cps=50}The Lord blessed me with two sons, but my pride and my foolishness have first taken one away from me, and now they are taking the second one...
{cps=50}Instead of spending time with my family, I was being delusional about 'the greatness of my house' and how it would 'live in centuries'.{vspace=5}{w}And now this house of mine is crumbling like a house of cards. While all of its 'greatness' is draining away like water through fingers.
{cps=50}I beg you. Bring me back Renauld.
{cps=50}Bring me back my heir.
{cps=50}Bring me back my son.
{cps=50}The reward will be more than worth it - 25,000 florins plus a lifetime place in my court, if you desire it.
{cps=50}I will also eagerly cover all the possible expenses. Equipment, men, your journey there and back — you won't have to spend a coin out of your own pocket.
{cps=50}The expedition of Count de Molay was heading to aid the governor of Damietta in his struggle against the Mamluk Sultanate.
{cps=50}The last news that came from there suggested that the count and his men had succeeded in defending the Christian lands and now they were preparing an attack deep inside the Muslim lands.
{cps=50}But that was months ago.
{cps=50}Only the Lord knows what's happening there right now.
{cps=50}As for Renauld...{vspace=5}{w}...I know nothing about either his whereabouts or his fate.
{cps=50}The city of Damietta. Count de Molay's company.{vspace=5}This, I'm afraid, is all I can give you.
{cps=50}I don't think you require any advice, especially from me. But I'll say it anyway.
{cps=50}Prepare yourself. Outremer is as deadly as it is vast. It's a place where nature itself turns against man.
{cps=50}There, dying from the scorching heat, lack of water or an exotic disease will be just as easy as getting killed by a Saracen's curved sword or a bandit's arrow.
{cps=50}I'll give you a week to prepare. Spend it wisely.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [second_son.name!ti].
{cps=50}It is time to go, [name].
{cps=50}Your journey will not be easy, but if you can't do it — then no one can.
{cps=50}The fate of my family rests in your hands.{vspace=5}{w}May God be with you.
{cps=50}You try to come at it from a different angle and ask about Count de Molay, but luck turns away from you here too. The count and his company, according to the governor, have been on a campaign against El Mansour for almost a month now and are now many leagues away from here.
{cps=50}Once Roger falls — the fate of the battle is pretty much decided.
{cps=50}Praise the Lord, you didn't try to chase them — the last thing we wanted was to force them into a bloody last stand that would slaughter half of our men.
{cps=50}For should we not sheathe our swords and curb our ambitions — the victor of this conflict risks to be left with nothing but a scorched wasteland instead of a prosperous realm that our kingdom is today.
{cps=50}Well, definitely not you!
{cps=50}Hah! And don't call me Henry either!{w}{vspace=5}You've got no friends sitting at this table, Northampton.
{cps=50}And you, prince — don't have any true allies.
{cps=50}Mark my words, one day you might find yourself telling him the same things that we are now.
{cps=50}But, honestly, whatever.
{cps=50}We're here today to stop this bloody war and settle the fate of the kingdom.
{cps=50}Death has caught up to the king during a campaign, and the circumstances of his demise are, as it looks to me... {i}somewhat unclear.
{cps=50}Unlike all of you I did not participate in the said campaign and thus can consider myself to be an impartial party.
{cps=50}On top of that, I also happen to hold the highest title of everyone present.{vspace=5}Not counting, of course, a person of royal blood.
{cps=50}Thus, I conclude, that if a final say in this argument would be left to me — which, of course, I fully deserve — then we will be guaranteed to find a settlement that would satisfy everyone present.
{cps=50}Many lords and noblemen have lost their lives fighting under the king's banner in France — their lands and castles can be split nicely among all of you with everyone getting a fat cut.
{cps=50}Their 'legal' heirs, of course, might not be particularly happy with this, but they will have to comply with our will.
{cps=50}Like I said, there are enough rich lands and holdings to make everyone satisfied.{vspace=5}And the best part is — you won't have to fight for any of it.
{cps=50}As for the crown...{w}I too have a solution that is sure to satisfy everyone.{w}{vspace=5}But before that...
{cps=50}Let's get a couple of drinks!
{cps=50}Jerome, tell your men to bring wine already.{vspace=5}We are not in church, are we?
{cps=50}Looks like our old boy Henry is not feeling too well.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Northampton gives the duke's body a few kicks as the man gradually stops moving.
{cps=50}Seeing Ruffin decapitate his knight-bodyguard with a single swing of the blade, the baron in panic drops his sword and starts begging for mercy.
{cps=50}Maybe even more.{vspace=5}{w}And then the rest will follow.
{cps=50}If you want to sheath your sword for good and choose a peaceful life — I won't object.
{cps=50}So I advise you not to waste any more time, [name]. The sooner we get an idea of what's going on here — the more chances we'll have to actually prepare for the arrival of the Scots.
{cps=50}I don't recall the mayor inviting someone here.
{cps=50}Is that so? The king, you say?
{cps=50}I heard he died in France.{vspace=5}{w}Betrayed by his men...
{cps=50}Perhaps you are one of those betrayers?{vspace=5}{w}Perhaps I should execute you on the spot?
{cps=50}That sounds very intriguing.{vspace=5}I'd love to see you try that.
{cps=50}Come on. Give me a reason.{vspace=5}{w}Please.
{cps=50}What's going on, Arthur? Who is that?
{cps=50}A man from London. King's messenger.
{cps=50}The king? I haven't heard from him for a while.
{cps=50}Well then, let me introduce myself. My name is Milton Dale, mayor of York.{vspace=5}{w}What do we owe the pleasure of your visit to?
{cps=50}[player_full_title!ti]... Sounds impressive. But I do not see anyone with you.{vspace=5}{w}So let me ask you, [player_title!ti], — where is that force of yours?
{cps=50}A small vanguard, you say...{vspace=5}Well in that case, let me welcome you in York — the northern stronghold of the kingdom.
{cps=50}You can stay at my residence for the duration of your business here. I will arrange for you to be accommodated properly so that you can have a good rest.
{cps=50}This gentleman here is Arthur de Rosamund — my right hand.{vspace=5}I see you two got off on the wrong foot, but I'm sure you can leave it all behind and find an understanding.
{cps=50}The enemy, the invasion... I sense a lot of fear in your words. Let me assure you, [player_title!ti], that all this nonsense is nothing but rumours perpetuated by the impressionable peasants and various madmen.
{cps=50}The city and its surroundings are as safe as they might be, and I sincerely hope that during your stay here you'll see that yourself.
{cps=50}Who is everyone, [player_title!ti]? A bunch of drunkards in the city taverns? Illiterate village folks who see a devil under every bush? I suggest you stop listening to their nonsense and come spend this evening at the comfort of my house...
{cps=50}...where you actually might learn something useful about this place.{vspace=5}{w}Otherwise you can just take a ride to the northern outposts and find out for yourself that there is no danger of any kind of 'invasion'.
{cps=50}I have no shortage of ill-wishers, [player_title!ti]. So you shouldn't trust everything you hear. Especially here, in the North.
{cps=50}It is your will. Just be careful — I'm sure you won't see any Scots but running into a gang of brigands is always a possibility. So keep those eyes of yours peeled. The North is a harsh place.
{cps=50}And one more thing — in the future, if you will ever again consider visiting this place, then don't do that alone and let me or Arthur accompany you.
{cps=50}Prison is not a place for casual strolls, [player_title!ti]. There are very dangerous people here.
{cps=50}Good. Come pay me a visit after you come back.
{cps=50}And throws forward the knights...

{color=#A9A9A9}Before his death, Bartholomew asked you to find his family back in{vspace=5}England and tell them about his fate. Unfortunately he passed away{vspace=5}before he had a chance to tell you where exactly you are supposed to look{vspace=5}for them.
{color=#A9A9A9}A soldier by the name of Bartholomew offered you and several others to{vspace=5}try sneaking into one of the towers at night and stealing some equipment{vspace=5}from the guards. While Bartholomew is convinced that the whole thing{vspace=5}will go smooth, it may be wiser to properly prepare for any possible{vspace=5}outcome.
{color=#A9A9A9}One of the participants of the night heist ended up being caught by the{vspace=5}guards and now is awaiting execution in a dungeon. If you are not{vspace=5}indifferent to his fate it may be worth it to make an attempt at saving{vspace=5}him. Before doing that, however, you have to find out where exactly the{vspace=5}prisoner is being kept...
{color=#A9A9A9}Cecilia asked you to find her a sword.
{color=#A9A9A9}You promised Eva de Lambert that you will not let the English forces to{vspace=5}pillage the villages near Cambrai that belong to her family.
{color=#A9A9A9}Gather provisions from the three villages near the city.{vspace=25}The locals will hardly be pleased to see you, which means it is better{vspace=5}to come prepared.
{color=#A9A9A9}Find and kill Ruffin.
{color=#A9A9A9}Find a poison and hand it over to the Sergeant.{vspace=5}Optionally: find an Antidote and hand it over to the Sergeant.
{color=#A9A9A9}Due to the medicine shortages at the camp, Cecilia cannot guarantee to{vspace=5}save Bartholomew's life. To make sure he lives, she will require{vspace=5}you to fetch some additional medical items - Potent Medicine (x1) and{vspace=5}Antidote II (x1). Finding this stuff at the camp might prove troublesome{vspace=5}and maybe it might be wiser to look elsewhere.
{color=#A9A9A9}Cecilia asked you to find some additional medical items that she could{vspace=5}use to treat the wounded soldiers. She requires Potent Medicine (x2),{vspace=5}Antidote (x2) and Tourniquet (x2).
{color=#A9A9A9}The earl wants you to fetch him several bottles of good wine. It's{vspace=5}pretty easy to get your hands on various kinds of alcohol in the camp.{vspace=5}However, considering the earl's noble tastes and preferences, he most{vspace=5}likely will not be delighted by the idea of drinking the same booze as{vspace=5}the regular soldiers. The solution might lie in paying a visit to some{vspace=5}of the surrounding estates of the French aristocracy and 'convincing'{vspace=5}them to share the contents of their wine cellars.
{color=#A9A9A9}Bartholomew has found out that a wealthy merchant with a gambling habit{vspace=5}will be passing through the camp. He asks you to lend him some money so{vspace=5}he can play with the merchant and (hopefully) strip him of all his cash.
{color=#A9A9A9}The earl and the prince have ordered you to sneak into Cambrai under{vspace=5}the disguise of a monk and get some intelligence about the situation in{vspace=5}the city.{vspace=25}This quest will only check your trinkets - armor and weapons can be kept on.
{color=#A9A9A9}Assassinate William de Roche on the orders of the Prince.{vspace=25}Every morning de Roche takes a ride around the French positions and for{vspace=5}a brief moment ends up near the watchtower, from where he can{vspace=5}theoretically be hit with a crossbow shot. If you don't intend to do this yourself,{vspace=5}then you need to prepare a crossbow with a bolt and also find a decent{vspace=5}shooter, capable of doing the job.
{color=#A9A9A9}Assassinate William de Roche on the orders of the Prince.{vspace=25}Wounded during the previous assassination attempt, de Roche is now placed{vspace=5}under heavy security in the depths of the French camp. Using the surprise{vspace=5}night attack as a distraction, you are to sneak into the camp, find de{vspace=5}Roche and kill him.
{color=#A9A9A9}The Sergeant ordered you to deliver an important message and a shipment{vspace=5}of water to a remote outpost. The road there, in his own words, might be{vspace=5}rather perilous as the French have already attempted several raids in{vspace=5}that area.{vspace=25}Before heading there, you must pick up the water shipment from{vspace=5}the Sergeant.
{color=#A9A9A9}According to Eva, the De Lambert estate has become a shelter for many{vspace=5}refugees from the surrounding villages. The poor souls are desperately{vspace=5}trying to get some trade going so they can make their ends meet and will{vspace=5}be happy to get any money - even from the English.{vspace=25}Spend 150 Florins on various goods in De Lambert estate.
{color=#A9A9A9}Find places near Cambrai that can be looted for supplies to save the army{vspace=5}from starvation.
{color=#A9A9A9}Talk to Olivia and come up with a plan for saving the city.
{color=#A9A9A9}Go on a reconnaissance mission to the three farms around Rennes.{vspace=5}Get more information about the mercenaries and the rebels.
{color=#A9A9A9}Conduct an attack on Olivier's farm.{vspace=5}That will require convincing Dupont that he can trust you and your men{vspace=5}and also increasing Rennes' strength index up to 8.
{color=#A9A9A9}Aid De Guesclin in equipping the City's militia.
{color=#A9A9A9}Go on a walk around Rennes' countryside with Olivia.
{color=#A9A9A9}Convince Dupont to conduct business with Anna's alchemist lab.
{color=#A9A9A9}Collect the medallion from an abandoned chapel for Anna.
{color=#A9A9A9}Completely clear the surroundings of Rennes of all mercenary forces.{vspace=5}Lower the Mercenary's Forces index to 0.
Another Genius Idea
{color=#A9A9A9}According to another genius plan, concocted by the prince and the earl,{vspace=5}you must make an appearance in the court of Count Caldwell and 'impress'{vspace=5}his daughter. After using her influence over her father, you are to{vspace=5}convince the count to lend his forces to your cause and support the{vspace=5}Prince in his struggle against lord Canterbury.{vspace=25}The exact means by which you are supposed to achieve these goals are not{vspace=5}specified.
Sword of Justice
{color=#A9A9A9}Travel to the Lindisfarne abbey and recover the Sword of Justice that{vspace=5}is supposed to be kept there. Despite the fact that in the last decades{vspace=5}the abbey has become somewhat forsaken and desolate, the earl and the{vspace=5}prince tend to think that the sword will still be there.
Death and Taxes
{color=#A9A9A9}Visit the Sheriff of Greenwich under the disguise of a tax collector{vspace=5}and try to find any information linking him to the bandits.
My Little Dark Age
{color=#A9A9A9}Stop the brigands from pillaging Greenwich and its surroundings.{vspace=25}Defeat the bandits in 3 random encounters.

Crafting item
{size=-5}Crafting items cannot be equipped or consumed and have no effects.{vspace=5}However they can serve as ingredients in various crafts allowing you to create{vspace=5}all kinds of useful items.
Battle consumable item
{size=-5}Battle consumable items can only be used during battles.
Camp consumable item
{size=-5}Camp consumable items can only be used in camps between battles.
Trinket
{size=-5}Trinkets are special items that possess various effects (both buffs and debuffs){vspace=5}that can be equipped independently from any other gear.
Trinket (Expendable)
{size=-5}Expendable trinkets work the same way as regular trinkets with only one difference{vspace=5}- expendable trinkets that were equipped by the player before the battle will be{vspace=5}removed afterwards and considered expended. Good examples of expendable trinkets{vspace=5}are poisons and alcohol.
Bleeding
{size=-5}If a character has a bleeding effect applied to them - they will continue to{vspace=5}lose 3 HP every turn as long as the effect lasts. The duration of bleeding inflicted{vspace=5}by most attacks is determined randomly between 1 and 4 turns.
Bloodloss
{size=-5}Bloodloss effect triggers either after a character has suffered 3 consecutive{vspace=5}bleeding effects inflicted on them or when a character's throat has been cut{vspace=5}as a result of a successful neck strike triggering this effect. Bloodloss effect will{vspace=5}considerably increase character's fatigue gain and also will turn any bleedings{vspace=5}that are inflicted unto them into heavy bleedings which deal higher damage.

Thick padded jacket that is capable of providing some protection{vspace=5}but can hardly be considered as something serious.
Strengthened jacket made of sturdy leather. Very similar to gambeson in{vspace=5}pretty much all of the aspects. Except for the style points, of course.
Leather cuirass that only covers the body, trading limbs protection for{vspace=5}some additional mobility.
Low quality chainmail that has been in use for quite some time.{vspace=5}It might've been a prime piece of defensive gear once - but those days{vspace=5}have long passed.
High quality chainmail armor with good overall protection.
Strengthened chainmail with some additional protection that comes at the cost{vspace=5}of the increased weight.
Combined armor that consists of two layers of defense - a chainmail and{vspace=5}a padded jacket.
Heavy iron cuirass that provides very respectable protection to the{vspace=5}wearer's torso but nothing to everything else.
Upper-echelon armor set commonly worn by wealthy soldiers and{vspace=5}lords' retinue.
Combined armor set that utilizes steel plates to protect vital organs.{vspace=5}Highly popular among mercenaries who've got some cash on their hands.
Richly decorated armor set that is meant to not only provide protection but{vspace=5}to also show off its owner's social status. Which of the two is considered{vspace=5}to be the primary objective is somewhat debatable though.
High-quality plate armor favoured by knights.
Originally intended for jousting, this heavy plate armor will wrap you in{vspace=5}an impenetrable defensive shell but also will highly damage your mobility.
Flexible and rather lightweight chainmail hood that protects the{vspace=5}wearer's whole head except for the face.
Close-fitting skull cap made of durable steel or iron. Its defence{vspace=5}capabilities may be somewhat lacking in comparison with other helmets{vspace=5}but its small weight and relative affordability make it popular among{vspace=5}soldiers and lower-ranking knights.
Open-faced helmet of a particular shape that helps to deflect incoming{vspace=5}strikes. Standard helmet of choice for your average man-at-arms with{vspace=5}a couple of Florins to his name.
Sallet is an evolution of the bascinet helmet with better overall{vspace=5}characteristics and, as a result, a higher price.
Sallet is an evolution of the bascinet helmet with better overall{vspace=5}characteristics and, as a result, a higher price.{vspace=5}This one also has a bevor and a visor attached.
A version of the bascinet helmet that is popular in northern Italy and{vspace=5}southern France.
A visorless war helmet with a T-shaped opening.
A version of the bascinet helmet equipped with a visor for face{vspace=5}protection.
A version of the bascinet helmet equipped with an eventail. It does{vspace=5}leave the face unprotected, but also is much more comfortable than its{vspace=5}counterparts with visors.
The full combo. Bascinet with a visor and an aventail. It gives as much{vspace=5}protection as a standard helmet can - it doesn't really get any better{vspace=5}than that. Unless you're willing to spend some ridiculous money.
Iconic templar helmet. Does a very good job of protecting the wearer's{vspace=5}head but severely handicaps your ability to hear and see stuff{vspace=5}around you.
Jousting helmet with excellent head and neck protection. However, due{vspace=5}to its enormous weight, can hardly be used in any regular battle that{vspace=5}might last longer than a couple of minutes.
Low-quality self-made hunting bolt with a low-caliber quarrelhead.{vspace=5}The tip of the bolt is covered with poison.
A heavy crossbow bolt designed for penetrating light armor and mostly utilised{vspace=5}for military purposes.{vspace=5}The tip of the bolt is covered with poison.
A fear-inspiring bolt that is purposefully designed to inflict horrendous{vspace=5}flesh wounds and open bleedings.
A fear-inspiring bolt that is purposefully designed to inflict horrendous{vspace=5}flesh wounds and open bleedings.{vspace=5}The tip of the bolt is covered with poison.
Designed to incapacitate the enemy, this bolt severely lacks both damage{vspace=5}dealing and armor-piercing capabilities. It will however inflict considerable{vspace=5}blunt force trauma resulting in heavy stamina damage.
Designed to punch through even the heaviest armor, this bolt poses a serious{vspace=5}threat to any target on the battlefield. Its impressive armor-piercing{vspace=5}capabilities however come as a trade-off for slightly lowered damage.

{color=#A9A9A9}Before his death, Bartholomew asked you to find his family back in{vspace=5}England and tell them about his fate. Unfortunately, he passed away{vspace=5}before he had a chance to tell you where exactly you are supposed to look{vspace=5}for them.
{color=#A9A9A9}A soldier by the name of Bartholomew offered you and several others to{vspace=5}try sneaking into one of the towers at night and stealing some equipment{vspace=5}from the guards. While Bartholomew is convinced that the whole thing{vspace=5}will go smooth, it may be wiser to properly prepare for any possible{vspace=5}outcome.
{color=#A9A9A9}One of the participants of the night heist ended up being caught by the{vspace=5}guards and now is awaiting execution in a dungeon. If you are not{vspace=5}indifferent to his fate it may be worth it to make an attempt at saving{vspace=5}him. Before doing that, however, you have to find out where exactly the{vspace=5}prisoner is being kept...
{color=#A9A9A9}Cecilia asked you to find her a sword.
{color=#A9A9A9}You promised Eva de Lambert that you will not let the English forces to{vspace=5}pillage the villages near Cambrai that belong to her family.
{color=#A9A9A9}Gather provisions from the three villages near the city.{vspace=25}The locals will hardly be pleased to see you, which means it is better{vspace=5}to come prepared.
{color=#A9A9A9}Find and kill Ruffin.
{color=#A9A9A9}Find a poison and hand it over to the Sergeant.{vspace=5}Optionally: find an Antidote and hand it over to the Sergeant.
{color=#A9A9A9}Due to the medicine shortages at the camp, Cecilia cannot guarantee to{vspace=5}save Bartholomew's life. To make sure he lives, she will require{vspace=5}you to fetch some additional medical items - Potent Medicine (x1) and{vspace=5}Antidote II (x1). Finding this stuff at the camp might prove troublesome{vspace=5}and maybe it might be wiser to look elsewhere.
{color=#A9A9A9}Cecilia asked you to find some additional medical items that she could{vspace=5}use to treat the wounded soldiers. She requires Potent Medicine (x2),{vspace=5}Antidote (x2) and Tourniquet (x2).
{color=#A9A9A9}The earl wants you to fetch him several bottles of good wine. It's{vspace=5}pretty easy to get your hands on various kinds of alcohol in the camp.{vspace=5}However, considering the earl's noble tastes and preferences, he most{vspace=5}likely will not be delighted by the idea of drinking the same booze as{vspace=5}the regular soldiers. The solution might lie in paying a visit to some{vspace=5}of the surrounding estates of the French aristocracy and 'convincing'{vspace=5}them to share the contents of their wine cellars.
{color=#A9A9A9}Bartholomew has found out that a wealthy merchant with a gambling habit{vspace=5}will be passing through the camp. He asks you to lend him some money so{vspace=5}he can play with the merchant and (hopefully) strip him of all his cash.
{color=#A9A9A9}The earl and the prince have ordered you to sneak into Cambrai under{vspace=5}the disguise of a monk and get some intelligence about the situation in{vspace=5}the city.{vspace=25}This quest will only check your trinkets - armor and weapons can be kept on.
{color=#A9A9A9}Assassinate William de Roche on the orders of the Prince.{vspace=25}Every morning de Roche takes a ride around the French positions and for{vspace=5}a brief moment ends up near the watchtower, from where he can{vspace=5}theoretically be hit with a crossbow shot. If you don't intend to do this yourself,{vspace=5}then you need to prepare a crossbow with a bolt and also find a decent{vspace=5}shooter, capable of doing the job.
{color=#A9A9A9}Assassinate William de Roche on the orders of the Prince.{vspace=25}Wounded during the previous assassination attempt, de Roche is now placed{vspace=5}under heavy security in the depths of the French camp. Using the surprise{vspace=5}night attack as a distraction, you are to sneak into the camp, find de{vspace=5}Roche and kill him.
{color=#A9A9A9}The Sergeant ordered you to deliver an important message and a shipment{vspace=5}of water to a remote outpost. The road there, in his own words, might be{vspace=5}rather perilous as the French have already attempted several raids in{vspace=5}that area.{vspace=25}Before heading there, you must pick up the water shipment from{vspace=5}the Sergeant.
{color=#A9A9A9}According to Eva, the De Lambert estate has become a shelter for many{vspace=5}refugees from the surrounding villages. The poor souls are desperately{vspace=5}trying to get some trade going so they can make their ends meet and will{vspace=5}be happy to get any money - even from the English.{vspace=25}Spend 150 Florins on various goods in De Lambert estate.
{color=#A9A9A9}Find places near Cambrai that can be looted for supplies to save the army{vspace=5}from starvation.
{color=#A9A9A9}Talk to Olivia and come up with a plan for saving the city.
{color=#A9A9A9}Go on a reconnaissance mission to the three farms around Rennes.{vspace=5}Get more information about the mercenaries and the rebels.
{color=#A9A9A9}Conduct an attack on Olivier's farm.{vspace=5}That will require convincing Dupont that he can trust you and your men{vspace=5}and also increasing Rennes' strength index up to 8.
{color=#A9A9A9}Aid De Guesclin in equipping the City's militia.
{color=#A9A9A9}Go on a walk around Rennes' countryside with Olivia.
{color=#A9A9A9}Convince Dupont to conduct business with Anna's alchemist lab.
{color=#A9A9A9}Collect the medallion from an abandoned chapel for Anna.
{color=#A9A9A9}Completely clear the surroundings of Rennes of all mercenary forces.{vspace=5}Lower the Mercenary's Forces index to 0.
Another Genius Idea
{color=#A9A9A9}According to another genius plan, concocted by the prince and the earl,{vspace=5}you must make an appearance in the court of Count Caldwell and 'impress'{vspace=5}his daughter. After using her influence over her father, you are to{vspace=5}convince the count to lend his forces to your cause and support the{vspace=5}Prince in his struggle against lord Canterbury.{vspace=25}The exact means by which you are supposed to achieve these goals are not{vspace=5}specified.
Sword of Justice
{color=#A9A9A9}Travel to the Lindisfarne abbey and recover the Sword of Justice that{vspace=5}is supposed to be kept there. Despite the fact that in the last decades{vspace=5}the abbey has become somewhat forsaken and desolate, the earl and the{vspace=5}prince tend to think that the sword will still be there.

{color=#A9A9A9}Before his death, Bartholomew asked you to find his family back in{vspace=5}England and tell them about his fate. Unfortunately he passed away{vspace=5}before he had a chance to tell you where exactly you are supposed to look{vspace=5}for them.
{color=#A9A9A9}A soldier by the name of Bartholomew offered you and several others to{vspace=5}try sneaking into one of the towers at night and stealing some equipment{vspace=5}from the guards. While Bartholomew is convinced that the whole thing{vspace=5}will go smooth, it may be wiser to properly prepare for any possible{vspace=5}outcome.
{color=#A9A9A9}One of the participants of the night heist ended up being caught by the{vspace=5}guards and now is awaiting execution in a dungeon. If you are not{vspace=5}indifferent to his fate it may be worth it to make an attempt at saving{vspace=5}him. Before doing that, however, you have to find out where exactly the{vspace=5}prisoner is being kept...
{color=#A9A9A9}Cecilia asked you to find her a sword.
{color=#A9A9A9}You promised Eva de Lambert that you will not let the English forces to{vspace=5}pillage the villages near Cambrai that belong to her family.
{color=#A9A9A9}Gather provisions from the three villages near the city.{vspace=25}The locals will hardly be pleased to see you, which means it is better{vspace=5}to come prepared.
{color=#A9A9A9}Find and kill Ruffin.
{color=#A9A9A9}Find a poison and hand it over to the Sergeant.{vspace=5}Optionally: find an Antidote and hand it over to the Sergeant.
{color=#A9A9A9}Due to the medicine shortages at the camp, Cecilia cannot guarantee to{vspace=5}save Bartholomew's life. To make sure he lives, she will require{vspace=5}you to fetch some additional medical items - Potent Medicine (x1) and{vspace=5}Antidote II (x1). Finding this stuff at the camp might prove troublesome{vspace=5}and maybe it might be wiser to look elsewhere.
{color=#A9A9A9}Cecilia asked you to find some additional medical items that she could{vspace=5}use to treat the wounded soldiers. She requires Potent Medicine (x2),{vspace=5}Antidote (x2) and Tourniquet (x2).
{color=#A9A9A9}The earl wants you to fetch him several bottles of good wine. It's{vspace=5}pretty easy to get your hands on various kinds of alcohol in the camp.{vspace=5}However, considering the earl's noble tastes and preferences, he most{vspace=5}likely will not be delighted by the idea of drinking the same booze as{vspace=5}the regular soldiers. The solution might lie in paying a visit to some{vspace=5}of the surrounding estates of the French aristocracy and 'convincing'{vspace=5}them to share the contents of their wine cellars.
{color=#A9A9A9}Bartholomew has found out that a wealthy merchant with a gambling habit{vspace=5}will be passing through the camp. He asks you to lend him some money so{vspace=5}he can play with the merchant and (hopefully) strip him of all his cash.
{color=#A9A9A9}The earl and the prince have ordered you to sneak into Cambrai under{vspace=5}the disguise of a monk and get some intelligence about the situation in{vspace=5}the city.{vspace=25}This quest will only check your trinkets - armor and weapons can be kept on.
{color=#A9A9A9}Assassinate William de Roche on the orders of the Prince.{vspace=25}Every morning de Roche takes a ride around the French positions and for{vspace=5}a brief moment ends up near the watchtower, from where he can{vspace=5}theoretically be hit with a crossbow shot. If you don't intend to do this yourself,{vspace=5}then you need to prepare a crossbow with a bolt and also find a decent{vspace=5}shooter, capable of doing the job.
{color=#A9A9A9}Assassinate William de Roche on the orders of the Prince.{vspace=25}Wounded during the previous assassination attempt, de Roche is now placed{vspace=5}under heavy security in the depths of the French camp. Using the surprise{vspace=5}night attack as a distraction, you are to sneak into the camp, find de{vspace=5}Roche and kill him.
{color=#A9A9A9}The Sergeant ordered you to deliver an important message and a shipment{vspace=5}of water to a remote outpost. The road there, in his own words, might be{vspace=5}rather perilous as the French have already attempted several raids in{vspace=5}that area.{vspace=25}Before heading there, you must pick up the water shipment from{vspace=5}the Sergeant.
{color=#A9A9A9}According to Eva, the De Lambert estate has become a shelter for many{vspace=5}refugees from the surrounding villages. The poor souls are desperately{vspace=5}trying to get some trade going so they can make their ends meet and will{vspace=5}be happy to get any money - even from the English.{vspace=25}Spend 150 Florins on various goods in De Lambert estate.
{color=#A9A9A9}Find places near Cambrai that can be looted for supplies to save the army{vspace=5}from starvation.
{color=#A9A9A9}Talk to Olivia and come up with a plan for saving the city.
{color=#A9A9A9}Go on a reconnaissance mission to the three farms around Rennes.{vspace=5}Get more information about the mercenaries and the rebels.
{color=#A9A9A9}Conduct an attack on Olivier's farm.{vspace=5}That will require convincing Dupont that he can trust you and your men{vspace=5}and also increasing Rennes' strength index up to 8.
{color=#A9A9A9}Aid De Guesclin in equipping the City's militia.
{color=#A9A9A9}Go on a walk around Rennes' countryside with Olivia.
{color=#A9A9A9}Convince Dupont to conduct business with Anna's alchemist lab.
{color=#A9A9A9}Collect the medallion from an abandoned chapel for Anna.
{color=#A9A9A9}Completely clear the surroundings of Rennes of all mercenary forces.{vspace=5}Lower the Mercenary's Forces index to 0.
Another Genius Idea
{color=#A9A9A9}According to another genius plan, concocted by the prince and the earl,{vspace=5}you must make an appearance in the court of Count Caldwell and 'impress'{vspace=5}his daughter. After using her influence over her father, you are to{vspace=5}convince the count to lend his forces to your cause and support the{vspace=5}Prince in his struggle against lord Canterbury.{vspace=25}The exact means by which you are supposed to achieve these goals are not{vspace=5}specified.
Sword of Justice
{color=#A9A9A9}Travel to the Lindisfarne abbey and recover the Sword of Justice that{vspace=5}is supposed to be kept there. Despite the fact that in the last decades{vspace=5}the abbey has become somewhat forsaken and desolate, the earl and the{vspace=5}prince tend to think that the sword will still be there.
Death and Taxes
{color=#A9A9A9}Visit the Sheriff of Greenwich under the disguise of a tax collector{vspace=5}and try to find any information linking him to the bandits.
My Little Dark Age
{color=#A9A9A9}Stop the brigands from pillaging Greenwich and its surroundings.{vspace=25}Defeat the bandits in 3 random encounters.

Thick padded jacket that is capable of providing some protection{vspace=5}but can hardly be considered as something serious.
Strengthened jacket made of sturdy leather. Very similar to gambeson in{vspace=5}pretty much all of the aspects. Except for the style points, of course.
Leather cuirass that only covers the body, trading limbs protection for{vspace=5}some additional mobility.
Low quality chainmail that has been in use for quite some time.{vspace=5}It might've been a prime piece of defensive gear once - but those days{vspace=5}have long passed.
High quality chainmail armor with good overall protection.
Strengthened chainmail with some additional protection that comes at the cost{vspace=5}of the increased weight.
Combined armor that consists of two layers of defense - a chainmail and{vspace=5}a padded jacket.
Heavy iron cuirass that provides very respectable protection to the{vspace=5}wearer's torso but nothing to everything else.
Upper-echelon armor set commonly worn by wealthy soldiers and{vspace=5}lords' retinue.
Combined armor set that utilizes steel plates to protect vital organs.{vspace=5}Highly popular among mercenaries who've got some cash on their hands.
Richly decorated armor set that is meant to not only provide protection but{vspace=5}to also show off its owner's social status. Which of the two is considered{vspace=5}to be the primary objective is somewhat debatable though.
High-quality plate armor favoured by knights.
Originally intended for jousting, this heavy plate armor will wrap you in{vspace=5}an impenetrable defensive shell but also will highly damage your mobility.
Flexible and rather lightweight chainmail hood that protects the{vspace=5}wearer's whole head except for the face.
Close-fitting skull cap made of durable steel or iron. Its defence{vspace=5}capabilities may be somewhat lacking in comparison with other helmets{vspace=5}but its small weight and relative affordability make it popular among{vspace=5}soldiers and lower-ranking knights.
Open-faced helmet of a particular shape that helps to deflect incoming{vspace=5}strikes. Standard helmet of choice for your average man-at-arms with{vspace=5}a couple of Florins to his name.
Sallet is an evolution of the bascinet helmet with better overall{vspace=5}characteristics and, as a result, a higher price.
Sallet is an evolution of the bascinet helmet with better overall{vspace=5}characteristics and, as a result, a higher price.{vspace=5}This one also has a bevor and a visor attached.
A version of the bascinet helmet that is popular in northern Italy and{vspace=5}southern France.
A visorless war helmet with a T-shaped opening.
A version of the bascinet helmet equipped with a visor for face{vspace=5}protection.
A version of the bascinet helmet equipped with an eventail. It does{vspace=5}leave the face unprotected, but also is much more comfortable than its{vspace=5}counterparts with visors.
The full combo. Bascinet with a visor and an aventail. It gives as much{vspace=5}protection as a standard helmet can - it doesn't really get any better{vspace=5}than that. Unless you're willing to spend some ridiculous money.
Iconic templar helmet. Does a very good job of protecting the wearer's{vspace=5}head but severely handicaps your ability to hear and see stuff{vspace=5}around you.
Jousting helmet with excellent head and neck protection. However, due{vspace=5}to its enormous weight, can hardly be used in any regular battle that{vspace=5}might last longer than a couple of minutes.
Low-quality self-made hunting bolt with a low-caliber quarrelhead.{vspace=5}The tip of the bolt is covered with poison.
A heavy crossbow bolt designed for penetrating light armor and mostly utilised{vspace=5}for military purposes.{vspace=5}The tip of the bolt is covered with poison.
A fear-inspiring bolt that is purposefully designed to inflict horrendous{vspace=5}flesh wounds and open bleedings.
A fear-inspiring bolt that is purposefully designed to inflict horrendous{vspace=5}flesh wounds and open bleedings.{vspace=5}The tip of the bolt is covered with poison.
Designed to incapacitate the enemy, this bolt severely lacks both damage{vspace=5}dealing and armor-piercing capabilities. It will however inflict considerable{vspace=5}blunt force trauma resulting in heavy stamina damage.
Designed to punch through even the heaviest armor, this bolt poses a serious{vspace=5}threat to any target on the battlefield. Its impressive armor-piercing{vspace=5}capabilities however come as a trade-off for slightly lowered damage.

{color=#A9A9A9}Before his death, Bartholomew asked you to find his family back in{vspace=5}England and tell them about his fate. Unfortunately, he passed away{vspace=5}before he had a chance to tell you where exactly you are supposed to look{vspace=5}for them.
{color=#A9A9A9}A soldier by the name of Bartholomew offered you and several others to{vspace=5}try sneaking into one of the towers at night and stealing some equipment{vspace=5}from the guards. While Bartholomew is convinced that the whole thing{vspace=5}will go smooth, it may be wiser to properly prepare for any possible{vspace=5}outcome.
{color=#A9A9A9}One of the participants of the night heist ended up being caught by the{vspace=5}guards and now is awaiting execution in a dungeon. If you are not{vspace=5}indifferent to his fate it may be worth it to make an attempt at saving{vspace=5}him. Before doing that, however, you have to find out where exactly the{vspace=5}prisoner is being kept...

{color=#A9A9A9}You promised Eva de Lambert that you will not let the English forces to{vspace=5}pillage the villages near Cambrai that belong to her family.
{color=#A9A9A9}Gather provisions from the three villages near the city.{vspace=25}The locals will hardly be pleased to see you, which means it is better{vspace=5}to come prepared.
{color=#A9A9A9}Find and kill Ruffin.
{color=#A9A9A9}Find a poison and hand it over to the Sergeant.{vspace=5}Optionally: find an Antidote and hand it over to the Sergeant.
{color=#A9A9A9}Due to the medicine shortages at the camp, Cecilia cannot guarantee to{vspace=5}save Bartholomew's life. To make sure he lives, she will require{vspace=5}you to fetch some additional medical items - Potent Medicine (x1) and{vspace=5}Antidote II (x1). Finding this stuff at the camp might prove troublesome{vspace=5}and maybe it might be wiser to look elsewhere.
{color=#A9A9A9}Cecilia asked you to find some additional medical items that she could{vspace=5}use to treat the wounded soldiers. She requires Potent Medicine (x2),{vspace=5}Antidote (x2) and Tourniquet (x2).
{color=#A9A9A9}The earl wants you to fetch him several bottles of good wine. It's{vspace=5}pretty easy to get your hands on various kinds of alcohol in the camp.{vspace=5}However, considering the earl's noble tastes and preferences, he most{vspace=5}likely will not be delighted by the idea of drinking the same booze as{vspace=5}the regular soldiers. The solution might lie in paying a visit to some{vspace=5}of the surrounding estates of the French aristocracy and 'convincing'{vspace=5}them to share the contents of their wine cellars.
{color=#A9A9A9}Bartholomew has found out that a wealthy merchant with a gambling habit{vspace=5}will be passing through the camp. He asks you to lend him some money so{vspace=5}he can play with the merchant and (hopefully) strip him of all his cash.
{color=#A9A9A9}The earl and the prince have ordered you to sneak into Cambrai under{vspace=5}the disguise of a monk and get some intelligence about the situation in{vspace=5}the city.{vspace=25}This quest will only check your trinkets - armor and weapons can be kept on.
{color=#A9A9A9}Assassinate William de Roche on the orders of the Prince.{vspace=25}Every morning de Roche takes a ride around the French positions and for{vspace=5}a brief moment ends up near the watchtower, from where he can{vspace=5}theoretically be hit with a crossbow shot. If you don't intend to do this yourself,{vspace=5}then you need to prepare a crossbow with a bolt and also find a decent{vspace=5}shooter, capable of doing the job.
{color=#A9A9A9}Assassinate William de Roche on the orders of the Prince.{vspace=25}Wounded during the previous assassination attempt, de Roche is now placed{vspace=5}under heavy security in the depths of the French camp. Using the surprise{vspace=5}night attack as a distraction, you are to sneak into the camp, find de{vspace=5}Roche and kill him.
{color=#A9A9A9}The Sergeant ordered you to deliver an important message and a shipment{vspace=5}of water to a remote outpost. The road there, in his own words, might be{vspace=5}rather perilous as the French have already attempted several raids in{vspace=5}that area.{vspace=25}Before heading there, you must pick up the water shipment from{vspace=5}the Sergeant.
{color=#A9A9A9}According to Eva, the De Lambert estate has become a shelter for many{vspace=5}refugees from the surrounding villages. The poor souls are desperately{vspace=5}trying to get some trade going so they can make their ends meet and will{vspace=5}be happy to get any money - even from the English.{vspace=25}Spend 150 Florins on various goods in De Lambert estate.
{color=#A9A9A9}Find places near Cambrai that can be looted for supplies to save the army{vspace=5}from starvation.
{color=#A9A9A9}Talk to Olivia and come up with a plan for saving the city.
{color=#A9A9A9}Go on a reconnaissance mission to the three farms around Rennes.{vspace=5}Get more information about the mercenaries and the rebels.
{color=#A9A9A9}Conduct an attack on Olivier's farm.{vspace=5}That will require convincing Dupont that he can trust you and your men{vspace=5}and also increasing Rennes' strength index up to 8.
{color=#A9A9A9}Aid De Guesclin in equipping the City's militia.
{color=#A9A9A9}Go on a walk around Rennes' countryside with Olivia.
{color=#A9A9A9}Convince Dupont to conduct business with Anna's alchemist lab.
{color=#A9A9A9}Collect the medallion from an abandoned chapel for Anna.
{color=#A9A9A9}Completely clear the surroundings of Rennes of all mercenary forces.{vspace=5}Lower the Mercenary's Forces index to 0.
Another Genius Idea
{color=#A9A9A9}According to another genius plan, concocted by the prince and the earl,{vspace=5}you must make an appearance in the court of Count Caldwell and 'impress'{vspace=5}his daughter. After using her influence over her father, you are to{vspace=5}convince the count to lend his forces to your cause and support the{vspace=5}Prince in his struggle against lord Canterbury.{vspace=25}The exact means by which you are supposed to achieve these goals are not{vspace=5}specified.
Sword of Justice
{color=#A9A9A9}Travel to the Lindisfarne abbey and recover the Sword of Justice that{vspace=5}is supposed to be kept there. Despite the fact that in the last decades{vspace=5}the abbey has become somewhat forsaken and desolate, the earl and the{vspace=5}prince tend to think that the sword will still be there.
Death and Taxes
{color=#A9A9A9}Visit the Sheriff of Greenwich under the disguise of a tax collector{vspace=5}and try to find any information linking him to the bandits.

{cps=50}With struggling logistics and the soaring number of wounded, medical supplies are hard to come by at this time.
{cps=50}Another armed conflict between England and France hardly came as a surprise to anyone. The rivalry between the two kingdoms has lasted for more than a century now, with regular border clashes being commonplace. One might have mistaken this war for a similar clash, yet this time the King of England had other plans.
{cps=50}Now Edward III was dead set on ascending the French throne, and its ongoing dynastic crisis would serve as the casus belli.
{cps=50}War preparations by Edward III surpassed the scale of all former military campaigns. Realizing the ambitiousness of his goals, the king was well aware this was not just another war. This was to be the greatest war in history. And for this, the greatest army is in order.
{cps=50}The king began gathering forces long before declaring the war. Long negotiations and uncounted secret agreements bolstered the royal army with numerous allies, as well as mercenaries from all over Europe.
{cps=50}The core of the force inevitably consisted of England's best chivalry. While traditionally reputed to be among the most skilled and worthy knights, they now found themselves in the shadow of the French Chevaliers.
{cps=50}For the honourable knights this coming war was also an opportunity — to amass wealth off its spoils and bask in the glory of victorious battle.
{cps=50}You too ended up among the ranks of the king's countless soldiers. But unlike the knights and mercenaries eagerly enlisting out of their own will, you - a peasant's son - did not have much of a choice. As beside professional warriors, the army also required those to do its dirty work.{vspace=5}Both in the meaning of digging ditches and being able to give up their lives for dirt cheap.
{cps=50}By royal decree, a militia force was drafted from the free folk. Many wealthier people were able to bribe their way out of service, but you - coming from a poor family - had no such opportunity. And thus you received a 'royal' gift for your 18th birthday, an unexpected journey to the shores of France.
{cps=50}Weapon in hand, you suddenly find yourself treading on unfriendly soil. You wonder whether you will ever see your home again...
In the summer of 1339 the English army, led by the king and his son Prince Edward, invaded northern France.
Catching the French by surprise, the king first intended to crush their potential allies in the Low Lands.
To do that the English army needed to capture the large and well-defended city of Cambrai - the center of the Cambrai Archbishopric.
With the Archbishop himself being a devoted ally of the French king, it was obvious that the city would not surrender peacefully - even if threatened by a major force.
Cambrai would have to be sieged and taken by sword.
Your adventure begins in the castle of Dunkirk - a large English stronghold in Northern France.
{cps=50}After spending about a week at Castle Dunkirk the army eventually begins its march to the southwest.
{cps=50}Your regiment has been assigned to the advance guard led by the king's son, Edward of Woodstock - the Prince.
{cps=50}Arriving at Cambrai you see a large French convoy with supplies that is entering through the main gates.
{cps=50}The town obviously has not been prepared to handle a long siege yet and stands vulnerable.
{cps=50}The young prince, eager to prove himself to his father, chooses a daring move - to try and take the city by charging through the yet open gates.
{cps=50}Time is of the essence, so Edward leads the attack immediately.
{cps=50}The Prince spearheads the cavalry charge forward, crushing everything under them and breaking into the city.
{cps=50}You and your fellow militiamen try to follow in their tracks as fast as you can, but the difference in speed is just too great.
{cps=50}By the time you have finally got to the gates, there is already a large group of enemy soldiers, guards and militiamen gathering to block your way...
{cps=50}Enemy formation is crumbling. The battle might be soon coming to an end.
{cps=50}Unable to sustain your attack, the enemies are slowly giving in and soon begin to hastily retreat.
{cps=50}With a pause in the action you take a look around and see several bodies of your dead foes.
{cps=50}Looting, especially during active combat, is generally frowned upon in the army. This however does not deter many soldiers (predominantly from poorer backgrounds) from pillaging their rival's corpses.
{cps=50}Their motives are easy to understand - in war even a single piece of good equipment can make the difference between life and death.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 3!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 2!
{cps=50}Due to the confusion, you manage to overcome the poorly organized defenders in a swift and rather hectic fight.
{cps=50}Their tactical retreat into the walls quickly escalates to a chaotic rout. You storm into the town proper hot on their heels.
{cps=50}Inside the walls however, the situation is already changing.
{cps=50}The prince's knights are struggling to hold against the superior numbers of the French, and slowly but surely are falling back towards the main gates.
{cps=50}The prince could definitely use some infantry support, but rushing to his aid may prove to be a dangerous undertaking.
{cps=50}Not willing to leave Prince Edward in danger, the earl quickly calls for volunteers to join the rescue effort.
{cps=50}The rest are told to hold the city gates for a safe retreat thereafter.
{cps=50}It seems only seasoned and fierce warriors are joining the earl, it's unlikely someone will point a finger at you if you refuse...
{cps=50}...especially given that you are wounded and exhausted, barely able to even stand straight.
{cps=50}This is clearly a good opportunity to prove yourself to the earl, maybe even to the prince himself. But right now, on the other side of the scale lies no less than your own life, and the question is whether or not this is the time to risk it.
{cps=50}Driven by courage and some impulsive honor, you join the daredevils attempting to rescue the prince and his retinue.
{cps=50}Many of your fellow militiamen are openly surprised by your bold move. The earl, his first time noticing you since the start of the campaign, also seems impressed.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) increased by 7!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!
{cps=50}Bartholomew is among them, who notes with a grin that you never cease to amaze him with your recklessness.
{cps=50}However, considering what you have done for him, he simply has no choice but to follow you anywhere.
{cps=50}Drawing his sword, the earl himself leads you into an attack through a narrow street toward the Prince and his men, who are practically surrounded in the town square nearby.
{cps=50}You soon find your path blocked by well-armed soldiers from the town garrison, clearly trying to cut off the prince's party from reinforcements.
{cps=50}You make the level-headed decision to stay at the gates.
{cps=50}The earl and the volunteers arrive just in time to prevent the French from encircling the prince's retinue.
{cps=50}The combined force of the two groups was just enough to fight their way back to the gates.
{cps=50}The battered town defenders hesitate to give chase, and instead settle with the status quo restored.
{cps=50}As you fall back to safety and catch your breath, you are slowly filled with the proud realization that you have just managed to survive your first battle.
{cps=50}While you come back to your senses and tend your wounds, the main force of the English army is steadily approaching the city.
{cps=50}Columns of people, horsemen and wagons, all stretching for several miles, flow from the horizon like an endless river, slowly pouring around the city from all sides.
{cps=50}Having found the sergeant among the survivors, you ask him what will happen now.
{cps=50}He responds with only one word...
{cps=50}Siege.
{cps=50}Seeing that you're having difficulty with your opponent, the sergeant sends another soldier to your aid.
{cps=50}You and the earl arrive just in time to prevent the French from encircling the prince's retinue.
{cps=50}Bloodied and tired, the prince immediately gives the order for a full retreat, which fortunately goes without incident.
{cps=50}However, the pride from this small but well-deserved victory is almost instantly overshadowed by the bitterness of loss when you remember the fate of Bartholomew, who died in the conflict.
{cps=50}With a heavy heart, you swear to avenge him and make the enemy pay in full for the death of your friend.
{cps=50}Over the next few days, you watch as a new full-fledged city gradually grows all around the walls of Cambrai...
{cps=50}Thousands of people, hundreds of tents and awnings, dozens of various siege and assault weapons, and long lines of convoys arrive every day from almost all directions.
{cps=50}You would not dare to call all this a mere 'camp' any longer.
{cps=50}According to the sergeant, who is constantly aware of the goings on, the king will not delay the siege. The success of the entire campaign depends on the speed of this attack, and any further delay will give the French a chance to thoroughly gather their strength.
{cps=50}This is why the usual siege tactic, winning the city through a war of attrition, is not going to fly with Cambrai.
{cps=50}The sergeant says the assault should take place in about a week, when the siege engines are fully deployed and the rest of the reinforcements have caught up with the army.
{cps=50}For now, all you can do is take advantage of what peaceful days remain...
{cps=50}Your journey progresses calmly at first. It is a bright and sunny day, and the forest around you seems tranquil enough.
{cps=50}For once the atmosphere is quite relaxed, and with each steady step your horse takes, you submerge more and more into your own thoughts.
{cps=50}Your father told you more than once that for the poor and low-born, war is a chance to get ahead - if only by getting a head off those who oppose you.
{cps=50}You did not exactly end up here by your own choice, and so far your utmost concern has been your survival, while fame and fortune seem some wishful illusion beyond your reach.
{cps=50}However, opportunities do present themselves from time to time, and one must be utterly blind to ignore those chances.
{cps=50}Nothing good will come out of it if you bite off more than you can chew though, as grandma used to say. No point in rushing toward a prize head first - if you could not keep that head on your shoulders.
{cps=50}Just as you process that thought, a crossbow bolt sticks into a tree right in front of your face with a loud thud, followed by what sounds like heavy swearing in French.
{cps=50}Out of the corner of your eye, you see several figures approaching on foot from different directions. Harbouring no illusions of what is going on, you spur the horse to a gallop in the hope of outrunning your pursuers.
{cps=50}The terrain is rough, with small ravines and tree roots limiting the much desired gallop to a wearying trot.
{cps=50}That is enough to keep some distance from your chasers, but they are persistent, and so far there is no real chance to leave them behind.
{cps=50}Arrows and bolts whiz by you repeatedly, with each successive shot seeming better aimed than the one before.
{cps=50}By cleverly maneuvering between the trees you manage to evade all of them.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Coordination check passed!]
{cps=50}Frantically maneuvering between the trees, you manage to evade some more shots, but this cannot go on forever. The next arrow finds its target and your horse falls from under you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Coordination check failed!]
{cps=50}Though winded, your chasers are now barely fifty yards away...
{cps=50}This can hardly be considered a success, as the disorderly chase draws you yet deeper into the wilderness, with vegetation growing increasingly dense and hard to pass through.
{cps=50}Your pursuers are getting closer by the minute, and your chances of escape seem to slip away.
{cps=50}Having finally cleared the forest, you find yourself just a quarter of an hour's ride from the outpost. The rest of your journey goes free of any interruptions.
{cps=50}You try your best to get back on the road, but your luck has run out. The next arrow finds its target and your horse falls from under you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]
{cps=50}Escape is futile. You dismount and stand your ground, ready for the fight.
{cps=50}The tide of battle starts to change. The confident onslaught of the English, which allowed you to take over a large section of the wall, is now slowly but surely fizzling out.
{cps=50}The French on the other hand, bolstered by fresh reinforcements, begin to press only harder, threatening to push you off the walls very soon.
{cps=50}In the heart of the battle is a tall French knight, who leads and instills spirit into the defenders.{w} He wields a halberd with such confidence and fury it's as if he intends to win the battle all by himself.
{cps=50}Several of your comrades engage him only to fall one by one from his heavy blows.
{cps=50}Seeing victory slip through their fingers, your allies begin to withdraw. Those close to the ladders and siege towers hurriedly descend, while others cover the retreat to try and slow down the French.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!
{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}You bravely join the few soldiers still fighting. The joint effort manages to buy a bit of time to cover your retreating comrades.
{cps=50}Being among the last to leave the walls, you barely manage to escape alive...
...fending off the advancing enemy you lose your shield and helmet, narrowly avoiding imminent death.
{cps=50}Your courage does not go unnoticed however. Your feats have saved more than one of your comrades in arms today, and they regard you with utmost respect.
{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 7!
{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!
{cps=50}Realizing that things are about to go south, you lead the flight and are among the first to leave the wall.
{cps=50} The battle drags on. Maybe, if you hold for a little longer, your allies will come to your aid.
{cps=50}Just when all hope seems lost, you suddenly hear the sounds of trumpets and the stamping of horses, followed by several English riders.
{cps=50}The outnumbered French immediately begin to retreat, leaving you be.
{cps=50}Several cavalrymen set off in pursuit of the fleeing enemy. One comes up to you and, having learned that you are on your way to the western outpost, agrees to take you there.
{cps=50}The rest of the journey, much to your relief, goes smoothly.
{cps=50}At the appointed hour, the whole camp is set in motion and your eyes are presented with a both great and terrifying spectacle.
{cps=50}The volley of dozens of trebuchets and catapults, unleashing a relentless avalanche of boulders on the city, provide cover to the hordes of soldiers rushing towards the fortress walls.
{cps=50}The whistle of arrows, the crash of projectiles, the beat of war drums, the howl of trumpets and the scream of over a thousand voices merge into a single deafening cacophony, in which you can no longer tell any sound apart.
{cps=50}Being in the thick of the assault, you, mere minutes after the start of the attack, can no longer distinguish separate sounds in this surrounding hum that echoes in your head.
{cps=50}An endless rain of arrows and crossbow bolts pour on you from the city walls, only growing stronger the closer you get to the city.
{cps=50}Injured and slain comrades are falling beside you left and right, but by some miracle you manage to not be hit by any arrows yourself.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}Injured and slain comrades are falling beside you left and right, and you too get hit by one of the French arrows, leaving a shallow but painful wound.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check failed!]{vspace=5}Health decreased by 5!
{cps=50}When you finally get to the city walls, a hail of stones rains on you from above.
{cps=50}One of the heavier stones lands directly on Bartholomew's helmet barely two feet away from you.{w} He falls to the ground as blood trickles down his face.
{cps=50}One of the heavier stones lands directly on your fellow soldier's helmet barely two feet away from you.{w} He falls to the ground as blood trickles down his face.
{cps=50}Assisted by several other soldiers, you drag him away. The poor fellow, though still breathing, appears to be unconscious and could fall prey to enemy archers at any moment.
{cps=50}If you leave him lying just like that, that would most likely be his death sentence...
{cps=50}Not willing to abandon him to the whims of fate, you leave his body covered with your shield, sacrificing your own defense.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 20!
{cps=50}You hesitate a moment, deciding whether to cover him with your shield, but you're just not willing to take another risk. Instead you leave him with a silent prayer, calling for a guardian angel to save the injured...{w} As well as yourself.
{cps=50}You decide to keep the shield for yourself.{w} After all, it will be of more use to someone who can still stand on both feet, as opposed to someone with one foot in the grave already.
{cps=50}Luckily for him, the sergeant happens to be nearby and covers the injured with his shield.
{cps=50}As you try to catch your breath, you look around for the ladders that should already be in place. Or that was the plan, anyway, as they are nowhere to be seen...
{cps=50}While you continue searching, trying to make sense of anything in the clouds of dust and smoke enveloping you, a chaotic fight ensues.
{cps=50}Taking full advantage of the state of disarray, a group of enemy soldiers emerges from the haze and attacks your troop...
{cps=50}Enemy attack seems to be stifled. The battle might be soon coming to an end.
{cps=50}The daring sortie of the French fails to push you back from the walls.
{cps=50}The attackers could not grind down your troop in time, and soon find themselves surrounded by arriving reinforcements who overrun them.
{cps=50}You get a short breather...
{cps=50}The defenders keep throwing stones and shooting arrows at you, but the shower of missiles seems to be dwindling. The siege engines sing for their supper well enough, shattering the walls with every hit.
{cps=50}With the arrival of reinforcements, the siege ladders finally make an appearance as well. And by Northampton's order, they are immediately propped against the walls.
{cps=50}In an attempt to encourage the men, the earl promises a handsome reward as well as a doubled share of spoils to the first soldier who sets foot atop the walls.{w} Despite this generous offer, your fellow militiamen seem to have little enthusiasm for the idea...
{cps=50}Northampton looks around for someone who might serve as an example to the rest of the soldiers, and soon fixes his eyes on you.
{cps=50}Seemingly pleased with your past achievements, he announces that someone of your courage and skill is well-suited to lead the assault.
{cps=50}Risks be damned, not willing to let the earl down you rush forward and lead the charge, climbing one of the ladders.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) increased by 5!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!
{cps=50}Any thoughts of wealth and glory begin to fade as more and more heavy stones fall from above.
{cps=50}Barely dodging the first one, you raise your shield above you and deflect the next few.
{cps=50}Having to keep the shield in front of you, the rest of your climb proceeds at a slow pace.
{cps=50}You evade the first projectile, but the next one is well-aimed and heads straight toward your face.{w} Without a shield all you can do is use your hand for cover, which bears the brunt of the blow.
{cps=50}Judging by the sudden sharp pain, your hand has been seriously damaged by the impact. Still, you manage to stay on the ladder.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Health decreased by 5!
{cps=50}Their screams urge you forward and a few moments later you set foot atop the wall.
{cps=50}Several enemy soldiers attack you at once, and the only thing you can do now is defend yourself - hoping for reinforcements...
{cps=50}You are not about to lead a suicidal attack, so you make way for several other daredevils willing to be the first to go up.
{cps=50}Climbing the wall is neither easy nor safe even in the second wave.
{cps=50}All other thoughts fade from your mind as heavy rocks fall from above.
{cps=50}Their screams urge you forward and a few moments later you set foot atop the wall, where several English soldiers are already fighting the defenders.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 7!
{cps=50}More and more allies climb the wall in your wake. They potently push the defenders back and gain a substantial foothold on the wall.
{cps=50}Seeing that you are bleeding and can barely stand, your allies quickly allow you to recede into the back of the formation, covering you with their shields.
{cps=50}Seeing that you are injured, your allies quickly allow you to recede into the back of the formation, covering you with their shields.
{cps=50}Realizing that your life hangs by a thread, you use this opportunity to fall back behind their shields.
{cps=50}Though still able to put up a fight, you use this opportunity to fall back behind their shields and let others risk their lives.
{cps=50}Despite your wounds, you are not going to retreat.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}However, you are not going to retreat.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}At the camp, it becomes evident that all attempts to take the town end with the very same result.
{cps=50}English troops attacked the walls from several directions simultaneously, which was supposed to disperse the defending forces, but none of the attacking parties managed to achieve a decisive breakthrough.
{cps=50}Heavy fighting took place at several sections of the wall at once. Some watchtowers were captured, but none of the attacks could build further success.
{cps=50}At the camp you see disgruntled knights and lords, as well as hordes of injured soldiers, while the smoking but yet impregnable town walls dominate the background. You can't shake the thought you may be stuck here for some time.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}After the disastrous, almost catastrophic assault, the entire camp plunges into licking its wounds.
{cps=50}Almost all units in the royal army suffered substantial losses. Your squad is no exception, this battle has cost you more than a dozen men dead or wounded.
{cps=50}Among the badly wounded is your friend Bartholomew, who was first hit by a stone thrown from the wall, then he took an arrow to the knee and lost much blood.
{cps=50}Once the inglorious assault is over, you waste no time and promptly help bring him to Cecilia. After seeing the distress in your eyes, she agrees to tend to Bartholomew despite being overwhelmed by the amount of other wounded.
{cps=50}Bartholomew's condition is rather grave and she promises no miracles. Cecilia grants you she will do her utmost, but does emphasize now is not the time for unbridled optimism.
{cps=50}Once the inglorious assault is over, you waste no time and promptly help bring him to the medics. They warn you right away that the chance of recovery is rather slim.
{cps=50}The medics do promise to do what is in their power, but as you look around the overcrowded infirmary you harbour no illusions that your friend will get the most of their attention.
{cps=50}Bartholomew needs a top-notch doctor, otherwise he is as good as gone.
{cps=50}...
{cps=50}Nonetheless, let us get back to events of a bigger scale.
{cps=50}As it happens, the assault was a mixed blessing - the troublesome John Hoggard, the person who everyone wanted gone, is gone indeed.
{cps=50}That is one less headache to worry about.
Nonetheless, let us get back to events of a bigger scale.
{cps=50}The king, who is cross as two sticks, is rumored to have cast all the blame upon the lords and their uncoordinated actions, who did not bother with mutual support and simply sought an opportunity to capitalize on the other's success, so as to pop up in the right place at the right time and take all the credit.
{cps=50}As a result, the most battle-worthy and elite troops have wasted most of their time waiting for the right moment to arrive at the tipping point of the battle.
{cps=50}Such indecisiveness has cost several missed opportunities, including the foothold that you were able to acquire at one of the walls.
{cps=50}Now the king and his inner circle are set to plan another, more elaborate attempt to take Cambrai, leaving nothing to chance or self-will.
{cps=50}The earl and the prince, eager to prove themselves before the king, delve into laying out a cunning plan to penetrate the town walls.
{cps=50}The peasants fight stubbornly for a time, but seeing you slaughter them one by one they gradually lose confidence and soon begin to flee, throwing away their weapons.
{cps=50}Several dead bodies of your slain enemies are laying on the abandoned battlefield.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 3!
{cps=50}The air in the camp is filled with tension as the English army is getting on for the second decisive assault. The initial plan of a lightning-fast campaign and advance into the French territory, as envisioned by the king, is not just at risk, it is coming apart at the seams. Any delay will result in incalculable risks.
{cps=50}Reports from the farthest sentries indicate that Jean II is already pulling in troops from all across France to the borders of the province. If the reports are accurate, there are about thousands of knights, including the very best of the French Chevaliers.
{cps=50}Lingering at Cambrai for one more week is clearly tantamount to suicide. The English army is at risk of being cornered, with the coming French shock cavalry as the hardest-hitting hammer to complement the anvil of the town walls.
{cps=50}Wanting to delay the advance of the French troops in time for another decisive assault, the king allocates about a quarter of his troops to Thomas Marshall, a prominent English commander, to intercept and set back Jean's army.
{cps=50}This risky move leaves no doubt that what happens in the next few days will determine the outcome of the campaign.
{cps=50}The tension quickly spreads from lords and knights to sergeants and mere soldiers. By the time of the planned assault the whole army is on edge, realizing that the fate of everyone involved will be decided in the coming battle...
{cps=50}The assault starts with a barrage from the siege engines, just as the previous one. Your commanders learned from their mistakes however.
{cps=50}This time the siege engines' fire is focused on several forechosen spots that have been deemed the most vulnerable points of defense.
{cps=50}Tattered by the siege, the fortifications can barely withstand the powerful onslaught. Some walls and towers start to give way and fall, creating gaps in what seemed an impenetrable line of defense barely an hour ago.
{cps=50}Some of the most devastating blows fall upon the south wall. As about a quarter of the wall literally comes apart under trebuchet fire, the king declares this section as the main route and sounds the attack.
{cps=50}The earl is reluctant to mindlessly risk his best people, so he holds you and other valued fighters on standby, letting the others do the dirty work.
{cps=50}You have had your brush with fame during the previous assaults, so you keep your cool and let the others take this opportunity now.
{cps=50}In about half an hour a messenger reports that the south wall is almost taken, but the first wave of the attackers is bogged down in battle on the city streets and needs support.
{cps=50}The second wave, heading to the south wall, is led by the prince himself. This time he received the simplest instructions from the king - to return either victorious or dead.
{cps=50}Despite the earl's attempts to deter you, you charge with the first wave, as you refuse to sit back while your comrades risk their lives and shed their blood. {color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) improved by 15!{vspace=5}Reputation (the earl) decreased by 3!
{cps=50}The first wave is met with an avalanche of arrows and bolts from the fortress walls, hitting every other soldier that rushes towards it.
{cps=50}Several of your comrades fall dead right beside you, but you remain unharmed.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}One of the arrows hits you too, leaving a shallow but painful wound.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Agility check failed!]{vspace=5}Health lowered by 5!
{cps=50}Bursting into the city through the destroyed wall, you immediately start pushing back the defenders and nearly force them to flee, when suddenly a knight appears behind the French soldiers, quickly giving them orders.
{cps=50}Under his command, the French soldiers who were just fighting in a disorderly heap immediately reorganize into a single wall of shields and confidently repel attack after attack ...
{cps=50}Fighting like a lion, you almost manage to single-handedly do the impossible - to break through the wall of shields formed by the French.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) increased by 10!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}Attacking over and over again, you incapacitate one enemy after another. Inspired by your courage, other soldiers begin to fight more boldly, and now the prince is able to launch a new powerful attack that sweeps away the French defense.
{cps=50}The unknown French knight, surrounded by his people, is trying to keep the formation to the end, but your force quickly becomes too overwhelming and he has to retreat too.
{cps=50}But before disappearing with those fleeing, he manages to catch your eye. In his eyes blazing with anger, a very simple message can be read ...
{cps=50}'We'll meet again.'
{cps=50}This time there can be no doubt - the enemy is fleeing and the city is almost taken.
{cps=50}The shield wall put up by the French is absolutely monolithic and does not step back an inch, no matter how much you try to break it.
{cps=50}Seeing the resilience of the French, your soldiers clearly realize the instability of their own position. Losing more and more confidence every minute they are now ready to flee themselves.
{cps=50}The only thing preventing immediate defeat is the adamance of the prince, who despite all that is going wrong is able to force the soldiers to hold the formation.
{cps=50}And they hold it - by gritting their teeth and gathering the last of their strength. But that is all they can do.
{cps=50}It becomes more and more apparent that you will probably have to forget about the decisive victory you dreamed about going into this battle...
{cps=50}The moment you almost come to terms with failure, something completely unexpected happens.
{cps=50}Bartholomew rushes out somewhere from the depths of your formation, and with a wild cry he jumps straight onto the wall of French shields.
{cps=50}Under any other circumstances, such a move would inevitably result in Bartholomew's death, however, the French are exhausted as much as you are and now barely stand on their feet. The soldiers behind the shield wall don't have much time to react, but also don't have enough strength left to withstand the blow of his body slamming into them.
{cps=50}The impact of Bartholomew's body instantly knocks down several soldiers closest to him. Their falling immediately causes a domino effect and after a few seconds almost the entire center of the French formation is knocked down.
{cps=50}The prince, realizing that we might just have been given a chance, immediately sends everyone into a new attack, which he personally leads.
{cps=50}And you are the first to break into the crumpled formation of the French.
{cps=50}The French have no time to come to their senses after Bartholomew's move and are demolished by your attack. Exhausted by the long battle, the French soldiers realize that they can no longer recover and soon begin to flee in panic.
{cps=50}Now nothing stands in your way to the city.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) increased by 5!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}The fire that was raging in you and your comrades finally dies out, and the assault along with it.
{cps=50}The last one to accept the inevitable defeat is the prince, who has no choice but to sound the retreat.
{cps=50}As the French, who realize that they have just held their ground, start shouting triumphantly, encouraged by the unknown knight, you back down barely able to fend off the pursuers.
{cps=50}In the heat of the battle the retreat turns into a rout. You get outside the town walls, but around you is confusion, no one seems to know what to do next.
{cps=50}Clouds of dust and smoke surround you and you can barely make out vague figures of either friend or foe scurrying around. Half-destroyed walls still hurl bolts and arrows, from which the dead and wounded keep falling.
{cps=50}Half-dazed you stagger around trying to find someone in command, but neither the prince nor the earl are to be found. Not even the sergeant.
{cps=50}Having come to terms with the helplessness of your situation, you make the only reasonable decision  - go back to the camp. Most of the attackers end up heading there anyways.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}......{w}{vspace=5}...
{cps=50}You make it back to the camp... somehow. You are completely sure that the battle is lost, so you are totally caught by surprise when you start seeing... triumphant faces around?
{cps=50}As it turns out, while you were trying to take the south wall, Lord Canterbury and his men managed to take Cambrai's northern wall that was also damaged by the barrage...{w}The town has been taken more than an hour ago.
{cps=50}All you can do now is bless your stars for staying alive.
{cps=50}The victory almost slipped through your fingers, so you can hardly believe your own eyes as the tide turns around. After several long months of siege, the town is finally taken.
{cps=50}You were among the first English troops to enter the town, so you were able to take great spoils of war.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+150 Florins!
{cps=50}In the evening the king holds a big feast in honor of the victory. It has been a long time since you could relax and unwind like this, and it dawns on you that you are doing not half bad actually.
{cps=50}Unlike many of your comrades in arms you are still alive, active and in good standing with the earl, who is open to promoting you.
{cps=50}This positive thinking leaves you with a strange new sensation that was not there a moment ago... Confidence? You sleep well with this on your mind.
{cps=50}Once you get to Cambrai several hours later, the town is already sacked and looted. No spoils left for latecomers like you.
{cps=50}Understandably he took the richest spoils. What is more important, however, is that due to his recent success he is now virtually immune to any accusations related to the incident in the village. So much for your righteous retribution.
{cps=50}Per Edward's plan, the victory at Cambrai should have been the opening to proceed inland. No one planned to stay in the captured town for long. But what happened the next morning was exactly what everyone was trying to avoid...{w} French colours appeared on the horizon.
{cps=50}The king realizes that his army needs time to recover, and makes the unexpected decision to harbour his troops in the town and its outskirts, expecting the walls to do him as good a service as they did the French.
{cps=50}In just one day you turn from the besiegers into the besieged.
{cps=50}The king knew about the French getting closer, so the arriving army was no surprise in itself.
{cps=50}Their numbers however appeared to be much higher than expected. The initial willingness to give battle to the French now falls into uncertainty.
{cps=50}By staying several months at Cambrai, the English army has lost its main advantage - pace. Now there is no way they can move inland and crush the French piecemeal as initially planned.
{cps=50}You find yourself locked in a badly damaged town that was nearly turned to ruin mere days ago.
{cps=50}By good fortune, the French also appear to be reluctant to attack despite their numerical advantage. So the assault that was feared from the very moment they appeared on the horizon, did not come to pass.
{cps=50}In fact, the French do not even bother to encircle the town, content with blocking main exits and establishing patrols over the rest of the perimeter.
{cps=50}More surprising news is that the monarchs got around the table to negotiate peace.
{cps=50}Whether the negotiations will bear any fruit remains to be seen.
{cps=50}The attack causes great turmoil in the French camp. All battle-ready soldiers are being hastily redeployed, and the far side of the camp, where you plan to infiltrate, is left almost unguarded.
{cps=50}Much to your surprise you manage to get inside the camp without fanfare. Reluctantly, you have to admit that the prince's idea seems to be actually working.
{cps=50}As you approach the tent, where the injured de Roche is said to be in, your luck suddenly runs out — as the entrance is well protected by a group of heavily armed warriors.
{cps=50}You have no time to mess around. If you have to deal with the guards, you must do it fast. Otherwise they will find reinforcements and that will be the end of you.
{cps=50}You attack with a battle cry.
{cps=50}Under the cover of utter chaos, you manage to deal with the guards before anyone can make heads or tails of it.
{cps=50}The fight drags on. Kill de Roche's guards quickly or you will have to take flight.
{cps=50}Your attack is repelled. The French start getting reinforcements and you hastily retreat.
{cps=50}The earl is obviously not pleased with the news of your failure. He makes it clear that failing such an important task twice has greatly undermined his trust in you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}The prince does not exert severe criticism, but points out that the night diversion to distract the French has cost the English army about a hundred brave warriors who did not come back.
{cps=50}Sadder still is that the failure of this gambit cements the French army's superiority. The only recourse is for Edward to negotiate peace.
{cps=50}It's clear as day that the conditions will not be favourable.
{cps=50}Failing to kill William de Roche puts an end to any hopes of defeating the French with a decisive military action.
{cps=50}Over the next week, several English lords, unwilling to admit the unfavourable outcome of the war, test the strength of the French through multiple skirmishes near Cambrai's walls.
{cps=50}None of them were of any real significance though, and there is no serious success for either side.
{cps=50}As de Roche gradually recovers and regains control over the army with each passing day, the French troops become more and more militant, proving the seriousness of their intent and forcing Edward to speed up negotiations.
{cps=50}A formal truce was concluded shortly thereafter, ceasing active fighting. The siege had not yet been uplifted really, but high-ranking English commanders and knights, as well as their retinues, were allowed to move freely through the town gates in and out.
{cps=50}While the patrols were still there, and arms were still kept at the ready, it was clear to everyone that a full-fledged peace treaty was around the corner.
{cps=50}As per tradition, a peace treaty ending hostilities between the two kingdoms is followed by a joint hunt, attended by both kings.
{cps=50}This time the hunting grounds were chosen to be the forest west of Cambrai, an area owned by the de Lambert family.
{cps=50}Among the fifty noblemen on both sides who were to accompany the two sovereigns, naturally, there was the earl, who decided to take you along as a bodyguard.
{cps=50}Among the fifty noblemen on both sides who were to accompany the two sovereigns, naturally, there was the earl, who the king entrusted to muster bodyguards from his troop for this undertaking.
{cps=50}You were chosen among other soldiers.
{cps=50}The 'Royal Hunt' looks surprisingly just like a regular one, reminding you of the times your father would take you along on them.
{cps=50}The only difference is that you and your father had never decided the fate of the entire continent while stalking a boar.{w} Also, ale and wine did not flow like a river exactly.
{cps=50}You were enlisted as a guard, but this duty feels like you are a hodman so far. As you accompany the earl, who keeps his retinue somewhat at a distance from the kings and their retinues, all you do is bring bottles full of wine in return for the empty ones and reload crossbows.
{cps=50}In the constant commotion around you, you keep spotting familiar faces among the noblemen covered in silk and gold.
{cps=50}Just ahead is the prince, who is accompanying the kings. The kings, it looks like, are more thrilled by the hunt than the tiny legal details of the peace agreement.
{cps=50}The earl interchanges remarks with de Roche, who barely escaped death, recalling the war in Scotland. From the sound of it, they managed to scar each other more times than one.
{cps=50}Thomas Marshall, who has been defeated by de Roche, has been set free and now laughs loudly over something with the French commander of Cambrai, who had been taken captive during the last assault and also granted freedom.
{cps=50}Lord Sunderland, an avid fan of fistfights, is having a hushed but animated conversation with Lord Canterbury, the commander of mercenary troops hired from all over Europe.
{cps=50}Just behind Lord Sunderland is Fulton Everly, whose hide you tanned just recently.
{cps=50}Just behind Lord Sunderland is the smiling Fulton Everly, who tanned your hide just recently.
{cps=50}Looking around, you can take this for anything but a peace negotiation between the leaders of two armies that just tried so hard to erase each other.
{cps=50}At the third hour you start being pretty wary of 'gimme this - gimme that' kinds of requests. Every now and then you take a few good sips from the bottles you bring to your superiors, gradually losing focus and having difficulty understanding who is where.
{cps=50}A loud outcry jerks you out of this languid state. Turning your head in search of the source of the noise, you are surprised to see people around you beginning to fall to the ground one by one, wheezing.
{cps=50}Still gathering your wits, you stumble over a huge body that has just collapsed to the ground in front of you. As you rise from the fall, you recognize it as Fulton Everly.
{cps=50}His face is covered with blood and there is a crossbow bolt sticking out his throat.
{cps=50}Sobered by this unexpected sight you jump to your feet... Just to find yourself in the middle of mayhem.
{cps=50}Around you is the most confusing fight you have ever witnessed. Only with great difficulty can you tell apart likely allies from likely foes.
{cps=50}Neither the prince nor the earl can be seen nearby, and the only at least partly familiar face belongs to Lord Canterbury, who fights off the French king's bodyguards assisted by his own men.
{cps=50}Relieved that you finally managed to distinguish one of your allies, you immediately join the fight on the side of Lord Canterbury and his retinue.
{cps=50}Tutorial: Fighting against crossbowmen{vspace=25}Crossbows are an extremely powerful weapon, and during your adventures you will undoubtedly encounter many enemies armed with one.
{cps=50}You can tell that an enemy is armed with a crossbow by checking his inventory.
{cps=50}If you hover the mouse pointer over the crossbow image, you will get detailed info such as crossbow type, amount of crossbow skill the character has, ammo count and bolt type.
{cps=50}Enemies who are armed with crossbows can have different patterns of behavior which will determine how much they rely on ranged combat. Some might use their crossbow very occasionally while others will use it as their primary weapon.
{cps=50}Some injuries can severely impact crossbow performance. While wielding a melee weapon with one hand is certainly viable, taking a good shot with a crossbow usually requires both hands to be operational.
{cps=50}That means that one of the best ways to decrease a crossbowman's combat efficiency is to injure his arm.
{cps=50}Crossbowmen can also be effectively countered by successful feints and eye injuries.

{cps=50}You decide to teach that rascal a lesson with your fists. Since starting a fight here would be subject to harsh punishment, you devise a more appropriate course of action...

{cps=50}Not wanting to start an unnecessary fight, you decide to joke your way out of this.

{cps=50}He readily agrees and you both head towards the wall. However, as soon as you are distracted from him, your journey is vulgarly interrupted by a series of hard blows that come at you from behind.
{cps=50}Any chance to defend yourself is lost in the first seconds of the fight. Before you know it, you are lying down in the dirt, your head aches, and there is a distinct taste of blood in your mouth.
{cps=50}As you regain consciousness, you remember something your father once told you - 'Honor is for the knights, damsels, and pompous fools'.
{cps=50}During an active military campaign any army enacts severe restrictions on alcohol consumption.{w} However, as it happens, any soldier determined and willing enough to drink can do so almost unchecked.
{cps=50}Knights and nobles have it even easier. There is not much to do in the camp in between battles, so it is not entirely uncommon to see an inebriated knight - or a dead drunk one for that matter.
{cps=50}When it comes to drinking the undisputed champion among the earl's retinue is a knight by the name of John Hoggard. He owns a small scrap of land somewhere in Kent and is related to the earl matrilineally.
{cps=50}He is not exactly a pleasant person to deal with when he is sober, and he is a real devil incarnate to anyone unlucky enough to be nearby when he is drunk.
{cps=50}To your surprise, a significant share of the troubles ends up with the sergeant. Once Hoggard kills the bottle, he starts pestering the sergeant by grilling him on the war in Scotland, which Hoggard missed due to some illness.
{cps=50}This would not normally be a problem if he just wanted to hear the same old stories over and over.{w} But having heard enough tales and imbued with the spirit of adventure, Hoggard drafts a dozen recruits from the militia or squires and makes them play out scenarios from the sergeant's tales for hours, with him being the sergeant, the real sergeant being the earl, and everyone else being the Scots.
{cps=50}Again, this would not be a problem in itself, but for some reason Hoggard always tries to hit the fake Scots with his full strength, and sometimes even forsakes the blunt training weapons for his own sharp combat sword instead.{w} The earl, for obvious reasons, prefers to dismiss the numerous appeals.
{cps=50}As a result the sergeant, who has had enough of this crap, summons you and suggests you take care of the Hoggard issue off your own bat.
{cps=50}The plan is simple enough -  mix Hoggard's booze with a weak but painful poison. The small dose should obviously not kill him, but he will still have a time to remember.
{cps=50}To make sure Hoggard won't actually drop dead it would be nice to acquire the antidote as well. The sergeant, however, leaves that to your discretion.
{cps=50}Whatever happens will likely be attributed to acute delirium tremens. That should bring Hoggard to reason and make him resist the temptations of alcohol in the future.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - A Нole In My Neighbourhood.
{cps=50}The sergeant was sure a small amount of poison would not pose any danger to the drunkard, but things took an unexpected development.
{cps=50}Hoggard had barely started another one of his epic boozy sessions when he suddenly became sober and reported severe indisposition and pain.
{cps=50}While Hoggard was swearing by God to give up drinking, bystanders swiftly took him to the doctor. But before the doctor managed to do him any good... Hoggard had gasped his last.
{cps=50}Hoggard's addiction to alcohol was hardly a secret to anyone, so everyone wrote his death off as an accident.
{cps=50}The qualms of conscience are going to be harder to avoid than accusations of abetting a murder though. All kinds of ill-favoured thoughts torment you for a long time yet.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!
{cps=50}The only consolation are numerous praises from your fellow militiamen, whom you relieved of a huge thorn in their side... Even though the method was not exactly kind.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!{vspace=5}+25 Florins!
{cps=50}Hoggard seemed on the verge of dropping dead and swore by God to give up drinking. Bystanders swiftly took him to the doctor where the sergeant managed to quietly pour the antidote down the drunkard's throat.
{cps=50}A couple of days later Hoggard gets back on his feet, but stays true to his vow and avoids alcohol like the plague.
{cps=50}You receive numerous praises from your fellow militiamen.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!{vspace=5}+25 Florins!
{cps=50}Having spent a bit of time in the camp you gradually get to know and make friends with various people — including several other young men drafted for the militia.
{cps=50}All of you have quite a lot in common including the fact that — originating from poor families — you were forced to go to war without anything even remotely resembling decent weapons or armor.
{cps=50}One of the guys, going by the name Bartholomew and having a rather shady past, suggests you fix this situation and presents you with a plan.
{cps=50}His idea is to 'borrow' the necessary equipment from someone who is not in such a dire need as you - the guards of castle Dunkirk that is towering above your camp.
{cps=50}According to Bartholomew, the men guarding the castle are 'guards' in name only. They have been drafted from the surrounding countryside just as the war started and they can barely tell which side of the halberd goes towards the enemy.
{cps=50}Security is as bad as it gets, so sneaking into one of the armories in the far tower should be a piece of cake.
{cps=50}Everything else would be figured out on site. Bartholomew claims he will take care of any locks that could be found there, so you just have to grab and carry away as much armor and weapons as you please.
{cps=50}Several soldiers are rather impressed and willing to try. They already plan to pull it off this night.
{cps=50}You and several other soldiers are willing to take part. Bartholomew insists you don't dillydally and go at midnight.
{cps=50}You agree to meet at the watchtower at midnight.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 3!{vspace=5}New quest - Castle Нeist.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have just got your first quest. All active quests are listed under Quests & Travel along with a description and tasks that must be completed. Some quests have multiple stages. The description will change accordingly as you progress.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Many quests that require you to have a specific item, skill, or perk, can be completed by interaction with non-player characters.
{cps=50}You refuse. The risk is too high and it is not worth the trouble.
{cps=50}Bartholomew seems displeased and promises you will remember this moment once you face ironclad French knights and armed to the teeth Flemish mercenaries.
{cps=50}Before letting you go he demands you keep your mouth shut or else he will get back at you even from the grave, should you let out their plan.
{cps=50}Despite your refusal to take part in Bartholomew's plan, you could not get it off your mind the whole day.
{cps=50}You consider yourself an honest man and despise dishonorable enterprises whatever form they may take. Now that you know of the upcoming theft, and it 'is' a theft despite Bartholomew's high rhetorics, you were unable to fall asleep.
{cps=50}The thought that you knew about Bartholomew's plan and did not prevent a crime, making you almost an abettor, haunts your mind.
{cps=50}The last thing you'd like to hear tomorrow is that three addle-brained, but otherwise quite decent, folks got chopped to pieces near the watchtower at a theft attempt.
{cps=50}Shortly before midnight, when thoughts and feeling downright eliminate your ability to sleep, you sneak from the tent and hide in the camp.
{cps=50}Watching from the hiding spot you notice that Bartholomew and two other fellows get up and go towards the farthest watchtower, keeping to the shades.
{cps=50}You are determined to stop the upcoming crime and potentially save some lives, so you abandon your hiding spot and go looking for someone who can help.
{cps=50}Luckily for you, in just a few moments you run into the sergeant on his way to take a leak.
{cps=50}He is taken aback, but you manage to convince him. The sergeant and a couple of other men rush into the dark after Bartholomew, swords gleaming.
{cps=50}You, on the contrary, with a feeling of a duty accomplished, return to your tent to get some sleep.
{cps=50}When you are awake, the morning news is not what you expected.
{cps=50}The sergeant and his men did manage to apprehend Bartholomew and his cronies, only that it happened when Bartholomew's party was on the way back, wearing 'freshly acquired' gear.
{cps=50}In the dark it took the sergeant quite some time to persuade the petty thieves to surrender peacefully, and both sides were on the verge of a bloody fight.
{cps=50}In the end they managed to avoid bloodshed, but the turmoil they have caused was enough to finally wake up the castle guards, who immediately found out their gear had gone missing. The guardsmen, headed by two local knights, demanded not just the stolen gear, but also the thieves, obviously for their righteous justice.
{cps=50}The sergeant immediately realized that things were about to get real tough and compromised - the guardsmen got one thief and the sergeant's word that he will administer proper punishment upon the other two.
{cps=50}For obvious reasons it was Bartholomew who was handed to the guards. Now, according to the camp gossip, he is being held in one of the castle cells waiting for his execution.
{cps=50}The other two got away cheap - the sergeant ordered them whipped and bereaved them of a part of this month's pay.
{cps=50}When you face them in the camp, it almost comes down to a fight, as they both blame this disaster on you.
{cps=50}Soon many other of your fellow soldiers start giving you the cold shoulder, obviously disapproving of what you've done. The sergeant however, when you speak to him face-to-face, makes it clear that you've done the right thing and helped maintain the camp in proper order.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 10!{vspace=5}Sergeant became your friend.
{cps=50}Initially you wanted to spill it all out and thwart Bartholomew's plan, but now that you carefully thought it through, you decided to get out of the way.
{cps=50}Ultimately what they are about to pull off is hardly a real 'crime'. You will all soon move forward and face the real enemy, so you needed that gear way more than some glossy-skin guardsmen who stay at an unassailable fortress far from any real danger.
{cps=50}With this in mind you return to your tent and get some sleep, allowing things to take their course.
{cps=50}Bartholomew, clearly skilled in the local geography, confidently leads you along a hidden path through a ravine and dense thickets of bushes. After about a quarter of an hour this way, you finally let yourself into the tower through a secret entrance.
{cps=50}Inside, Bartholomew once again instructs you, forbidding you to make any sounds and requiring you to move completely silently.
{cps=50}Trying to find the weapons room in the endless maze of passages, doors and stairs that represent the interior of the tower, you find yourself on the creaking plank floor of one of the galleries.
{cps=50}One by one, your comrades manage to carefully walk on it, without making any unnecessary sounds. It's your turn now...
{cps=50}Gently stepping on the boards with the grace of a domestic cat, you overcome the obstacle without any problems.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}After another quarter of an hour of strenuous wanderings and games of hide and seek with sleepy guards, you finally manage to reach the cherished armory.
{cps=50}While you and two comrades are watching the situation, Bartholomew is busy with the lock.
{cps=50}You are starting to get worried, but a couple of minutes later he draws your attention with a low whistle and, smiling, invites you with a gesture to the now open door.
{cps=50}The choice of weapons and equipment that awaits you inside turns out to be not very impressive, but it still looks very solid.
{cps=50}You try your best not to make noise, however, as it quickly becomes apparent, agility and grace are hardly your main virtues.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check failed!]
{cps=50}And what is even worse, this becomes obvious not only to you and your comrades but also to those from whom you would prefer to hide this fact about yourself.
{cps=50}The piercing creak of the boards immediately attracts the attention of several guards, who until that moment were peacefully snoring in one of the adjacent rooms.
{cps=50}At the risk of being cut off from your escape route, the four of you run away without saying a word.
{cps=50}A tactical retreat quickly turns into a stampede, and soon everyone is on their own.
{cps=50}In the chaos of the chase, you quickly go astray and get lost in the maze of tower passages, buzzing with loud voices and the stamping of many feet.
{cps=50}Only by sheer luck do you manage to get out and get back to the camp in a roundabout way.
{cps=50}Still not believing in your miraculous escape, you fall asleep.
{cps=50}In the morning, far from the most pleasant news awaits you - the whole camp is buzzing with rumors that this night a group of spies attacked the castle...
{cps=50}...no one knows what exactly they were trying to pull off, however, thanks to the vigilance of the guards, their dirty plans were thwarted.
{cps=50}Two bastards were hacked to death on the spot while resisting arrest, and another was captured alive.
{cps=50}Now, according to rumors, he is sitting in one of the castle dungeons and soon will get executed. If lucky, everyone will be able to see it before dispatch.
{cps=50}After such news, you can only shrug your shoulders.
{cps=50}{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - Jailbird.
{cps=50}Having picked up everything that you liked, you hastily embark on the return journey.
{cps=50}Luck seems to be smiling at you and the journey back goes without incident.
{cps=50}But suddenly, in the dark corridor, one of the doors opens before your nose...
{cps=50}...and you find yourself face to face with a guard emerging from there.
{cps=50}Hardly making out your outlines in the dark, he asks who is in front of him. You don't really know what to do now and glance at Bartholomew and his comrades, who have gone a little ahead. They are desperately signaling something to you with their hands, but you cannot distinguish their gestures in the dark.
{cps=50}The situation quickly becomes critical.
{cps=50}Realizing how desperate your situation is, you make a decision that seems to you to be the only right one and, gathering all your strength into a fist, land a sweeping hook to the jaw for the guard.
{cps=50}Perhaps from your epic strength, or perhaps simply from the sudden drowsiness, the guard falls to the ground like a bag, and you headlong rush to flee.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Strength check passed!]
{cps=50}Running for your dear life away from the tower, you cannot get rid of the feeling that they are already chasing you and you are about to be caught...
{cps=50}But when, after a few minutes, you finally find yourself outside by the ravine, you are surprised to realize that the silence around you at night is not disturbed by anything except your own heavy breathing.
{cps=50}Bartholomew pats you on the shoulder with a friendly grin, praising your determination. He also adds something about the 'good old days', but you don't quite understand what he is talking about.
{cps=50}Safely returning to the camp, you fall asleep, thinking about the adventures you have just experienced and realizing that you may have just made new good friends.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!{vspace=5}Bartholomew became your friend.
{cps=50}Despite the fact that you strike with all your strength, the punch turns out to be too weak and frankly unsuccessful.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Strength check failed!]
{cps=50}The guard instantly recovers from the attack, immediately grabs the sword hanging from his belt, and, loudly calling for help, begins to swing it left and right.
{cps=50}By some miracle, dodging his blows, you run away with all your might. Somewhere ahead of you, your comrades are also running in panic.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}In the chaos of the chase, it becomes every man for himself and you quickly go astray and get lost in the maze of tower passages, buzzing with loud voices and the stamping of many feet.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - Jailbird.
{cps=50}{cps=50}Backing away from his blows, you stumble, and the blade of the sword reaches you, leaving a shallow but painful wound.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check failed!]
{cps=50}Jumping up from the floor, you run away.
{cps=50}Pushing the guard away from you, you run with all your might, hoping to escape before he has time to overtake you.
{cps=50}Somewhere behind your back, wild cries of a guard are heard, alerting everyone around you of your presence.
{cps=50}As you wind through the twisted corridors, remembering your way back, the tower around you awakens. The silence and darkness that until recently filled its corridors and galleries are rapidly dissipating, giving way to the bright light of torches, loud voices, the clatter of feet and the clang of weapons.
{cps=50}For a while you manage to stay ahead of your pursuers, but in one of the corridors, literally a couple of turns before the exit, you are overtaken.
{cps=50}When they pounce on you, chaos unfolds, in which it turns out to be every man for himself. Luckily for you, Bartholomew manages to knock the torch out of the hands of one of the guards, diverting attention to himself and plunging the room into saving darkness.
{cps=50}Sensing danger, the guards grab their swords, clearly intending to take you dead, not alive. Most of them were occupied by your comrades, and only one of the pursuers focused on you, blocking the path to the exit.
{cps=50}Thanks to the darkness and the surrounding confusion, you manage to dodge several of the awkward sword blows that he tries to reach you with, and taking advantage of his oversight, you run with all your might to the way out, leaving the fight behind.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}Carrying off your feet at the speed of a horse gallop, you manage to get out, and make your way back to the camp in a roundabout way.
{cps=50}Backing away from his blows, you stumble, and the blade of the sword reaches you, leaving a shallow but painful wound.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check failed!]
{cps=50}Looking at the outlines of the Eastern Tower, blackening in the distance, you think of various options in your mind.
{cps=50}You can try to sneak into the tower. Such a mission is virtually impossible and the risk will be not just high, but very high.
{cps=50}Needless to say, you may pay for any, even the slightest mistake with your own life.
{cps=50}The second option that comes to your mind is to enter the tower under the guise of one of the castle garrison soldiers. If you can guess the time and act under cover of night, then there will definitely be chances to slip in.
{cps=50}However, in order for such a scheme to work, you need at least some equipment - so that in the dark you can pass off as a full-fledged soldier.
{cps=50}Without a helmet and armor - even the most bad ones - such a scheme will never work.
{cps=50}Or you can try to bribe one of the guards.
{cps=50}Bartholomew and his buddies had quite a low opinion of the guards, and it may well be that for a handful of ringing coins, one of them would agree to lower their vigilance for a while.
{cps=50}Despite the advice of the sergeant, who urged not to skimp on money when it comes to the danger to your own life, you decide on a suicidal attempt to enter the tower.
{cps=50}Despite having significantly more attractive ideas, you decide on a suicidal attempt to break into the tower.
{cps=50}At first, luck seems to be smiling at you. Sneaking into the walls of the castle, you wait for the night in a secluded place. After waiting for the right moment during the changing of the guard, you make your way into the Eastern Tower.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}However, inside you face the first problem. Not being familiar with the inner structure of the tower, you have very little idea of where exactly the prisoners can be kept.
{cps=50}All that is left is to trust your guts.
{cps=50}You decide to start from the upper floors.
{cps=50}You try to make as little noise as possible, as you methodically look through room after room...
{cps=50}However, the unexpected loud creaking sound that one of the doors makes under your pressure, gives you off.
{cps=50}You decide to start from the middle floors.
{cps=50}After thinking for a minute, you decide that the prisoners will most likely be kept somewhere in the basements and decide to start your search from the lower floors.
{cps=50}Moving in the shadows and trying not to make any noise, you slowly look through the basements and, after a while, stumble upon holding cells.
{cps=50}They all turn out to be empty ...
{cps=50}Except for the last one, where you find Bartholomew. Badly beaten, but still alive.
{cps=50}With the help of a wooden bench found nearby, you manage to remove the bars from the hinges and release Bartholomew to freedom.
{cps=50}Praying to God that no one heard the noise you just made, you carefully begin to get out.
{cps=50}But things are not going well for you. Roughed up by the guards, Bartholomew barely moves his feet and with every step he takes, it becomes more obvious to you that he most likely will not get back.
{cps=50}Using your impressive physical strength, you prop your friend onto yourself, helping him to walk.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Strength check passed!]
{cps=50}Providence continues to be on your side and, in spite of everything, the way out goes just as well.
{cps=50}You are able to hide in the shadows from those few guards who you come across on the way. And very soon you safely get out of the tower.
{cps=50}Back at the camp, Bartholomew thanks you for his release in every way possible and promises to never forget what you did for him.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!{vspace=5}Bartholomew became your friend.
{cps=50}You are trying to carry him on yourself, but your strength is clearly not enough. After a few steps of dragging Bartholomew on your shoulders, you fall under his weight.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Strength check failed!]
{cps=50}And what is even worse is that your fall occurs right under the noses of several guards who immediately rush towards you.
{cps=50}Realizing the hopelessness of the situation, Bartholomew asks you to leave him, saying that you have already done everything in your power.
{cps=50}You have no choice but to comply and, leaving Bartholomew to the mercy of fate, save yourself.
{cps=50}Running through the bushes back to the camp, clenching your teeth in frustration, you are sadly forced to admit that the plan to free your comrade has clearly failed.
{cps=50}Your adventure, however, ends even before it begins - the guards notice you as you approach the tower and you have to hastily flee.
{cps=50}After a good deal of thought, you decide to take advantage of the fact that you have already managed to get some equipment, and try to fool guards passing as one of their own in the dark.
{cps=50}The strategy you have chosen turns out to be surprisingly successful. Pulling your helmet down to your nose and hiding your face behind the high collar of your jacket, you manage to successfully infiltrate the Eastern Tower under the guise of one of the garrison soldiers.
{cps=50}Several times other guards address you with something, but you manage to evade conversations, muttering something inaudible in response.
{cps=50}A short search leads you to the basement, where you find numerous holding cells.
{color=#A9A9A9}You don't have enough money even for the smallest bribe!
{cps=50}Remembering the words of the sergeant, who urged not to skimp on gold when it comes to matters of survival, you decide to risk not your life, but your purse.
{cps=50}You manage to establish contact with one of the guards, who does not seem to mind letting you in at night for a certain amount of money.
{cps=50}But the guard does not hurry to name the exact price, giving you the opportunity to offer first.
{cps=50}The amount you offered instantly turns the face of the guard sour, and he suggests you not to waste his time, adding that all he can do for 10 florins is to spit in your face.
{cps=50}The amount you offer clearly does not cause much delight in the guard, but it at least makes him think.
{cps=50}After a couple of minutes of reflection, he nevertheless agrees to help you but emphasizes that his participation will be limited only to an assistance in getting inside the tower, and everything else is your own business.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Gold decreased by 20!
{cps=50}He also adds that from the moment you get inside, you will become an enemy. He will give you a head start of a few minutes, but then, if he notices you, he will immediately raise the alarm.
{cps=50}At night, at the agreed time, the guard lets you into the tower through a secret passage, then leaves you to yourself and you have no choice but to wander along the dark corridors alone.
{cps=50}Your generous, without an exaggeration, offer, makes him smile and he immediately agrees to assist you not only in getting inside the Eastern Tower but also in the rescue of your comrade.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Gold decreased by 50!
{cps=50}At night, at the agreed time, the guard lets you into the tower through a secret passage and takes you to the basements. There, in one of the cells, you find Bartholomew, who is badly beaten, but still alive.
{cps=50}He can hardly stand on his feet, but together you are able to get him to the exit.
{cps=50}On the way, you encounter patrols several times, however, the guard you bought knows their routes well and helps to avoid meeting them.
{cps=50}The whole maneuver goes like clockwork, and soon you first find yourself behind the fortress walls, and then in the camp.
{cps=50}The noise instantly attracts the attention of the guards, and you have only a few moments to make a decision.
{cps=50}In the room behind the creaky door, there is a small window without bars, where, with a bit of luck, a person can squeeze through.
{cps=50}After everything that has already happened today, you decide to stay true to yourself to the end and make another crazy decision - to jump out of the window.
{cps=50}Fate smiles at you once again and the landing is softened by a large wagon full of hay that accidentally found itself right under the window.
{cps=50}However, judging by the sharp pain piercing your leg, it was not possible to do without at least some consequences.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[Leg broken!]
{cps=50}But every cloud has a silver lining. Your unwillingness to join a colleague sitting in a dungeon acts quite as well as the healthy leg.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of the confusion of the guards, you manage to waddle away.
{cps=50}Running through the bushes back to the camp, clenching your teeth in pain, you are sadly forced to admit that the plan to free your comrade has clearly failed.
{cps=50}The best idea that comes to your mind is to fight your way out.
{cps=50}The guards, who still do not fully understand what is happening, are not ready to face you and you manage to overpower the first few opponents that came your way.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Weapon skill check passed!
{cps=50}Without wasting any time, you get to the lower floors, and taking advantage of the confusion of enemies, get out of the tower.
{cps=50}The guards who still do not fully understand what is happening are not ready to face you, and you manage to overpower the first few opponents that came your way.
{cps=50}However, their advantage in numbers makes itself felt, and during a short but intense exchange of blows, one of the guards inflicts a serious wound to your arm.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[Weapon skill check failed!]{vspace=5}[Arm muscles cut!]
{cps=50}Despite the injury, you do not waste time, and, taking advantage of the confusion of the enemies, you manage to first get to the lower floors, and then get out.
{cps=50}However, what little you managed to equip is clearly not enough to pass for one of the guards and they catch on faster than you are able to get to the tower, forcing you to flee.
{cps=50}Any soldier knows very well, that one should always stay away from the authorities. And now you fully realize the truth of these words: having accidentally caught the earl's eye on one of the days, you immediately get called to him to receive a 'responsible task'.
{cps=50}The earl says he is currently actively working on plans to infiltrate the besieged city, but the shortage of good alcohol in the camp is a serious threat to his strategic genius.
{cps=50}When you timidly try to note that the army stocks are full of wine and ale, the earl immediately silences you, stating that he is not going to drink this swill and he needs something of a substantially higher quality.
{cps=50}A good place to look for this 'something', in his opinion, would be the farmsteads of the local nobility that have not yet been plundered. There, in the cellars, is supposed to be a supply of excellent wine.
{cps=50}The whole thing, of course, should be done as quietly as possible and without attracting too much attention...
{cps=50}You are not enthusiastic about this assignment, but business is business, and now you hardly will be able to get out of the task at hand.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - In Vino Veritas.
{cps=50}The earl's order leads you to the Estate de Lambert - one of the few places around Cambrai that is definitely not threatened by marauders and foragers.
{cps=50}The estate is a group of fortified buildings in the rolling hills to the northwest of the city. Despite the fact that it clearly is not a full-fledged castle, the estate still looks very solid - for the most part thanks to the imposing moat surrounding it, as well as short but thick walls.
{cps=50}At the entrance to the drawbridge you are stopped by the crossbowmen standing on the wall, asking what the hell you need here.
{cps=50}Yeah, what do you actually want here... The question kind of catches you by surprise.
{cps=50}Trying your best to be as convincing as possible, you declare that you have arrived here on a confidential matter personally commissioned by His Excellency Earl of Northampton, the first of the Lords of Central England.
{cps=50}However, judging by the sour faces of the crossbowmen, their knowledge of the hierarchy of the English nobility is rather poor and they clearly do not fully understand the significance of your mission.
{cps=50}Seeing that the matter is obviously reaching a dead end, you try to explain in a nutshell, who exactly is the earl and why he (and therefore you) is a very important person, demanding a lot of respect.
{cps=50}This time your words had a greater effect and, judging by the somewhat perked up faces of the guards, they begin to be imbued with some kind of respect for your now common good friend earl.
{cps=50}... so much so, that one of the crossbowmen unexpectedly offers to make the earl a small gift from the de Lambert family, as well as personally from himself... {w} A gift, in the form of a crossbow bolt between the eyes. The guard states that he is ready to personally present it to the earl if he decides to come here.
{cps=50}Or, what is even more convenient, - he continues, - you, as a full-fledged confidant of such an important person, should be able to pass him the gift.
{cps=50}With these words, the guard begins to load the crossbow.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}......{w}{vspace=5}...{w}{vspace=5}Belatedly realizing that you are very much in trouble, you try to dissuade him from giving you 'the gift', but the hospitable Frenchman clearly insists.
{cps=50}The moment the guard picks up the crossbow and aims it at you, someone calls him off.{w} A few seconds later, a young girl appears on the wall next to the crossbowmen, rudely reprimanding them for their arbitrariness.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check passed!]
{cps=50}Having carefully studied the unexpected guest, she gives the order to let you in...
{cps=50}The moment he picks up the crossbow and aims it at you, you still partly hope that the situation will somehow be resolved.
{cps=50}But that's not what happens.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]
{cps=50}The whistle of a crossbow bowstring cuts through the air, and before you can understand anything, you are already on the ground, and a sharp pain fills your chest.
{cps=50}Having come to your senses a little, you realize that, as if by a miracle, you were saved by your armor - a light crossbow bolt could not pierce it; your internal organs are intact, but you obviously got a heavy bruise.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}However you are far from being safe yet, as looking up, you notice that the guard is loading a second bolt into the crossbow.
{cps=50}Sprawled in the road dust, you have nowhere to run and the second shot has a very real chance of becoming fatal.
{cps=50}However, you end up quite lucky, as someone calls off the guard.{w} A few seconds later, a young girl appears on the wall next to the crossbowmen, rudely reprimanding them for their arbitrariness.
{cps=50}{cps=50}Carefully inspecting the unexpected guest (laying on the side of the road), she gives the order to help you and immediately lets you through the gate...
{cps=50}Having come to your senses a little, you realize that, as if by a miracle, you were saved by the shooter's poor accuracy - the bolt only lightly hit you, passing close to the body and leaving a shallow wound, albeit profusely bleeding.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Bloodloss!
{cps=50}However you are far from being safe yet as looking up, you notice that the guard is loading a second bolt into the crossbow.
{cps=50}Carefully inspecting the unexpected guest (laying on the side of the road), she gives the order to help you and immediately lets you through the gate...
{cps=50}This war was started by kings and lords. I am just a soldier and only follow the orders.
{cps=50}However, duty is duty. My honor obliges me to take part in my overlord's campaign and I will have to shed blood to avoid disgrace.
{cps=50}Even against my will...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) improved by 5!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}I don’t understand what you mean - so far I have been greeted quite warmly. Especially by girls.
{cps=50}I don’t know why your man was so angry with me... Although, perhaps, I have already met his wife or sister.
{cps=50}But they didn’t shoot. Hence the good mood. By the way, thank you for your help - your appearance was very timely. But, for the sake of truth, I must say that I already had everything under control.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Trying to make an impression, you try to speak as pompously and floridly as possible, listing the earl's titles and regalia for a long time, as well as his place in the hierarchy of Lords of Central England and the royal army.
{cps=50}However, your interlocutor, as well as her crossbowmen a few moments ago, is not impressed at all, and soon she bluntly interrupts you...
{cps=50}So, as I said, I'm here on a very serious matter.
{cps=50}My boss... How can I put it... He is going through an acute existential crisis, and only a couple of bottles of excellent wine can help him to cope with it...
{cps=50}...？
{cps=50}I promise.
{cps=50}I will do everything in my power to protect them.{w} And if it comes to it, I will give my life.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - The Promise.
{cps=50}I cannot promise you that.
{cps=50}War is unpredictable and cruel. I cannot ensure even my own safety, let alone that of others. All the more so about those who could potentially find themselves on the other side of the barricades.
{cps=50}I have no craving for taking other people's lives, but I'm not a saint either. Therefore, I am not able to make such promises. Sorry.
{cps=50}Your return to camp is uneventful.
{cps=50}Having failed to get wine as per the earl's assignment, you have greatly lost your credibility in his eyes.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}According to the king's plan, the success of the upcoming assault will be ensured by several dozen different siege machines - trebuchets, catapults, siege towers and battering rams.
{cps=50}Their construction, obviously, requires not only time, but also a large amount of effort, and therefore many soldiers are involved in this work every day.
{cps=50}This fate does not pass by you either.
{cps=50}For several days in a row, you do tedious and hard rough work.
{cps=50}Despite all attempts to conscientiously fulfill your duties, you lack physical strength and struggle with the exhausting work.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Strength check failed!]
{cps=50}Weakness in the army is quite despised by everyone, and soon you begin to notice the contemptuous looks of other soldiers. This display of weakness is clearly not good for your reputation.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}You scrupulously carry out your duties, even despite the difficulties, but throughout the entire working time you think that the week before the assault could be spent on much more useful and important things than dragging logs and stones.

{cps=50}One day a Venetian merchant appears in the English camp passing by, traveling from Italy to the lands of the German princes.
{cps=50}A wealthy merchant instantly ends up in Bartholomew's field of vision, who quickly makes inquiries about him, finding out, among other things, that the merchant is a big lover of gambling.
{cps=50}At the same time, however, he is very cunning and is familiar with most of the tricks that cheaters usually use, and because of it, it would seem that it would not be possible to make easy money on him.
{cps=50}Bartholomew, however, being no slouch in everything that concerns gambling, is determined to try his luck and has already scheduled the game with the Venetian.
{cps=50}According to Bartholomew, he is absolutely confident that he will be able to outplay the merchant as soon as he sees through his strategy. However, this may not work out the first time...
{cps=50}This means that he will need a hefty sum in order to 'open up' the opponent. Given the Venetian's gambling addiction, you can be sure that he will definitely not leave the table until he fishes the last coin from his opponent's pockets or until he empties his own purse.
{cps=50}According to Bartholomew, you can earn a lot of money that way, although you have to find good capital to spend on the game. But at the same time, success will be doubly guaranteed if you manage to get some lucky dice...
{cps=50}Addressing you as a friend, he asks you to help him raise money and promises to generously share the booty in proportion to your investment.
{cps=50}Considering that the game is scheduled for the next evening, you don't have much time...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [hustler.name].
{cps=50}At the appointed hour, Bartholomew appears with a smile from ear to ear and a long story about how he outplayed the Venetian in a difficult game.
{cps=50}With gratitude, he gives you your share of the winnings.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+[hustler.timed_out] Florins!
{cps=50}At the appointed hour, Bartholomew appears with a sullen expression on his face and a long story about how he almost beat the Venetian several times, but in the end he was left with nothing.

{cps=50}The excitement of the unexpected earnings, however, is a little shaded by the realization that it was achieved thanks to the use of lucky dice, which, in many people's eyes, equals to cheating.
{cps=50}As if echoing your thoughts, Bartholomew, saying goodbye, says that the Venetian also suspected something was wrong with the dice, but he managed to slip away before the merchant caused a serious stir.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!
{cps=50}New carts and caravans with all kinds of provisions and equipment arrive at the siege camp every day. In order to manage unloading and sorting out what was brought to warehouses, the quartermasters, overwhelmed with worries, have to take one of the ordinary soldiers, who are not engaged in other work, to their aid.
{cps=50}One day they come across you, too. You are sent to sort out stocks at one of the food and equipment warehouses.
{cps=50}The work is not too hard, but rather monotonous, and the quartermaster in charge of the warehouse now and then leaves for all sorts of business, leaving you to yourself.
{cps=50}Poking around in countless bags and boxes, you inevitably notice that much of the contents could well be neatly pocketed and no one would even notice.
{cps=50}And the fact that the warehouse, packed to capacity with all kinds of good, is intended to supply the knights and their entourage, while you and your comrades of not such a noble origin are cared for not even half as much, only adds weight to your idea.
{cps=50}Ordinary soldiers from your entourage would be more than grateful if, so to speak, for a short while, they would be invited to visit...
{cps=50}However, dark deeds love silence, and if you can grab a couple of things for yourself relatively safely, then a large-scale theft has a high chance of being noticed and getting you severely punished.
{cps=50}After giving it some thought, you decide that the knights (some of whom are already having difficulty climbing up on their horses due to excess weight) will not become impoverished if you pocket a couple of things.
{cps=50}After waiting for the quartermaster to once again leave for some urgent business, you go on a hunt.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check passed!]

{cps=50}Despite all your threats and calls to behave as quietly as possible, the militias who have got their hands on the knightly reserves are swarming the warehouse with such zeal that it literally shakes.
{cps=50}To the accompaniment of jokes and giggles, valuables migrate from boxes and bales to the pockets of the royal infantry; bottles of wine and ale are uncorked and emptied on the spot and packs of ham are covered with bites from many sets of teeth.
{cps=50}Feeling like an unlucky owner trying to protect his house from the invasion of uninvited guests, you run back and forth between your comrades, trying to persuade, convince or force them to behave quieter, eat less and steal more modestly.
{cps=50}As a result, when the happy soldiers finally go away, you are left in the middle of a literally half-plundered warehouse, and only with very great effort do you manage to bring it into some semblance of order before the quartermaster gets back.
{cps=50}When, by some miracle, he does not notice the loss of a good half of the contents of the warehouse, you feel like the luckiest person in the camp.

{cps=50}One day you are unexpectedly called by a sergeant who asks you to help him with one important matter.
{cps=50}You need to deliver water to one of the distant outposts covering the western part of the city.
{cps=50}This direction is considered not particularly promising in terms of siege, moreover, there are no large gates. And therefore, there is only one relatively small detachment.
{cps=50}The problem, however, is that in the past few days, the French made several sorties in that direction and, among other things, attacked one of the couriers delivering messages from the detachment.
{cps=50}All this, apparently, is just a diversionary maneuver and to transfer large forces to the western side of the city means to follow the French lead, weakening more promising directions.
{cps=50}Thus, the western detachment will not get reinforcements, however, it is still necessary to supply it and also maintain contact with it. Therefore, a reliable person is needed who can be assigned the role of a courier for a short time.
{cps=50}Your task is to safely get to the western outpost, give them a letter with instructions from the command, as well as a load of drinking water.
{cps=50}The sergeant gives you the letter and tells you to come to him to get water later when you are ready. The luggage may turn out to be quite bulky, so it would be handy to pick up some kind of bag. However, the sergeant himself can give it to you.
{cps=50}The sergeant also warns you that the road may not be the safest. However, according to him, the surrounding area is poorly, but still patrolled, and therefore, in the event of an attack by the French, you just need to hold on until help appears.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - Waterboy.
{cps=50}Once at the western outpost, you give its chief a letter with instructions from the command. The letter, however, is of little interest to anyone, and with much greater impatience he and his people await the promised drinking water.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}No canteens handed over.
{cps=50}In response to their disgruntled questions as to where the hell is the water they were promised - you evasively blame everything on the French attack in the forest, because of which the cargo was lost.
{cps=50}But your story clearly leaves soldiers unimpressed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 25!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}1 canteen handed over.
{cps=50}But your story clearly leaves soldiers unimpressed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}2 canteens handed over.
{cps=50}But your story clearly leaves soldiers unimpressed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}3 canteens handed over.
{cps=50}When you pass them the flasks, the clearly thirsty soldiers become very animated and seemingly very glad to see you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) improved by 15!
{cps=50}Returning back with one of the cavalry detachments, you report to the sergeant on the completion of the task.
{cps=50}Hearing about the French attack, the first thing he wonders about is the safety of the letter. After making sure it's okay, he praises you and promises to put in a word with the earl.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) improved by 5!{vspace=5}+50 Florins!
{cps=50}Returning back with one of the cavalry detachments, you report to the sergeant about what happened.
{cps=50}Hearing about the French attack, the first thing he wonders about is the safety of the letter. Upon learning that it was lost, he immediately darkens and says that you both should expect a serious punishment from the command for such foolery.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}The sergeant patiently waits until you finally decide to fulfill the task of delivering the letter and water to the western outpost, but gives up and sends another person there in despair.
{cps=50}He tells you that through your slowness you have greatly let him and the earl down.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Ah, [name]! Glad to see you in one piece!
{cps=50}Yes, it’s sad that even with such brave men as you, luck still doesn't turn to face us, and we continue to hang out under these damn walls...
{cps=50}I think my increased respect for you will be an excellent reward!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) improved by 15!
{cps=50}Well, thanks for nothing, I guess.
{cps=50}Thank you for the honor, but back then, under the walls of the city, you promised money as a reward...
{cps=50}Don't talk nonsense, son! I remember very well what I said.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 2!
{cps=50}I promised double loot to whoever gets on the wall first. However, if my memory serves me, the city has not yet been captured and we have not taken any loot.
{cps=50}I understand that arithmetic is a difficult concept for a yokel like you, so I'm afraid you'll have to take my word for it.
{cps=50}Doubled nothing is still nothing, smart-ass. Therefore - here you go, dig in. This is all yours.
{cps=50}However, have it your way. You have really shown valor; I promised a reward out of my pocket and I keep my word. Here.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+50 Florins!
{cps=50}Arriving on the orders of the earl, you find him in the company of the prince, surrounded by several uncorked bottles of the wine you obtained earlier.
{cps=50}When you appear, the conversation between them dies down, and both begin to inspect you with interest.
{cps=50}Hmm...
{cps=50}Yeah, no, I see the semblance.
{cps=50}The mug, of course, is just a little thuggish... But on the whole, it looks quite... Quite...
{cps=50}Virtuous?
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}What's the matter?
{cps=50}Do you think he can handle it?
{cps=50}He seems to have a head on his shoulders, this boy. And even with some semblance of wrinkles in it - certainly better than most smooth-brained lads here.
{cps=50}If we need a quick-witted person who is at the same time quite dispos... I mean, who can also be entrusted with responsible business - then he is clearly the best candidate.
{cps=50}So be it. Listen here, boy.
{cps=50}As you probably already understood, we are thoroughly stuck under Cambrai, although according to the plan, we should have been deep in France by this time.
{cps=50}This bloody little town has become a bone in the King's throat. A bone that could well ruin the whole war venture.
{cps=50}The next assault will soon take place and it should be decisive. In order not to screw it up again, we need to get as much information as possible about the state of affairs in the city itself...
{cps=50}How big are the losses of the French? In what state are their fortifications? Has their morale fallen? Are there enough provisions? And so on. Do you understand?
{cps=50}I understand. But what have I got to do with it?
{cps=50}We need eyes and ears in the city. And you are the right fit. Tell him.
{cps=50}You have to sneak into the city, boy, and scout out the situation there. You don't have to worry - there will be almost no danger.  It's a real deal...
{cps=50}We thought it all over: you will enter the city under the guise of a monk who allegedly escaped from one of the nearby abbeys, which were so conveniently plundered by the mercenaries of Lord Canterbury.
{cps=50}There will be no risk! Put on some rags, put on a cross...
{cps=50}Make your way through the unsuspecting guards into the city, scout the situation there...
{cps=50}...and then dash back like a hog! Those schmoes won't know what hit them.
{cps=50}A great plan.
{cps=50}And, most importantly, reliable, like the Roman roads.
{cps=50}I think this is a great plan.
{cps=50}Ha! You bet! Look, after all, even if you are killed (the likelihood of which, of course, is present), then it will be quite possible to assume that you died as a man of God. And at the Last Judgment, this will obviously count.
{cps=50}Exactly. No downsides.
{cps=50}Your confidence makes me happy. Once again I realize that I was not mistaken in you, boy.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) improved by 3!
{cps=50}Do not take my words for insolence, but this...
{cps=50}This is...
{cps=50}An awful plan!
{cps=50}Things will go south for sure, I am not even talking about the fact that even if I make my way into the city, getting out of there may be an even more difficult task!
{cps=50}Don't talk nonsense! This plan is excellent and the only thing that can ruin it is your nagging.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 3!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Unexpectedly, the prince removes a dagger from his belt and with a sharp blow plunges it into the wooden table.
{cps=50}This is for you. Obviously, you cannot sneak a sword or an axe into the city, but a knife will do.
{cps=50}And as the old saying goes, 'No written law is stronger than cold steel.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Holding out your hand to take the dagger, you cannot help but think that a weapon is the last thing you need for such a mission.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [monk.name].
{cps=50}By order of the prince, some of the units blocking the city briefly leave their positions, opening a corridor for infiltration into Cambrai.
{cps=50}You are among the many refugees from the surrounding abbeys who are seeking refuge in the city.
{cps=50}Like other refugees, you fall under the scrutiny of the guards at the entrance to the city. Aware of the possibility of English spies entering the city, they carefully examine your appearance...
{cps=50}Almost immediately, they notice the gorget, which blows your cover, forcing you to flee through the gates that have not yet closed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check failed!]
{cps=50}Almost immediately, they notice the bracers, which blow your cover, forcing you to flee through the gates that have not yet closed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check failed!]
{cps=50}Almost immediately, they notice the crossbow reloading device, which blows your cover, forcing you to flee through the gates that have not yet closed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check failed!]
{cps=50}At first, everything seems to be going well, however, when you pass one of the guards, he notices a pagan amulet on you - a rather strange accessory for an inhabitant of a Catholic abbey.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check failed!]
{cps=50}This instantly destroys your cover, forcing you to flee through the gates that have not yet closed.
{cps=50}With a huge bag on your back and a cross around your neck, you do not at all stand out from the inhabitants of the nearby abbeys who arrived in Cambrai. And without attracting the attention of the guards, you successfully infiltrate the city.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket|Luck check passed!]
However, looking closer, you notice that one of the guards at the entrance to the city quietly suggests each of the refugees to 'make a donation' to the defenders of Cambrai. And those who obediently fork out a coin or two are allowed into the city without any problems. But to those who refuse, the guards clearly show increased interest.
Fortunately for you, you have a weighty coin of good value in your pocket. It should definitely be enough for the guards to lose interest in you.
{cps=50}You decide to pay and, having reached the soldier, you nod affirmatively in response to his offer and give him the coin.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check passed!]
{cps=50}Appraising the coin with a respectful look, the guard lets you into the city without any questions.
{cps=50}You decide not to spend the coin, hoping that you will be able to get into the city anyway.
{cps=50}Thinking about this, you notice the approach of a group of guards.
{cps=50}With a huge bag on your back and a lute on your neck, you don't look much like an inhabitant of one of the surrounding abbeys.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check indecisive!]
{cps=50}You introduce yourself to suspicious guards as a wandering musician, who fled the English marauders and tagged along with the monks.
{cps=50}Still suspicious guards ask you to play a song to prove that you really are a musician.
{cps=50}{i}I do hate to play the rake, but alas, I must;{vspace=5}As I grow, I spy my visage from within the dust, knave.{vspace=5}I'm the kind of brigand all the youths want to be like{vspace=5}Yet I beg on my knees saying prayers in the candlelight.
{cps=50}{i}But I'm that bad type{vspace=5}Make thyne mamma sad type{vspace=5}Make thyne betrothed mad tight{vspace=5}Might seduce thyne dad type{vspace=15}I'm the bad guy, duh.
{cps=50}Bopping, guards let you into the city.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket|Luck check passed!]
{cps=50}The moment you finish singing the last words of the song, one of the guards hits you in the face, while others call for help and try to grab you. All that remains for you is to flee through the gates that have not yet closed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]
{cps=50}Having a very vague idea of how to play the lute, you try to talk your way out, claiming that your voice is so charming and captivating, that upon hearing it the defenders of the city can involuntarily relax and lose their vigilance, which cannot be allowed, given the proximity of the English.
{cps=50}The guards are not convinced by these arguments, and they say that, on the contrary, they will only be happy to finally listen to a couple of good songs.
{cps=50}In a last-ditch attempt to talk your way out, you suddenly recall that you won't be able to play since the lute got wet after the recent rain and had not yet time to dry out. And therefore, it won't produce any decent sound.
{cps=50}Your lies sound convincing, and the guards, with regret that they cannot listen to your beautiful singing, let you into the city.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket|Luck check passed!]
{cps=50}Your lies do not sound very convincing - especially since the last rain was a week and a half ago. Sensing that something is wrong, the guards immediately try to grab you, forcing you to flee through the gates that have not yet closed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]
{cps=50}With a huge bag on your back and a miserable expression on your face, you do not at all stand out from the inhabitants of the nearby abbeys who arrived in Cambrai. And without attracting the attention of the guards, you successfully infiltrate the city.
{cps=50}At first, everything seems to be going well, however, when you pass one of the guards, you catch his eye and he clearly does not like something about you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check indecisive!]{vspace=5}[[Luck check failed!]
{cps=50}Apparently feeling that something here smells fishy, he takes you aside for a more detailed examination and interrogation.
{cps=50}With a miserable expression on your face and a cross around your neck, you do not at all stand out from the inhabitants of the nearby abbeys who arrived in Cambrai. And without attracting the attention of the guards, you successfully infiltrate the city.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket|Luck check passed!]

{cps=50}At first, everything seems to be going well, however, when you pass one of the guards, you catch his eye and he clearly does not like something about you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check indecisive!]
{cps=50}You don't even have a cross on you, so the guards seriously question your cover story about an escape from an abbey.
{cps=50}Almost immediately, while examining your belongings, the guards find poison that casts serious doubt on your cover story about an escape from an abbey.
{cps=50}The guards begin to question you about the details of your escape from an abbey, but each answer you give seems to make them more and more suspicious.
{cps=50}Realizing that your cover is falling apart, you decide to take a risky step and offer to pay the guards so they let you into the city with no questions asked.
{cps=50}After thinking for a minute, the French ask you for 45 Florins.
{cps=50}As soon as the coins travel from your pocket into the pocket of one of the guards, all suspicions are immediately removed. After making you swear that you are not a spy, you are let into the city.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}-45 Florins!
{cps=50}You are not willing to part with such a sum of money, and therefore you decide to abort the operation... and run away.
{cps=50}You don’t have that kind of money, and therefore you have to abort the operation... and run away.
{cps=50}Several arrows are shot behind you, however, due to the confusion in the crowd of refugees, the French do not have time to organize a full-fledged pursuit.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check passed!]
{cps=50}However, you fail to escape and fall into the hands of the guards.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]
{cps=50}The next few days you spend behind bars in a cold cell, and this definitely affects your health.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality decreased by 1!
{cps=50}But luckily for you, you are soon exchanged for a few French prisoners captured by the earl's men.
{cps=50}Seeing that a bottle of alcohol found among your belongings has got the attention of the guards, you offer them to take it for themselves in exchange for a pass to the city.
{cps=50}Your plan worked. The guards make you swear that you are not a spy and let you into the city.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check passed!]{vspace=5}Trinket lost!
{cps=50}However, your plan failed, since upon reflection, the guards reasonably decide that they can take it anyway, and just kick you out of the city for your suspicious appearance.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]{vspace=5}Trinket lost!
{cps=50}Realizing that there is no chance of successfully getting into the city, you run away.
{cps=50}Things are going quite well for you in the city. Looking around, you take notice of several sections of the defensive structures that were damaged the most during the previous assaults, and are now very vulnerable.
{cps=50}In addition, under the guise of a monk, you manage to have a few words with a dozen residents and soldiers, all of whom talked about their, albeit not disastrous, but very difficult situation under the siege.
{cps=50}A problem appears in the form of an impudent Flemish knight who accidentally bumps into you in some half-empty alley. He straight away declares that he does not like your mug.
{cps=50}Despite the knight's accusations, you remain true to your legend and continue to portray a harmless monk... And it works.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check passed!]
{cps=50}Having interrogated you a little bit more, the Fleming leaves you alone, but promises that he will not let you out of his sight.
{cps=50}Despite the knight's accusations, you remain true to your legend and continue to portray a harmless monk... But it doesn't work.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check failed!]
{cps=50}The Fleming who realized that you are a spy, hands you over to the guards.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of the place's seclusion, you take out a lute hidden in your bosom and smash it right on the head of the overly vigilant knight. Then you carefully hide his limp body among barrels and boxes.
{cps=50}Removing this obstacle from the path, you go back to the task.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of the place's seclusion, you take out a bottle of ale hidden in your bosom and smash it right on the head of the overly vigilant knight. Then you carefully hide his limp body among barrels and boxes.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of the place's seclusion, you take out a bottle of wine hidden in your bosom and smash it right on the head of the overly vigilant knight. Then you carefully hide his limp body among barrels and boxes.
{cps=50}Taking advantage of the place's seclusion, you thrust a dagger under the rib of an overly vigilant knight, and then carefully hide his lifeless body among barrels and boxes.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 4!
{cps=50}Not the most noble deed, but desperate times, as you know, call for desperate measures.
{cps=50}After collecting all the necessary information and waiting for the night, you plan your return back to the camp.
{cps=50}Knowing the strong and weak points of the fortifications, you find a place where, under cover of darkness, you can relatively safely get out of the city.
{cps=50}The night guard post located nearby becomes an unexpected obstacle on your way out...
{cps=50}Fate is on your side and you safely reach the camp.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check passed!]
{cps=50}But fate is not on your side and, when you try to escape, you get captured by the guards.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]
{cps=50}Seizing a convenient moment when the guards are distracted by their own affairs, you run for your life. Thanks to the excellent shoes, you are able to gain a decent speed and easily cross the numerous ravines along the way, leaving your pursuers far behind and safely returning to camp.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check passed!]
{cps=50}You fish out the coin, that was so conveniently lying around in your pocket, and throw it on the opposite side of the street. The clinking sound it made successfully distracts the guards. While the alarmed French are busy looking for the source of the noise, you safely get out of the city and return to the camp.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check passed!]
{cps=50}You notice that the French regularly refill their flasks from a large barrel of water and mix the contents of the bottle of poison into it.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check passed!]{vspace=5}Virtue decreased by 10!
{cps=50}Half an hour later, the guards fall to the ground, after which you safely get out of Cambrai and then reach the camp.
{cps=50}The unsuccessful outcome of the whole maneuver clearly upsets the prince and the earl, and they state that they expected much more from you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 3!
{cps=50}However, on reflection, both agree that there were some certain flaws in the plan.
{cps=50}Despite the partial failure of the operation, you still managed to get a certain amount of information, for which you receive gratitude from the command.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) improved by 6!{vspace=5}+30 Florins!
{cps=50}However, the limited amount of information, as well as the unsuccessful outcome of the whole maneuver, clearly upset the prince and the earl and they state that they expected much more from you.
{cps=50}The earl and the prince take your success for granted, attributing it entirely to the ingenuity of their plan.
{cps=50}However, you also get a certain praise.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) improved by 10!{vspace=5}+55 Florins!
{cps=50}You dragged on with the preparations too much and failed to fulfill the order of the earl and the prince to infiltrate the city under the guise of a monk in time, which seriously disappointed both of them.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 20!
{cps=50}Shortly after the start of the siege, the camp starts to experience small supply disruptions.{w} As you find out, the cause is in the wagons coming from Dunkirk that got stuck due to the roads being washed out by the rain.
{cps=50}The King doesn't want to risk the morale and combat effectiveness of the army, and gives the order to outfit detachments of foragers, that will go to the surrounding settlements to collect food.
{cps=50}Having distinguished yourself during the recent battles in Cambrai and being already acquainted with the earl, you are placed in charge of one of these small detachments.
{cps=50}Thanks to your authority among the soldiers, you are put at the head of one of these small detachments.
{cps=50}The sergeant gives you a map of the area, on which several nearby villages are marked - places, that you have to visit.
{cps=50}While instructing you, the sergeant urges you not to show excessive aggression towards the local residents, but also not to babysit them either - the soldiers need something to eat and the peasants will have to share, whether they want to or not.
{cps=50}Also, according to him, you should always keep your ears open when communicating with the villagers. It is not for nothing that an old English proverb says - 'In the woods there are fancy-ass pheasants, in the mud huts there are dirty-ass peasants'...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [forager.name].
{cps=50}After about a two-hour journey, you reach a settlement called Barfleur, located west of Cambrai.
{cps=50}The village looks frankly poor and one of your companions immediately says that peasants here probably don't have anything even for themselves.
{cps=50}The peasants you come across on the way look tattered and intimidated and do not at all resemble wealthy people you could take something from.
{cps=50}Taking a good look around, you find the village headman, whose words only confirm your observations - there is nothing to take in Barfleur because the locals themselves can hardly make ends meet.
{cps=50}Despite the protests and pleas of the headman, as well as of the other villagers, you, one after another, ravage all the village houses and sheds, stuffing bales with food.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 10!
{cps=50}You leave the village to the accompaniment of the crying and howling of dozens of women and children. One of the soldiers riding next to you mutters in an undertone that, although orders are orders, you did not act like a Christian.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 2!
{cps=50}Not wanting to bleed the people dry, but at the same time, not daring to disobey the royal order, you try to find a compromise and offer the villagers to sell their food to you.
{cps=50}Of course, there is no talk about buying at a market price, but at least some kind of compensation will clearly be better than nothing and at least will allow them not to starve to death.
{cps=50}After a little thought, the headman asks for 50 florins.
{cps=50}You pay the peasants out of your own pocket and fill bales and sacks with what little you are able to find.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Gold decreased by 50!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}On the way back, you overhear the conversation of two soldiers, calling you a good Christian and thanking you for not making them take the last crumbs from people.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 3!
{cps=50}You decide to pay, but it turns out that you don't have such money...
{cps=50}You are quite annoyed by the prospect of paying the entire amount out of your own pocket and you offer the rest of the soldiers to chip in.
{cps=50}Since you do not have the money to pay the entire amount out of your own pocket, you offer the rest of the soldiers to chip in.
{cps=50}You pay the peasants and fill bales and sacks with what little you are able to find.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}None of the soldiers are delighted with such an idea. You try to convince them, but your authority is clearly not enough.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Reputation check failed!]
{cps=50}Seeing no way to get out of this situation, you cannot come up with anything better than to simply give the order to go back. The sergeant, the earl, and even the King himself may demand anything they want from you, but you would never take people's last crumbs.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}On the way to camp, you can't help but think that this was the first time you were trusted with a really serious matter... and you didn’t handle it.{w} You try not to think about how unpleasant the conversation with the sergeant, who is now waiting at camp, is going to be.
{cps=50}Heading east from the camp, you soon arrive at a large village called Fer-à-Cheval.
{cps=50}Large, clean houses and quite decently, by the village standards, dressed people immediately strike your eye. The locals clearly live very comfortably.
{cps=50}However, you cannot get to the center of the settlement to have a good look at it - a group of armed people quickly blocks the road.
{cps=50}An elderly man leading them introduces himself as the head of the village...{w} and suggests you get the hell out, stating that looters and foragers are not welcome here.
{cps=50}Although the headman tries to avoid outright rudeness, he does not particularly choose his words, and one can clearly hear ill-concealed threats in them.
{cps=50}You are not going to just stand there and endure insults and threats from some filthy peasant. Without wasting time on unnecessary thoughts, you immediately smack the headman in his cocky face and draw your weapon.
{cps=50}In an effort to avoid bloodshed, you try to reason with the villagers, explaining to them that if they refuse you today, then tomorrow half of the royal army will pay them a visit and their houses would be leveled to the ground.
{cps=50}Despite the frowning faces and disgruntled looks, the peasants clearly realize that you are right and that there is nothing they can do.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check passed!]
{cps=50}The situation is gradually cooling down, and after consulting with his people for some time, the headman agrees to give you the necessary amount of food.
{cps=50}His only condition is that his village will be left alone. {w}You are quite satisfied with this condition, and having filled bags and baskets with all sorts of supplies, you turn back.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Despite all your eloquence, the peasants absolutely do not want to listen to you, stating that, firstly, you have a 'thug's mug' and, secondly, 'you are all lying'.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check failed!]
{cps=50}You do not feel a particular desire to get involved in a dangerous battle with the militiamen for several sacks of flour and decide to turn back.
{cps=50}A thought revolves in your head that it would be nice to punish those yokels for audacious words, but this vendetta will have to be postponed until next time.
{cps=50}But before you have time to ride off, you hear a loud shout from one of the armed peasants behind you - 'That's right! Run away, cowards!'.
{cps=50}Your squad members, who just moments before were happy that everything was done without bloodshed, immediately change their mood and demand to turn back and teach those bastards a lesson.
{cps=50}This stunt becomes the last straw of your patience and, enraged, you turn back, drawing your sword.
{cps=50}The rest of the soldiers rush after you with a battle cry.
{cps=50}The peasants, who have already begun to celebrate the victory, are clearly not ready for such a turn of events and, in panic, are trying to form at least some kind of defense line...
{cps=50}Despite the soldiers' willingness to put up a good fight, you decide to ignore the incident and return home.
{cps=50}Your squad members respond to this order with extreme irritation and discontent. However, despite their momentary rage, you are well aware that with your composure you have just saved many lives - including some of those who are now looking at you with displeasure.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 10!
{cps=50}Realizing that the defense of the village has completely failed, the headman throws his weapon to the ground after the rest of the villagers, begging to spare the population of Fer-ha-Cheval - not to kill people and not to burn houses.
{cps=50}The soldiers are only amused by his begging, some of them are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of a good booty...{w} And someone already raises an axe over the head of the headman.
{cps=50}At the last second, just a moment before the headman would have to part with his head - you manage to stop the execution, deciding to spare the peasant.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}Following this, you also prohibit plundering of the village, ordering to take only equipment of the killed militiamen, as well as the necessary amount of food that was ordered to get.
{cps=50}The members of the squad are very unhappy with this turn of events, claiming that they have been deprived of their legitimate booty. After a certain amount of bickering, you manage to keep the situation under control, but not without a blow to your reputation.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 10!
{cps=50}As a result, you leave the village untouched after collecting the necessary amount of provisions.
{cps=50}You decide not to interfere with the execution, reasoning that the peasant has sealed his fate with his own stupidity and insolence.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!
{cps=50}Having decapitated the headman, the soldiers walk through all the most decent-looking houses, stuffing their pockets with valuables and looting everything they can find.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!
{cps=50}After a couple of hours, you finally head back, leaving what was once a clean and prosperous village behind you, smoking and plundered.
{cps=50}You find a village called Conques a few hours southeast of the camp.
{cps=50}As you approach the settlement, you hear the echoes of a not-so-French song coming from there, and you begin to feel that something is amiss.
{cps=50}{i}My mother told me{vspace=5}Someday I will buy{vspace=5}Galley with good oars{vspace=5}Sail to distant shoars...
{cps=50}You soon realize that your fears were not in vain.
{cps=50}The village is already thoroughly plundered...{w} by your own allies, no less. Those are mercenaries from among the people of Lord Canterbury, whose camp is located on the north side of Cambrai.
{cps=50}A small group of mercenaries saddle their horses, laden with all kinds of booty, loudly singing a song, as they prepare to set off.
{cps=50}You were not the only one who received the task of obtaining food, but the places for foraging were strictly distributed between different units. Having plundered Conques, the mercenaries crossed into foreign territory and they can probably get a serious punishment for such arbitrariness.
{cps=50}Your arrival does not particularly baffle them - only a few people seem to react to you at all, but they just get a better grip on their weapons, while the rest continue to prepare the horses.
{cps=50}Soon, one figure separates from the group of mercenaries and heads towards you for talks.
{cps=50}As you step towards him, you are stopped for a second by one of your squad members. He quickly warns you against rash actions regarding the mercenaries, since quarreling with them is the quickest way to end up six feet under.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}......{w}{vspace=5}It seems that these negotiations will definitely not be easy...
{cps=50}The head of the mercenaries introduces himself as Ruffin, who, judging by the dialect, turns out to be your fellow countryman from South England.{w} He and his people look like real thugs, and the wicked aura emanating from him immediately instills anxiety in you.
{cps=50}Showing him the map marked by the sergeant, you say that you must confiscate the provisions that the mercenaries have looted in Conques, for you have the corresponding order coming from Earl Northampton and the King personally.
{cps=50}Throwing big names around, you hope to make an impression on the mercenary, but your interlocutor brushes them off as if the names he just heard belonged to some rootless peasants.
{cps=50}Immediately switching to a patronizing tone, Ruffin lets you know that you are {b}late{/b} and now you have nothing to claim. His people were the first to reach Conques, which means that the booty is their due.
{cps=50}Smiling, he suggests you wait until they leave, and then walk around the village again - maybe somewhere behind a stove or a bed something is still lying around.
{cps=50}He also winks at you and offers a couple of florins for ale as a 'consolation prize'.
{cps=50}With the words 'Good boy', Ruffin slaps you on the cheek and tosses a coin to the ground. Then, grinning, he turns around and instructs his people to get ready.
{cps=50}This scene clearly would not benefit your reputation among the soldiers if at least one of them was willing to behave differently...
{cps=50}But judging by their faces, they very well understand that you all just got off very easy.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!
{cps=50}Kicking up a cloud of dust, the mercenaries start singing out their song again and slowly ride off to the northwest, leaving you behind.{w} And you remember about the coin, thrown to the ground by Ruffin.
{cps=50}But money is money. You are not used to throwing it around and, despite the ambiguity of the situation, you decide to pick it up...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!
{cps=50}At least so you can return it to Ruffin next time you meet...
{cps=50}You leave it in the mud and swear to yourself that the next time you meet with Ruffin, you will make him pay for this insult.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 2!
{cps=50}Realizing well that there is definitely nothing worthwhile left in the village, you nevertheless decide to quickly walk through the houses.{w} And immediately you come across an unpleasant surprise...
{cps=50}Ruffin's men not only plundered Conques, appropriating what should have been yours, but also slaughtered almost all of its inhabitants.{w} And you've let them get away with it.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!
{cps=50}You know that you have nothing to blame yourself for because the forces were completely unequal. But, nevertheless, you swear that the next time you meet, Ruffin will brutally pay for his trick.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added- [blood_debt.name].
{cps=50}Your squad returns back in complete silence.
{cps=50}Ruffin's proposal does not suit you at all, and you, reminding him of who sent you here, demand that he shares the booty with you.{w} And in return you promise him a couple of florins for ale as a gesture of good will.
{cps=50}Obviously amused by such a reaction, Ruffin throws up his hands and invites you to 'try to come and take' whatever you like.
{cps=50}Meanwhile, his men and members of your squad move closer, forming a ring around you.{w} Barely holding back a laugh, Ruffin patiently awaits your actions...
{cps=50}Feeling your whole body shaking from the adrenaline pumping through your veins, you draw your weapon, engaging in perhaps the most dangerous fight of your life.
{cps=50}The mercenary, whose face is distorted in a crooked smile, takes a step towards you and says:{vspace=5}'Take a deep breath now, boy. It will hurt.'
{cps=50}'That's what I thought.' - Ruffin says contemptuously, spitting on your boots. Then, with a grin, he turns around and instructs his people to get ready.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 5!
{cps=50}Kicking up a cloud of dust, the mercenaries start singing out their song again and slowly ride off to the northwest, leaving you behind.
{cps=50}Your people scatter throughout the village while trying not to meet your eyes.
{cps=50}When Ruffin falls dead from another one of your blows, no one around you can believe it at first.
{cps=50}But when after half a minute the mercenary still does not get up, and the oozing blood already forms a whole lake under his body, your squad rejoices, and Ruffin's people, on the contrary, are significantly shaken.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}In exchange for his body, they agree to give up their booty and soon disappear over the horizon.
{cps=50}Before turning back, you decide to look around the village and quickly walk through the houses.{w} But immediately you come across an unpleasant surprise...
{cps=50}Ruffin's men not only plundered Conques, but also slaughtered almost all of its inhabitants.{w} And escaped almost unpunished, framing you for what they have done.
{cps=50}Ruffin's death, of course, makes little difference and hardly counts as the 'restoration of justice'... However, the fact that at least one of the bastards ended up getting what he deserved definitely pleases you.
{cps=50}To everyone's surprise, Ruffin not only does not emerge victorious from the battle but also, being heavily wounded, ends up being on the verge of death.
{cps=50}After another wound, seeing that the advantage is not on his side, he retreats, hiding behind the backs of his people and promising you that you will meet again.
{cps=50}You, being exhausted by a heavy battle, do not dare to rush after him and turn what was a duel, into a full-on battle with a squad of mercenaries.
{cps=50}In a hurry to retreat, Ruffin's men abandon a significant portion of their booty and quickly disappear into the horizon.
{cps=50}Impressed by your skill and courage, the soldiers immediately begin to celebrate victory, vying with each other to praise you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}Ruffin's men not only plundered Conques, appropriating what should have been yours, but also slaughtered almost all of its inhabitants.{w} And got away from you.
{cps=50}You know that you have nothing to blame yourself for. But, nevertheless, you swear that the next time you meet, Ruffin will brutally pay for his trick.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added- [blood_debt.name].
{cps=50}The miracle that you were hoping for does not happen and, as one would expect, the encounter with a seasoned mercenary doesn't go in your favor.
{cps=50}Receiving blow after blow, you start to bleed heavily, and after another wound, you lose the last bits of your strength and limply fall to the ground amid the laughter of the mercenaries.
{cps=50}'Fell like a bag of shit', - states Ruffin, wiping the blade of his sword on your clothes...{w}{vspace=5}'And fought like one too.'
{cps=50}Having asked your people if there are still those who want to express any claims, Ruffin shrugs his shoulders after receiving no response, turns around, and returns to his men.
{cps=50}As he passes you, he slows down for a second and says in an undertone:{vspace=5}'Welcome to the war, son.'
{cps=50}As the mercenaries ride off, your comrades rush to you to provide first aid and bandage bleeding wounds. Although you did not emerge victorious from this fight, the very fact that you found the courage to challenge Ruffin definitely added to your credibility in the eyes of the soldiers.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Realizing that there is most definitely nothing worthwhile left in the village, you nevertheless decide to send people to quickly inspect the houses.{w} As you expected, they almost instantly return empty-handed, but not without news.
{cps=50}However, when they start talking, you quickly realize that you would have been better off if you never received such news...
{cps=50}Ruffin's men not only plundered Conques, appropriating what should have been yours, but also slaughtered almost all of its inhabitants.{w} And then safely got away.
{cps=50}Back in camp, you are immediately sent to the doctor - Cecilia becomes simply horrified by your condition.
{cps=50}When you try to tell her about what happened, she shuts you up, telling you that you need to conserve your strength. The girl spends the rest of the evening by your bed, treating your many wounds.
{cps=50}At first, she harshly stops all your attempts to speak, but after a few hours, being assured that nothing threatens your life anymore, she calms down, and by midnight you are already chatting about everything in the world.
{cps=50}As you finally fall asleep, Cecilia sits next to you for a long time, guarding your sleep.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 10!
{cps=50}After visiting all the villages marked on the map, you return to the camp, where the sergeant is already waiting for you.
{cps=50}Seeing you return with your wagon loaded to the top with provisions, he immediately brightens, praises you for a job well done, and promises to put in a good word for you with the earl and arrange an early promotion.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) increased by 20!{vspace=5}+125 Florins!
{cps=50}When you tell him about the encounter with a gang of mercenaries in the village of Conques, he is quite puzzled and also promises to report it to the earl.
{cps=50}Seeing that you are not returning empty-handed, he immediately brightens, praises you for a job well done, and promises to put in a good word for you with the earl and arrange an early promotion.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) increased by 10!{vspace=5}+65 Florins!
{cps=50}However, when it comes to counting the provisions you have delivered, the sergeant notices that it is clearly less than it should have been from three villages.
{cps=50}Your excuses about not wanting to rob peasants cause him genuine bewilderment, and he reasonably notes that if you are so compassionate, then maybe you should give up your food for a couple of days in favor of the rest of the soldiers.
{cps=50}In response you also tell him about the encounter with a gang of mercenaries in the village of Conques. This story is very perplexing to the sergeant and he promises to report this incident to the earl.
{cps=50}Seeing that you are not returning empty-handed, he immediately cheers up, but as soon as he realizes that you have brought almost nothing, his joy immediately gives way to irritation.
{cps=50}According to the sergeant, even though starvation does not threaten you now, with such results you can definitely forget about hearty meals for the next week.
{cps=50}When you start talking about some kind of symbolic reward for the time spent, the sergeant suggests you go to hell, stating that anyone would have done the job better, and he was seriously mistaken in entrusting you with such a task.
{cps=50}Nevertheless, he still throws you a few florins, as a minimum compensation for your work.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+35 Florins!
{cps=50}{cps=50}He suggests you go to hell with your excuses and only really listens to the story of your encounter with a gang of mercenaries. The sergeant is clearly concerned about it, and he promises to report the incident to the earl.
{cps=50}Seeing you return empty-handed, the sergeant immediately becomes furious and gives you a harsh scolding, stating that anyone would have done the task better and that you have failed both him and the earl.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) decreased by 10!
{cps=50}He says that if the siege fails because the exhausted soldiers are not able to hold weapons in their hands, you and other smart-asses would be responsible.
{cps=50}When you start talking about at least some kind of symbolic reward for the time spent, the sergeant suggests you go to hell.
{cps=50}He suggests you go to hell with your excuses and only really listens to the story of your encounter with a gang of mercenaries. The sergeant is clearly concerned about it, and he promises to report the incident to the earl.
{cps=50}In an attempt to somehow disperse the overwhelming gloom of everyday life in the siege camp, one of the knights from Lord Sunderland's entourage is organizing a fistfighting tournament, in which one person from the detachment of each of the noblest lords will participate.
{cps=50}When you bring the earl the news about the upcoming tournament, he, being busy with the development of his ingenious plans to conquer the city together with the Prince, does not pay it much mind.{w} And so he suggests to send you there.
{cps=50}Not being a particularly physically gifted person, you don't feel confident enough and can hardly imagine yourself as a successful fist fighter.
{cps=50}Being in good physical shape, you are used to feeling confident in fights, and therefore you are considering the opportunity to participate in the tournament.
{cps=50}The promises of a generous reward for the winner are especially tempting.
{cps=50}On reflection, you accept the earl's offer and decide to participate.
{cps=50}The gist of the tournament is quite simple: all fights consist of three five-minute rounds, according to the results of which the judges determine the winner, who has delivered the most significant blows. Also, the fight can be ended prematurely if one of the fighters surrenders, is knocked out, or otherwise loses the capability to continue the fight.
{cps=50}Having weighed all the pros and cons, you still decide to refuse to participate, thinking that the last thing you need in the middle of a war is to get punched by your own allies.
{cps=50}Especially since you already receive enough damage from your enemies.
{cps=50}Your opponent turns out to be a big lad Fulton Everly - a cavalryman from among the people of Lord Canterbury.
{cps=50}Ideally described as a 'hefty chap', Fulton is almost more wide than tall and has remarkable physical strength. However, like most big guys, he certainly has stamina issues that will become apparent in the later rounds.
{cps=50}Looking around the large crowd of spectators, you notice Cecilia just a few seconds before the start of the fight, who watches you with interest.
{cps=50}You catch her gaze, but a moment later a gong sounds, announcing the start of the battle and ridding your head of all the extraneous thoughts.
{cps=50}Thanks to your superior agility, you move perfectly and easily keep your opponent at a comfortable distance, hitting him with jabs and, occasionally, double punches.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}However, due to the lack of physical strength, there is almost no real power in your punches. Yes, you gain points with them, but your jabs only provoke Fulton, and he reaches the second round almost without taking any real damage.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Strength check failed!]
{cps=50}Despite the apparent lightness, there is real power in each of your strikes. Fulton only grins after taking the first few hits, but by the end of the round his face is already thoroughly smeared with blood, and not a trace of his former grin remains.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Strength check passed!]
{cps=50}You try to keep your opponent at a distance, but clearly overestimate your dexterity and quickly pay for it.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Agility check failed!]
{cps=50}From the very beginning of the fight, Fulton rushes at you like an angry bull. You manage to dodge the first pair of his swoops, but the next jerk takes you by surprise and one of the big guy's sweeping hooks hits you exactly on the bridge of your nose.
{cps=50}You manage to stay on your feet, but your strength is clearly undermined. During the rest of the round, you miss a couple of hard blows, which definitely leave the advantage to Fulton.
{cps=50}Demonstrating your fearlessness, you start the first round with a reckless close-range exchange.
{cps=50}To the surprise of the audience, who expected that the big man would literally break you over the knee, the fight is almost on an equal footing.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Strength check passed!]
{cps=50}Moreover, you manage to emerge victorious from most powerful blow exchanges at a close distance.
{cps=50}Fulton got his clock cleaned, and so he ends the round already unsteady on his feet. The advantage is definitely yours, but you feel quite fatigued.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Endurance check failed!]
{cps=50}Fulton got his clock cleaned, and so he ends the round already unsteady on his feet. The advantage is definitely yours.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Endurance check passed!]
{cps=50}This strategy turns out to be not the most sensible, and the big man's cannon strikes shake you much more than anything you throw back at him.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Strength check failed!]
{cps=50}One of Fulton's sweeping hooks hits you right in the jaw, instantly stripping you of control over your own body. In full survival mode, you somehow make it to the end of the round.
{cps=50}Deciding to build your strategy around accurate counterattacks, you calmly allow your opponent to work as number one and only occasionally attack, trying to get the most out of every such situation.
{cps=50}Dodging another sweeping overhand from Fulton, you get back at him with the most brutal right cross: accurate as a needle prick.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Coordination check passed!]
{cps=50}This brilliant blow instantly flips the round upside down, turning you into an aggressive hunter and him into a fleeing victim.
{cps=50}Fulton somehow makes it to the end of the round.
{cps=50}Throughout the whole round, you look for an opportunity for one perfect hit that could turn the tide of the fight, but the opportunity never presents itself.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Coordination check failed!]
{cps=50}Fulton confidently takes the round.
{cps=50}In the second round, you decide to keep your distance.
{cps=50}Fulton, who has used up a fair share of his strength, is significantly slowing down, but he still remains dangerous.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}He can do nothing to counter your speed, and you again, spinning around him like a seasoned matador, shower the enemy with a hail of blows.
{cps=50}Their effectiveness, however, still leaves much to be desired, and Fulton does not take any serious damage.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Strength check failed!]
{cps=50}You take the second round, but you feel noticeably exhausted.
{cps=50}Your blows remain all the same scathing, and by the end of the round bloodied and bruised Fulton falls, but gets up wobbling right after.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Strength check passed!]
{cps=50}But your attempt to play the matador does not work, and the enemy confidently lands one blow after another.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Agility check failed!]
{cps=50}Soon, you begin to see double, your legs grow heavy, and you almost lose the ability to defend yourself.
{cps=50}Squeezing you in the corner of the ring, Fulton attacks you with a series of powerful punches. You fall to the ground and no longer get up.
{cps=50}The second round goes to Fulton.
{cps=50}You start the second round with a confident performance at a close range.
{cps=50}With a series of heavy body punches, you knock the air out of Fulton, forcing him to go into deep defense mode.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Strength check passed!]
{cps=50}Most of his attempts to respond are extremely unconvincing, and by the end of the round you have no doubt that the second segment is yours.
{cps=50}Seeing that the enemy almost doesn't protect his upper body with his hands, you put all your remaining strength into one last strike, almost blowing poor Fulton's head off.
{cps=50}The defeated enemy crashes to the ground and begins to show at least some signs of life only a few minutes later.
{cps=50}However, you have to pay for this success with a complete depletion of your stamina.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Endurance check failed!]
{cps=50}You initiate a brutal exchange of punches in the center of the ring, but your opponent comes out victorious, surpassing you in every episode.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Strength check failed!]
{cps=50}Soon, you begin to see double, your legs grow heavy and you almost lose the ability to defend yourself.
{cps=50}Fulton confidently takes the second round.
In the second round, you decide to focus on counterattacks.
{cps=50}Pressing on you like an angry beast, Fulton often neglects his defense, and you successfully use this opportunity, unexpectedly reaching his jaw with a heavy double punch.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Coordination check passed!]
{cps=50}The enemy is clearly heavily shaken and almost loses the ability to defend himself effectively. It is only a matter of time until you finish him, and after a dozen blows, Fulton is in a knockout.
{cps=50}Fulton confidently wins this round.
{cps=50}In the third round, you decide to keep your distance.
Having lost his strength and breathing heavily, Fulton turns into a static target. It's easy for you to dodge his slow punches and throw quick jabs and combinations in response.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}The enemy withstands all of your punches and ends the battle still standing up, without breaking down under fire.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Strength check failed!]
{cps=50}The enemy is already crumbling under the hail of your blows, and when another hard jab breaks his nose with a loud crunch, he finally falls to the ground. And doesn't get up anymore.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Strength check passed!]
{cps=50}The enemy withstands all of your punches and ends the battle still standing up, without breaking down under fire.
{cps=50}By the third round, you feel fatigued and you can't easily outplay Fulton in speed and agility anymore.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Agility check failed!]
{cps=50}The fight, against your will, boils down to punching at close range and the enemy clearly inflicts more significant blows.
{cps=50}Fulton won the third round.
{cps=50}Knowing well what the audience wants, you choose to end the fight in a decisive fashion.
Your iron determination is unshakable, but the flesh is weak.
The body, exhausted by a heavy fight, cannot withstand the insane exchange of blows, and when another one of Fulton's heavy hooks hits your head - the light for you goes out.
{cps=50}Tired to the point of exhaustion, Fulton lost not only his speed by the third round but also strength, turning into an almost static target.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Strength check passed!]
{cps=50}Confidently dodging his rare blows, you land hit after hit as if with a hammer.
{cps=50}Your iron determination is unshakable, but the flesh is weak.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Strength check failed!]
{cps=50}The body, exhausted by a heavy fight, cannot withstand the insane exchange of blows, and when another one of Fulton's heavy hooks hits your head - the light for you goes out.
{cps=50}You lose the fight by knockout.
{cps=50}Comrades, who come to your rescue, help you come to your senses and escort you to your tent. The rest of the day you spend laying, groaning, moaning, and indulging in dull reflections on the mistakes you have made during the fight.
{cps=50}As a result, you execute an excellent knockout, which brings you victory and a thunderous ovation from a crowd of spectators.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 15!{vspace=5}Reputation (the earl) increased by 5!
{cps=50}The promised reward is not long in coming.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+55 Florins!

{cps=50}After three rounds of intense fight, Fulton wins by the judges' decision.

{cps=50}The day before the final assault one of your comrades brings you horrible news...
{cps=50}Medics fought for Bartholomew's life for a long time, but just like many others who were seriously wounded, he did not make it through.
{cps=50}The news of his death immediately poisons your entire existence, leaving you full of anger and sorrow.
{cps=50}And now his blood is on your hands.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}A few days before the final assault, you unexpectedly receive great news. Thanks to your help, as well as Cecilia's efforts, Bartholomew was able to pull through and is now on the mend.
{cps=50}You go to visit your friend and find him in a cheerful mood. Perhaps even overly cheerful.{vspace=5}Thanking you for your help, Bartholomew declares that he is spoiling for a rematch after his inglorious 'performance' during the previous assault.
{cps=50}According to him, although the doctors banned him from any activity in the coming days, he had already decided that he would flee the infirmary to take part in the upcoming grand assault.
{cps=50}Using your authority, as well as the position of a person who has just saved his life, you dissuade Bartholomew from taking a rash step, convincing him that there will be more than enough battles and exploits in his life.
{cps=50}Albeit reluctantly, he still gives in, agreeing to take care of his health. Wishing you the best of luck in the coming battle, he promises to pray for you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Despite realizing the danger that Bartholomew brings onto himself, you nevertheless decide not to dissuade him.
{cps=50}The reason as to why you didn't is not entirely clear to you, and this night you cannot fall asleep, suffering from remorse.
{cps=50}After the capture of the city, most of the lords and commanders of various detachments of the royal army rushed to seize all the most prominent and wealthy buildings in the city, turning them into their own makeshift residences.
{cps=50}In an attempt to snatch a bigger piece of the pie, the lords immediately started squabbling over the houses of the richest merchants, as well as the city hall.
{cps=50}The appearance of the French army on the horizon did not in the least temper anyone's ambitions, and the disputes of the lords resulted in several bloody skirmishes between their people.
{cps=50}It was possible to put an end to the brewing storm only after the personal intervention of the king, who resolved all the disputes himself.
{cps=50}Lord Canterbury was the most aggressive participant in these clashes, as he portrayed himself as the hero of the last assault, who almost single-handedly won the decisive battle of Cambrai.
{cps=50}Apparently, King Edward shared the same opinion, and so he allocated the city hall as the lord's residence - one of the richest and most beautiful buildings in Cambrai.
{cps=50}The earl, on the other hand, got a house of one of the wealthy merchants as his residence - a very decent place, but clearly not even close to falling within the definition of 'the best in the city'.
{cps=50}Lord Canterbury was the most aggressive participant in these clashes, actively challenging the role of the earl and his people as heroes of the last assault and trying to secure this title for himself.
{cps=50}However, despite the groundlessness of such claims, the King took his side in the dispute, allocating the city hall as his residence - one of the richest and most beautiful buildings in Cambrai.
{cps=50}Despite the obvious reasons for dissatisfaction, the earl did not express any negative reaction in public, demonstrating that he would not dispute the king's decision and is satisfied with it.
{cps=50}And now, having arrived at his residence, you find him in a good mood.
{cps=50}And here he is - the reliable person you asked to bring.
{cps=50}Ah, [name]! My boy! The conqueror of Cambrai himself! Good to see you, [name].
{cps=50}Ah, [name]! My boy! To be honest, I expected more from you during the last assault... But it can't be helped - what happened has happened.
{cps=50}Anyway, I'm glad to see you in one piece.
{cps=50}As you yourself should understand, we called you here for a reason. There is a very important task that requires a smart person to carry it out.
{cps=50}Great. Although I did not expect any other answer from you. So listen up...
{cps=50}You can always rely on me, but only if I can rely on you too. If you know what I mean.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}For a second, an awkward silence hangs in the room, and you already begin to regret what you said.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}However, after exchanging meaningful glances, the earl and the prince both grin.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Reputation check passed!]
{cps=50}Ha! He is clearly not that stupid, that guy.
{cps=50}You bet! I wouldn't trust him with our business otherwise.
{cps=50}You are right, [name] - if there is a matter, then there must be a reward. Moreover, you have already shown yourself capable more than once.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Digging in his pockets, the Prince fishes out a small clinking pouch and tosses it on the table in front of you.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}+75 Florins!
{cps=50}Well, as you can see, you can definitely rely on me - now it's your turn to prove yourself. So listen up...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Reputation check failed!]
{cps=50}Hey, watch your mouth, [name]! Don't forget who you're talking to.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (the earl) decreased by 3!
{cps=50}You will get your reward, boy. But first, you have to prove that you deserve it. So listen up...
{cps=50}According to the Prince, despite the seeming inevitability of a big clash with the approaching French army, in reality, neither side wants to initiate a battle.
{cps=50}The hastily assembled French army is far from being as strong as it might seem at first glance, and King John himself doubts its strength more than others.
{cps=50}Whereas Edward's troops are exhausted by the long siege of Cambrai, which turned out to be a much more difficult and bloody endeavor than was planned.
{cps=50}In addition, the defeat of Thomas Marshal's detachment, which was previously sent by the king to delay the advance of the French and buy us time for the assault, turned out to be extremely painful for the English army.
{cps=50}Eduard understands that by and large, the military adventure he has started has failed, and there can be no talk of any continuation of it - he will have to be content with only the booty that was taken in Cambrai and the plundered environs of the city, as well as the political successes.
{cps=50}Moreover, the parties have already begun negotiations on signing an armistice treaty, and it would seem that the war could be considered over...
{cps=50}But not everything is so simple. It is important for both parties to save face in the negotiations and no one is going to yield.
{cps=50}You should understand that we have few trump cards left now, and therefore it is vital to come up with at least something that would tip the scales in our favor when it comes to negotiations.
{cps=50}Do we have a plan?
{cps=50}We always have a plan.
{cps=50}One of the key people in the French army is William de Roche, an old war dog and the right hand of King John. At his prime, he alone shed more blood than all the knights of England put together...
{cps=50}He is the one who actually stands at the head of the forces of King John. He was also the main reason behind the victory over Marshal's detachment - grinding a quarter of our army into powder in one battle.
{cps=50}But, more importantly, de Roche is almost the only force that holds together the patchwork that is the French army.
{cps=50}If he disappears for some reason, their nobility will immediately quarrel among themselves about titles, positions, and rewards.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}As it would actually have happened here as well, if it was not for my father, who rules with an iron fist.
{cps=50}Without de Roche, their army will slowly but surely fall to pieces.{w} And that means...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The prince looks at you pointedly, as if urging you to continue his phrase.
{cps=50}That means that it is time for him to meet his ancestors.
{cps=50}Exactly. Fortunately for us, de Roche has already looked death in the face a hundred times and is used to laughing at any danger. Every morning he starts by detouring the French positions and in some places rides up to the walls of the fortress a little closer than he probably should.
{cps=50}The task is simple: shoot this son of a bitch.
{cps=50}It would be quite problematic to make such a shot from a bow  - therefore, it is better to find a good crossbow and some heavy duty bolts. It would be even better to smear them with some rubbish or poison to ensure death when hit.
{cps=50}You, as I see, are not that stupid and hardly plan to spend your whole life running someone else's errands. Take this as an opportunity to prove yourself - it doesn't matter to me who will shoot and from what: if you are confident - do it yourself, if not - find a good marksman, I think there are enough of them in the army.
{cps=50}The main thing is that de Roche must die. This is the only thing that interests me and this is the only thing that should interest you.
{cps=50}Is it clear?
{cps=50}Of course.
{cps=50}That's great...{w} Also, I think I don't have to remind you that if you miss or hit him and he survives, then this precious opportunity would be lost forever. Because de Roche won't make the same mistake twice.{w} Don't let me down.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [nighty_knight.name].
{cps=50}The Falcon Tower rises almost above the French camp and offers an excellent view of it.
{cps=50}Also you can clearly see William de Roche making his daily morning detours of the French positions.
{cps=50}However, now, standing on the tower and looking down, you clearly understand that hitting him from such a distance will be not 'difficult' but 'incredibly difficult'.
{cps=50}And it's not just about the distance and the moving target, but also the strong fickle wind, which can easily throw the bolt off its trajectory.
{cps=50}Shooting with a light crossbow is out of the question. And you should ditch hunting bolts - you obviously need something heavier here...
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}And you should probably find a more experienced marksman as well...
{cps=50}Hiding early in the morning at one of the embrasures of the Falcon Tower, you look out for Sire William, who is about to appear on a hillock near the camp...
{cps=50}After a few long minutes of waiting, you notice a stately horseman leisurely circling the perimeter of the French camp.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You must have a loaded crossbow to shoot.
{cps=50}Throwing up the crossbow and ensconcing with it at the embrasure, you closely follow the movements of the rider below, tracking the trajectory of his movement.
{cps=50}Distance to the target, deflection, correction for the wind - in a few short seconds, a lot of thoughts and calculations rush through your head.
{cps=50}When the rider once again makes a small stop to look around, you let go of the bowstring, sending the bolt at your target with a whistle...
{cps=50}But the firing power of a light crossbow with its thin bowstring is clearly not enough, and sudden gusts of wind quickly throw the bolt off its trajectory, carrying it somewhere off to the side.
{cps=50}However, a light hunting bolt turns out to be unable to withstand sudden gusts of wind and quickly loses its impulse, flying away somewhere off to the side.
{cps=50}Despite the fact that you have tried your best to fire the perfect shot, your experience with the crossbow is clearly not enough...{w} And the bolt misses its target.
{cps=50}Your calculations turn out to be perfect and the bolt hits the rider, throwing him off the horse.
{cps=50}Kicking up a cloud of dust, he rolls down the hill to the French tents...{w} It is done.
{cps=50}Before descending from the tower, you pause for a short while to observe the enemy camp, which is rapidly plunging into a grand commotion.
{cps=50}When you come to the earl to report on the completed mission, he takes your success for granted, stating that he did not expect anything less from you.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (the earl) increased by 10!
{cps=50}As a thank you for the work done, he gives you a small bag of coins.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}+75 Florins!
{cps=50}Hiding early in the morning at one of the embrasures of the Falcon Tower, together with Vettori, you look out for Sire William, who is about to appear on a hillock near the camp ...
{cps=50}You hand the poisoned bolt over to Vettori. The Italian carefully loads the crossbow, then comfortably stations himself at the embrasure, throws up his weapon, and prepares to fire.
{cps=50}The Italian carefully loads the crossbow, then comfortably stations himself at the embrasure, throws up his weapon, and prepares to fire.
{cps=50}Vettori is in no hurry and aims for what seems like an eternity. You already wanted to snap him out of it, but as soon as you open your mouth, there is a click and a bowstring throws the bolt forward with a whistle.
{cps=50}The calculation turns out to be perfect, and the bolt hits the target, throwing the rider off the saddle and to the ground.
{cps=50}Kicking up a cloud of dust, he rolls down the hill to the French tents ...
{cps=50}'It's done,' Vettori says grinning. 'That's how we shoot in Italy.'
{cps=50}The rider, who notices your unsuccessful shot, waves his hand mockingly and safely hides inside the camp.
{cps=50}Spitting down at him and muttering curses, you also go home.
{cps=50}You can see pure disappointment on the earl's face as you report on the failed mission.
{cps=50}After silently listening to your excuses about the strong wind and the difficulty of hitting the target, he responds with only a couple of abrupt phrases, saying that you have let everyone down. And then he shoos you away.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (the earl) decreased by 10!
{cps=50}The messenger from the earl tells you that due to your sluggishness, your services are no longer needed and another marksman has already been found for the murder of de Roche.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 20!
{cps=50}Later that day, you learn that the assassination attempt was unsuccessful and the marksman missed. This, however, doesn't bother you too much, since you are going to get your ass whooped by the earl and the prince anyway.
{cps=50}Shortly after the murder of William de Roche, the earl summons you to his place.{w} Expecting to get praised, you are very surprised to find the earl and the Prince very annoyed.
{cps=50}Bad news, [name]. Fate has turned its ass on us again.
{cps=50}This bastard de Roche has survived.
{cps=50}...！？
{cps=50}But, sire, I saw with my own eyes how a crossbow bolt hit him. Even if the wound was not fatal, then he definitely should have died from sepsis!
{cps=50}But, sire, I saw with my own eyes how a crossbow bolt hit him. Even if the wound was not fatal, then he definitely should have died from blood loss!
{cps=50}Yes, yes... I don't know what you saw there, but de Roche is alive and that's a fact.
{cps=50}But how...
{cps=50}My spies in the French camp reported back this morning. King John sent for the best doctors from Paris - the wound is serious, but not fatal...
{cps=50}Personally, I assume the fact that we even managed to hit the target to be a miracle in itself. Given the distance and difficulty of the shot...
{cps=50}When you assume, you make an ASS of U and ME, boy. And nobody asked you, by the way.
{cps=50}This is not a miracle, [name], but a well thought out plan.
{cps=50}And well thought out plans are what we have in abundance.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}These words make your blood run cold...
{cps=50}The French think that by hiding de Roche in their camp, they have made him safe, but no such luck. We'll get him there too.
{cps=50}And to be honest, judging by the information that we have, he is in very bad condition and may not make it anyway.
{cps=50}Especially considering his age.
{cps=50}I think it's his age. When I got to my first war in Scotland two decades ago, this son of a bitch was already covered in battle scars from head to toe and was considered the best warrior on the continent.
{cps=50}He simply destroyed us at Bannockburn - out of the entire royal army, there were only your father, me, and a hundred soldiers, who managed to survive...
{cps=50}Yes, those were the times. He took many lives, but today the bell tolls for him, and that means that it is time for de Roche to visit his ancestors.
{cps=50}For him, you say?
{cps=50}Send not to know, for whom the bell tolls...
{cps=50}It tolls for thee... Yes, we all will meet our end, sooner or later. Lord have mercy on our souls.
{cps=50}{cps=50}Given the pace of the campaign, it may well be that your generation will have to continue to wage this damn war. Or even your children's children, huh.
{cps=50}Okay, back to the point. The issue with de Roche needs to be resolved - it almost worked out the first time, so it will definitely work out the second.
{cps=50}As already mentioned, we have already developed a plan.
{cps=50}We've planned everything. This time, there will be no slip-ups.
{cps=50}So. Listen...
{cps=50}Reports of the scouts show that wounded de Roche is in the depths of the French camp and is well guarded. You definitely can't just break through to him.
{cps=50}According to the Prince's plan, the group number one will distract the French. Late at night, a large English detachment will launch a diversionary attack on the French camp and try to set it on fire.
{cps=50}{cps=50}When the battle ensues, the English will begin to retreat, creating a false sense of success in the enemy, which they will almost certainly try to develop, withdrawing even more forces from their camp.
{cps=50}Under the cover of all this confusion, the second group will sneak into the camp and then will need to quickly get to de Roche's tent and end him.
{cps=50}In this scheme, you are assigned the role of the commander of the second group - you will lead your people to the camp to find and kill de Roche.
{cps=50}I think so too.
{cps=50}Thanks for sharing your opinion, [name]. We'll be sure to reach out to you if we need any more of your 'peasant insight'.
{cps=50}You can go now, [name]. Get ready.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [nighty_knight2.name].
{cps=50}Shortly after your failed attempt to assassinate William de Roche, the earl summons you to his place.{w} You anticipated getting punished for the previous failure, but to your surprise, you find the earl and the prince in a good mood.
{cps=50}Well, marksman? It seems that fate itself gives you a chance to correct your mistakes.
{cps=50}De Roche. The old man is in a vulnerable position and this time we simply cannot pass up such a chance.
{cps=50}But he has just survived an assassination attempt... Isn't he supposed to lay low and be extremely careful now?
{cps=50}Sure thing. But, fortunately, Lady Fate herself is on our side.
{cps=50}My spies in the French camp reported back this morning. King John sent for the best doctors from Paris - de Roche has serious health problems.
{cps=50}But it is not yet clear what is up with him specifically...
{cps=50}Given the pace of the campaign, it may well be that your generation will have to continue to wage this damn war. Or even your children's children, huh.
{cps=50}Okay, back to the point. The issue with de Roche needs to be resolved - it did not work out the first time, but it will work out the second.
{cps=50}We have already developed a plan.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}These words make your blood run cold ...
{cps=50}When the battle ensues, the English will begin to retreat, creating a false sense of success in the enemy, which they will almost certainly try to develop, withdrawing even more forces from their camp.
{cps=50}As you prepare to carry out another insane plan made by the earl and the prince, you can't get rid of the thought that this whole venture is simply a suicide mission.
{cps=50}To sneak into the heart of the French camp, kill a well-guarded target, and then manage to get back. Sounds... difficult, if not completely impossible.
{cps=50}However, you obviously have no choice and, at the appointed hour, when the English troops start the diversion, you, at the head of a small detachment, are preparing to break into the enemy's camp.
{cps=50}Your comrades stay outside to cover the escape route, so you enter the tent alone.
{cps=50}The insides of the unexpectedly spacious premise are illuminated by just a few dim rays of moonlight. You make out a human figure lying on a large bed, surrounded by numerous vials of medicine and bottles of decoction.
{cps=50}The darkness makes it impossible to clearly distinguish his facial features, and the situation does not allow any delay. Your comrades, remaining at the tent entrance, urge you to hurry up and get rid of de Roche as soon as possible so that you can run away from the buzzing hive that this French camp has turned into.
{cps=50}You decisively go up to the man, planning to cut his throat in one swift movement and disappear into the night right away.{w} However, there is something that could not have been predicted.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}Moonlight reflects off the blade of a dagger going towards your throat - from somewhere on the side, another figure, hidden by the shadows, suddenly attacks you.
{cps=50}Despite the advantage of surprise, the stranger's attack is inept, and you easily dodge it.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}After that, you throw the enemy to the side with a powerful kick. As if made of paper, the stranger immediately loses his balance and falls to the ground with a groan.
{cps=50}A woman's groan.
{cps=50}Eva!?
{cps=50}What are you... What the hell are you doing here?
{cps=50}And this... This is William de Roche, the right hand of the French king...
{cps=50}What the hell...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tears begin to run down Eva's cheeks.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}For whom the bell tolls?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The war, started by the old men who try to settle long-forgotten scores with each other, widely opens its insatiable bloody mouth... To devour first them and then their children. And the children of their children.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Standing before unconscious de Roche and his crying daughter with a sword in your hand, you involuntarily recall the earl's words about the war, which is destined to last a hundred years and which even the children of your children will have to fight.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Perhaps Eva is right. And some orders are really better off not being followed.
{cps=50}There is nothing more disturbing than choosing between feelings and duty. Largely because this puzzle always has the correct choice.
{cps=50}You know what is the right thing to do, but the question is whether you have the courage to do it.
{cps=50}Under the gallantry and feigned nobility of knights, beautiful speeches of kings, sweet promises of lords, epic stories and feats in the name of the throne and faith...
{cps=50}...there is an ugly underside. With poisons, cloaks, and daggers. With dastardly murders, unworthy deeds, and backstabbing.
{cps=50}And someone has to do the dirty work so that the bards would have something to put songs together about.
{cps=50}You cut de Roche's throat and leave sobbing Eva behind.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 50!
{cps=50}As you leave, you see how she tries to raise the dagger, but she is not able to do it as her hands shake violently, and all that is left for her is to throw curses at you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) lowered by 100!
{cps=50}The news of your successful mission is celebrated first by the earl and the Prince, and then throughout the whole English camp.
{cps=50}And you become the hero of an entire army overnight.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) improved by 20!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) improved by 15!{vspace=5}+ 100 Florins!
{cps=50}Realizing well that you would most definitely regret it more than once, you lower your sword and take a step back.
{cps=50}It seems like the unambiguousness of this movement lifts a rock from Eva's chest as she exhales heavily, pouring out a chaotic and semi-coherent stream of words of gratitude.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) improved by 50!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 20!
{cps=50}She tries to hug you, but the loud noise from the outside sobers you up, and so, after throwing a farewell glance at her, you rush away.
{cps=50}You tell your comrades that de Roche was not in the tent and instead of him there was some other noble duffus - the information received from the spies turned out to be incorrect.
{cps=50}There is no time to continue the search, and all that is left for you is to get back as fast as you can.
{cps=50}{cps=50}The news of your failed mission is met with great discontent. The earl makes it clear to you that by failing the same highly demanding assignment twice, you have severely undermined his trust in you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}{cps=50}The prince, for his part, does not attack you with devastating criticism, but notes with disappointment that the operation to distract the French cost the English army a hundred brave warriors who laid down their heads in the night battle.
{cps=50}{cps=50}And now, thanks to you, their lives have been wasted.
{cps=50}{cps=50}What is more sad, however, is that the failure of this gambit further establishes the superiority of the French over the royal army. And now, all that is left for Edward is to negotiate peace.
{cps=50}{cps=50}And obviously on far from the most favorable terms.
{cps=50}This whole speech leaves a weird aftertaste. On the one hand, you have just put an end to the possibility of successfully completing a military campaign.
{cps=50}On the other hand, however, you seem to have just saved several thousand lives.
The medics accompanying King Edward III’s army are led by Pepe Grimaldi - a famous Italian anatomist and physician. Rumours say that it cost the English king an actual fortune to get him and his team to participate in the campaign.
{cps=50}The most prominent figure among the many doctors is definitely Pepe's daughter, Cecilia Grimaldi. Despite her
{cps=50}Wandering around the camp in search of a medic, you unexpectedly stumble upon a young girl who is in charge of one of the medical tents.
{cps=50}As she glances over at you, her eyes dim, and she obviously loses any interest in you completely.
{cps=50}The thing is, I'm looking for a doctor...
{cps=50}You found one. My name is Cecilia Grimaldi and I am a doctor in the service of the king of England.
{cps=50}And you seem to be from the militia, right?
{cps=50}I am one of the militiamen from Earl Northampton's squad. My name is...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You can read a complete loss of interest in you as well as a slight disgust in her facial expression the moment she hears the word 'militiaman'.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 1!
{cps=50}It's clear that you should have started your introduction to this girl with some other 'interesting fact about self'.
{cps=50}Let's get straight to the point. What do you need?
{cps=50}A knight then, eh? In Earl Northampton's service? In that case, I beg your pardon, sir.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check passed!]
{cps=50}But let me ask...
{cps=50}...do you dress like that because you are poor, or is it just Northampton fashion that I'm not aware of? I'm afraid I'm not up to date with the latest English trends.
{cps=50}Bright rags are not my thing. I have my own style.
{cps=50}A style? Well, this is something new. I have never heard such an excuse for poverty.
{cps=50}So, what can I do for you?
{cps=50}I prefer to stand out for my actions, rather than for bright expensive rags.
{cps=50}What loud and noble words. Very convenient, by the way, for a person in a shabby gambeson...
{cps=50}And, let me ask you, sire knight, have you already done any things that you could be proud of? I would be glad to hear about your feats.
{cps=50}I haven’t done anything significant yet, but rest assured, you don’t have to wait long. This war will make me the most famous knight in all of Europe.
{cps=50}Yeah-yeah. I definitely believe it. I just hope that I won't have to pull the arrows out of your cold body a couple of weeks from now.
{cps=50}So how can I help you?
{cps=50}Well, I definitely have plenty of feats. I have slayed all the dragons on the continent with my own hands.
{cps=50}...?{w} Dragons?{w} I've traveled a lot throughout Europe, but I confess I've never seen anything even remotely resembling a dragon...
{cps=50}And I wonder why. You don't have to thank me, though.
{cps=50}...{w} I wasn't going to anyway.{w} Although, once again I have to give you your due, if you are half as good at swinging a sword as you are at running your mouth, then you clearly have a great future ahead.

{cps=50}By the way, you are far from the first girl to praise my ability to run my mouth...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Cecilia rolls her eyes in mock horror.
{cps=50}Well, my father always said that you can drag a yokel out of a village, but not a village out of a yokel. But okay - I'll take note of that.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 2!]
{cps=50}So, how can I be of help?
{cps=50}A knight? You don't look too much like a knight, I'll be honest.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check failed!]
{cps=50}Rags instead of armor, a crumbling shield, and a hat instead of a helmet. Well, at least the sword is not wooden... or is it wooden?
{cps=50}Rags instead of armor and a hat instead of a helmet. Well, at least the sword is not wooden... or is it wooden?
{cps=50}Forgive my rudeness, but judging by your age, you should be playing war rather than participating in one.
{cps=50}So what do you want?
{cps=50}I saw your fight... You fought well. I think that this is not the case when you should be upset over defeat - you showed a strong character. And this is the most important thing...

{cps=50}And I'm very glad you're all right.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 15!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You find Cecilia extremely displeased and annoyed.
{cps=50}What's wrong?
{cps=50}I don't know what to do! I have so many wounded, but I can not help them with anything, you understand - there is nothing I can do! Due to the overabundance of casualties during the last two assaults, we started to have serious problems with medical supplies.
{cps=50}I have a lot of dying people in my care, but there is simply nothing to treat them with. The king's people say that new carts are already on the way, but how long till they get here?! One or at most two more days, and half of all those who I am quite capable of saving now would be dead for sure.
{cps=50}And I didn't come here to be a gravedigger or a mortician! I can save those people, but I just have no medications to make it happen... All I want is to do my job...
{cps=50}I understand that it seems like I'm asking too much, but perhaps you will be able to help somehow... Any medicines and drugs that you can get will surely save someone's life.
{cps=50}And I will be forever grateful to you.
{cps=50}I'm ready to do anything for you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}This boldness catches Cecilia by surprise, and she raises her eyebrows. However, such an answer was clearly pleasing to her - she cannot hide it.
{cps=50}I hoped that the part about saving many lives would still motivate you, but I'm not going to lie, this answer is fine by me too.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 5!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [pharmacist.name].
{cps=50}I'm afraid I have to refuse. I cannot help you.
{cps=50}......
{cps=50}I understand. After all, these are strangers whose lives are of no value to you. I have no right to force you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 2!
{cps=50}If I ever need the services of a doctor, then...
{cps=50}I'll be glad to help. I am here exactly to take care of the health of the knights and their people.
{cps=50}Most minor injuries can be healed free of charge, but if more serious medical attention is needed, then, I'm afraid, there will be a price.
{cps=50}Try to treat your wounds and injuries as soon as possible. You can get rid of most ailments if you deal with them in a timely manner.
{cps=50}However, if time is lost, the consequences of a particular wound can easily become chronic, and then there would be nothing to do about it.
{cps=50}Then one of the doctors will definitely help you. But it is unlikely that it will be me - I am here to monitor the health of more... important people.
{cps=50}By the way - free advice. Try to treat your wounds and injuries as soon as possible. You can get rid of most ailments if you deal with them in a timely manner.
{cps=50}I hope you will excuse my tactlessness, but I just can't help but ask - how did a girl like you end up in the war?
{cps=50}No need to apologize. I completely understand. I'll be honest with you - for the most part, I'm here because of the money too.
{cps=50}The English king needed the best doctors from all over Europe, and he wasn't skimping on fees.
{cps=50}This offer was even more tempting to me as a scientist combining medical practice with anatomical research.
{cps=50}Even if I do not approve of the war, the blood that will be shed in this war, at least in some sense, will not be shed in vain.
{cps=50}Forgive my curiosity, but how did a girl like you end up in the war?
{cps=50}I'm not sure this is your business.
{cps=50}The knighthood obliges me to ask if I can help you with something. I am completely at your service.
{cps=50}Oh, how sweet. Do I look that desperate to you?
{cps=50}You are walking on thin ice, sire knight.{w} However, I'm not going to lie, at the moment I would really appreciate someone's help.
{cps=50}How can I be of help?
{cps=50}The fact is that, during one of the recent moves, I lost my sword.
{cps=50}Don't look at me like that! I understand that for a warrior a sword means much more than just a sharpened piece of iron you can stab someone with... However, I am not a warrior.
{cps=50}I have a huge luggage full of much more important things than this piece of iron! From medicines and tools to the autumn collection of Venetian dresses...
{cps=50}Anyways, what was I talking about?{w} Rumors are already going around the camp that the king is about to go forward with the attack, and the possibility of being in the midst of a battle without any weapon scares me a little.
{cps=50}Anyways, what was I talking about?{w} Right. See, we are in the middle of a military campaign, and the French make sorties from the besieged city every now and then... Everyone around is trying to assure me that I am absolutely safe here, but I have a hard time believing it, and the possibility of being in the midst of the next battle without a weapon scares me a little.
{cps=50}Obviously, I am not going to participate in anything like this and your military affairs do not concern me, but I will not be sincere if I say that I will not feel safer with a sword.
{cps=50}I hope you understand exactly what I am asking of you?
{cps=50}I will get you the best sword in the whole royal army. I give you my word.
{cps=50}{cps=50}I will be very grateful, and... I will certainly return the favor.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - Queen of Swords.
{cps=50}Cecilia, you don't need a sword - you have me. I vow to protect you from any danger and to fight for you to the last drop of my blood.
{cps=50}Oh, please, stop it. I've already heard similar assurances, and from much more... imposing knights. I don't need your vows. I need a sword.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 2!
{cps=50}I will be very grateful, and... I will certainly return the favor.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - Queen of Swords.
{cps=50}About your sword...
{cps=50}Oh, did you get it? Show me!
{cps=50}I fulfilled your request and got you a sword.
{cps=50}Great news. Despite your... questionable appearance, for some reason I immediately realized that I can rely on you, sire knight.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 10!
{cps=50}Well, couldn't you find something more presentable?{w} It seems to me that this sword is older than the two of us combined... Are you sure it won't fall apart?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 3!
{cps=50}However, this is better than nothing, I guess. Thanks.
{cps=50}That means that he will be okay, doesn't it?
{cps=50}More precisely - maybe he will be okay, but only if he gets treatment as soon as possible. He is on the verge of death, and any delay in his case can easily turn out to be fatal.
{cps=50}Okay, so be it - I'll take it upon myself. But I will consider it contract work, and contract work has a price.
{cps=50}Okay, so be it - I'll take him upon myself. But we still have one major problem.
{cps=50}These are honorable words...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 2!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}By the exhausted look of the girl, you can clearly tell that she is not deceiving you. But since it is about your friend, you are not going to give in.
{cps=50}More precisely - maybe he will be okay, but only if he gets treatment as soon as possible. He is on the verge of death and any delay in his case can easily turn out to be fatal.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}By the exhausted look of the girl, you can clearly tell that she is not deceiving you. But it doesn't make it any easier.
{cps=50}You can rightfully consider yourself a guardian angel of the English army - and I'm not the only one who owes you, but also a good half of the royal army.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 15!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 15!
{cps=50}Thank you. Maybe you just saved someone's life.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 5!
{cps=50}If you get injured, then this medicine will help you to hold on just a little longer...{w} Until you are in my hands...
{cps=50}I got everything you asked for.
{cps=50}Are you kidding!? Did you really get it all?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 7!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}Well, that is great. In this case, your friend's chances of making it out alive increase greatly. I will take care of him personally - you can rest assured.
{cps=50}Do not take this as indelicacy, but, since you can get those kinds of medicine, can I ask you for a favor? Together we could help treat many wounded...
{cps=50}I'm afraid I have to refuse.
{cps=50}I understand. Bartholomew is your friend after all, and these are strangers. I have no right to force you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 2!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item submited - [potent_medicine.name].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item submited - [antidote2.name].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}-50 Florins!
{cps=50}Everything you've heard is true.
{cps=50}I tried to keep my word to you, but war is war; and sometimes you are forced to shed blood, even when you want it the least in the world.
{cps=50}Besides the word given to you, I also pledged allegiance to my suzerain Earl Northampton and the King of England. And these vows oblige me...
{cps=50}They oblige me to carry out the orders received. Whether I like them or not.
{cps=50}I understand your anger, but I am not the person you should direct it towards.
{cps=50}The villages were looted and burned not by my people, but by Lord Canterbury's mercenary squad. I personally witnessed their atrocities and tried to stop the bastards.
{cps=50}I tried to stop them, but I arrived too late, and the bastards were able to get away. However, I know who is behind this, and now I have a personal issue with him.
{cps=50}When I get to him, you can be sure that he will pay in full for everything he has done. Including what he did to your people.
{cps=50}I know who they were talking about. I tried to stop them, but I arrived too late, and the villains were able to sneak away. However, I know who is behind all this, and now I have a personal issue with him.
{cps=50}I tried to avoid the killings, but war is war; and sometimes you are forced to shed blood, even when you want it the least in the world.
{cps=50}I pledged allegiance to my suzerain Earl Northampton and the King of England. And these vows oblige me...
{cps=50}Your squad is led by an old sergeant - a battered soldier who fought under the earl during the King's ill-fated Scottish campaign.
{cps=50}Despite his grumbling and an always dissatisfied look, the sergeant treats the soldiers very well and tries to make sure that everything is in order.
{cps=50}You find him doing the usual - cleaning weapons. Noticing you, he looks up inquiringly...
{cps=50}Tell about the war? Ha! As if there is something to tell really...
{cps=50}The king embarked on a big venture on the mainland - France is now weak as never before, and apparently, it is a good opportunity to chop off a fair piece of land from the frog eaters.
{cps=50}You and I, however, have nothing to be joyful about here. Yes, they pay well this time, but I strongly doubt that this war will be easy.
{cps=50}In and out. Twenty minute adventure!
{cps=50}Good money, a warm bed, and rich booty!
{cps=50}The last time I fell for these recruiters' promises, I found myself in the highlands of Scotland with holes in my shoes, a void in my stomach, and an arrow in my knee...
{cps=50}Well, we clearly got lucky with the camp - compared to what was in Scotland, here we settled down like kings.
{cps=50}The camp and the surrounding area are full of all sorts of things - you just need to keep your eyes peeled.
{cps=50}I know that many of the youth get too excited about the promised money, but - trust the old man - you shouldn't get hung up on it.
{cps=50}Do not fill your pockets with useless gold, but put money into your business - get yourself some decent equipment.
{cps=50}Iron looks much less pretty than gold, yes, but in battle, it may well save your life, while the pockets full of florins will be of little use.
{cps=50}Back home, it is the hefty purse that makes a man rich. But here, the rich man is he who is alive and in one piece. You'll learn that soon enough.
{cps=50}Why are you so worried about his fate? You ratted him out, didn't you!?
{cps=50}Well, okay, if you are scolding yourself right now, then there is no need - you did the right thing... Probably...
{cps=50}The last thing we need now is a big conflict with the allies over a small gang of thieves. Although, as a person, you have definitely stooped low...
{cps=50}Anyways, it is definitely not important anymore for the two of them now. But the third one...
{cps=50}I'm not sure that the fellow deserved such a fate, but you can hardly help him with anything. Now he is awaiting execution and will be very lucky if he simply gets his head chopped off, and not quartered or stretched out on a rack.
{cps=50}I heard that he was put in the dungeon of the Eastern Tower - the most impregnable in the entire castle. There is clearly no way out of there, even with his dexterity.
{cps=50}However, they say that the valiant guards beat him to a pulp on the first day... Won't be surprised if the poor lad has kicked the bucket already, ha-ha.
{cps=50}Ha... Although this is clearly no laughing matter... God rest his soul.
{cps=50}The earl loaded me with another errand of his...
{cps=50}Hah, it's something 'very important' again, isn't it?
{cps=50}Let me guess... He's out of wine again?
{cps=50}Nice try. But I'm afraid this time it is indeed really serious. I am in urgent need to find a good crossbowman in the camp, capable of making an accurate shot at a long distance.
{cps=50}At a very long distance.
{cps=50}Listen, lad, don't bother me with your problems - I already have enough of my own. You're the one who was told to do this - so sort it out yourself.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation check failed!
{cps=50}Hmm. We have a lot of good crossbowmen, but judging by your tone, I think you are looking for someone really special, right?
{cps=50}Bull's eye. This shot will be difficult, and there will be no second chance. I need someone I can fully rely on.
{cps=50}Yeah, it won't be easy.{w}But we are not strangers, so I will help you.
{cps=50}I will find you a marksman. Come around to see me in a couple of days and I will suggest the most suitable candidates.
{cps=50}Yeah, it won't be easy.{w}But you have proven yourself, and people respect you.
{cps=50}And therefore, so be it - I will help you.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Reputation check passed!]
{cps=50}Yeah, it won't be easy.{w}And, given your reputation, boy, there will be few people who would be willing to help you.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Reputation check passed!]
{cps=50}But well, I'll help you, but you owe me a bottle of good wine.
{cps=50}Come around to see me in a couple of days and I will suggest the most suitable candidates.
{cps=50}Well, how's the search?
{cps=50}I always keep my word, boy. Done as promised.
{cps=50}And how's my wine?
{cps=50}Here it is, just as agreed.
{cps=50}Great!
{cps=50}Damn! I forgot it in... In my other pants.
{cps=50}Well go change your pants then and come back with the wine.
{cps=50}They say that Vettori is a marksman gifted by God himself. During the last assault, he got one of the French knights through a gap in his visor... From three hundred paces of a distance!
{cps=50}If he cannot shoot this shot, then not a single person on earth can.
{cps=50}Well? Did you get it?
{cps=50}What's the matter? I thought you have already dealt with Hoggard...
{cps=50}Great. This should teach him a good lesson.
{cps=50}Now all that's left is to find a way to discreetly mix the poison into his drink.{w}But I'll take it upon myself.
{cps=50}Good job, boy. If the plan works out, then we will all owe you a little.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}Got an antidote too? Hm...
{cps=50}Fine, I'll take it. In theory, Hoggard shouldn't take a dirt nap from such a small portion of poison anyway, but it wouldn't hurt to play it safe.{w} Especially since he is, damn him, the earl's relative...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}Take these canteens. I have a bag for you; if you can't carry them in your hands - you can fit everything in it.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item recieved - Canteen.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}There is not enough space in your inventory.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item recieved - Loot bag.
{cps=50}Ha, what a stupid question! Naturally, everything depends on your physical abilities, skills, and fighting style.
{cps=50}Okay, okay, since you have never held anything sharper than a table knife in your hands, let me explain to you what is what in a nutshell.
{cps=50}No matter what they told you in childhood fairy tales about knights and their beautiful fat-assed maidens, in reality, the sword is far from the best choice on the battlefield.
{cps=50}It's a decent all-round weapon, but this very versatility makes it mediocre at everything. The sword can do everything at once, but is inferior to other weapons in any area.
{cps=50}If you are a smart fella and not a fart smella, then your choice is an axe. Those can chop the enemy into pieces so fine, you can make a stew.
{cps=50}Yes, you can't really feint with it, and, well, it requires a lot of strength, especially if you are fighting for more than a couple of minutes, but a good axe is pure power.
{cps=50}Especially in those cases when the enemy is clad in decent armor or is always hiding behind a shield, like a timid slattern.
{cps=50}Another solid option is a club or a mace - here, again, everything will depend on your strength. If it's there, then you will swing in such a way, that it would be enough for any opponent.
{cps=50}And, besides, maces are the best to knock the air out of enemies. Whack him in the ribs a couple of times, and he is already suffocating - you can take him while he is weak!
{cps=50}And finally, the best option is spears. They are perfect to keep the enemies at a comfortable distance, good to deceive them with feints, and excellent at making Swiss cheese out of your foe until he gets tired and decides that he has had enough...
{cps=50}How do I behave in battle to survive?
{cps=50}Hmm, the first thing you need to remember is caution. Generally, you need to hurry only in two cases in life: when you want to get to the tavern before closing and when you're caught short. None of it, as you might guess, has anything to do with war.
{cps=50}Make it a rule to carefully study your opponent before you act. Do not immediately rush at him - first assess the situation. Look what he is armed with, what he is wearing, how he behaves in battle.
{cps=50}Try to find his vulnerabilities and only then take the risk.
{cps=50}Defensive action will be a good strategy against most opponents. If the enemy is aggressive, stay cool and let him swing all he wants.
{cps=50}Use feints, knock him down with your shield, and kick his ass when you get the opportunity.
{cps=50}Sooner or later he will get tired and when this happens, you will crush him.
{cps=50}However, do not forget that war is not a knightly tournament, but a cruel meat grinder. There are no rules, no honor, and the main task here is just to survive.
{cps=50}Do not be a coward but don't ask for trouble. Soberly assess your strength and the strength of the enemy - and, I am sure, lady luck will smile upon you.
{cps=50}As the sergeant promised, you were able to find Vettori relatively easily. You recognized him by his obvious Mediterranean appearance that stood out among pasty white people of Lord Sunderland.
{cps=50}Thanks to your reputation, you quickly got along and Vettori agreed to help.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Reputation check passed!]
{cps=50}However, there is one 'but'.
{cps=50}According to him, in order to make such a shot, he will need a fairly good quality crossbow, but his personal one just broke down yesterday and is still being repaired.
{cps=50}Therefore, you will have to get a good crossbow, from which you could shoot at such a distance.
{cps=50}Due to your poor reputation, Vettori is very reluctant to do business with you.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Reputation check failed!]
{cps=50}According to him, in order to make such a shot, he will need a fairly good quality crossbow, but his personal one broke down just yesterday and, apparently, for good this time.
{cps=50}Therefore, he agrees to help you, but only if you get a decent crossbow for him, which he can then keep for himself.
{cps=50}When you show Vettori the crossbow you obtained, he immediately shakes his head, saying that a light crossbow will definitely not work and that it won't be able to shoot such a shot even in theory.
{cps=50}When you show Vettori the crossbow you obtained, he nods approvingly and says that this one will definitely do.
{cps=50}After handing him the crossbow, you arrange to meet in the morning at the Falcon Tower. Saying goodbye, Vettori notes that it would be a good idea to craft a poisoned bolt to ensure death if it hits the target.
{cps=50}He has suitable quarrelheads, but you will have to make the poison yourself.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item recieved - Winged Quarrelhead.
{cps=50}{cps=50}Vettori adds that, of course, it would be possible to hit the target even with ordinary bolts, but there are significantly more chances with custom ones. It's up to you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough space for the quarrelhead!
{cps=50}Vettori adds that, of course, it would be possible to hit the target even with ordinary bolts, but there are significantly more chances with custom ones. It's up to you.
{cps=50}Hope it's something important...
{cps=50}I got what you asked for. Here are several bottles of excellent French wine from one of the local chateaux.
{cps=50}Great job, my boy. I saw you for the second time in my life, but for some reason I felt that I could definitely rely on you... And, as you can see, I was not mistaken.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) increased by 10!
{cps=50}I'll be honest, I hate fools who cannot be entrusted with anything at all. But, as it usually turns out, these fools make up the majority around here.
{cps=50}It's nice to see that you've got a head on your shoulders. I will remember you in case I suddenly need a reliable person.
{cps=50}And this is for your work.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+35 Florins!
{cps=50}Now piss off.
{cps=50}Really!? Got something decent? If you try to slip me that sour shit that the soldiers drink, I will pour it over your head.
{cps=50}I'm... In the process of searching.
{cps=50}Then why the hell are you bothering me over trifles!?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You and the earl have nothing to talk about at the moment.
{cps=50}Impressed by your service and accomplishments, the earl has decided to promote you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You have been promoted to Man-at-arms.

{cps=50}Welcome to the war!
{cps=50}Very soon you will have to shed your first blood, however, before you can do this, you should get familiar with the basic principles of the Heads Will Roll combat system.
{cps=50}Heads Will Roll uses a turn-based combat system. All characters participating in the battle take turns in the following order: you, your allies, your opponents.
{cps=50}The order never changes. A character can skip his turn only in one case - if the 'stunned' effect was applied to him.
{cps=50}At the beginning of each turn, the player has a choice of several actions - all of them are listed on the character control panel in the lower right corner.
{cps=50}Let's take a look at the available actions.
{cps=50}Attack.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for attacking with your main weapon. By clicking on it, the menu for selecting the target is first called up, then the menu for selecting the available strikes, and then the menu for selecting the part of the enemy's body that will be attacked.
{cps=50}You can get detailed information about the various available strikes and their properties by hovering over their respectable icons.
{cps=50}Please note that many weapons have different available attacks. There are differences not only between weapon classes, but sometimes also within the classes themselves, which makes different types of weapons more or less suitable for different styles of play and fights with different opponents.
{cps=50}Similarly, you can click on the dice icon in the body parts selection menu. It will call up a help menu with more detailed information about the damage that your attack can inflict, as well as the chance to hit the target and to penetrate its armor.
{cps=50}The accuracy of the main weapon's attacks depends on many different stats of the attacker and the defender - Agility, Weapon skill, Weapon length, and Fatigue level.{vspace=5}Please note that Agility plays a bigger role in defense, while Weapon Skill - in offense.
{cps=50}If a character has a shield, he receives an additional level of protection. That means that during the attack, the game will first determine whether the attacker managed to hit the target at all, then - whether the blow was blocked by a shield, and last but not least - whether the blow fell on a protected or unprotected part of the body. The chance to block a blow with a shield depends on the characteristics of the shield itself.
{cps=50}For the defender, the current amount of Stamina is also a fundamentally important indicator - the more there is, the higher the chance to dodge an attack.
{cps=50}In addition, the stances, equipped trinkets, and injuries can have a significant impact on the course of the battle, but more on them later.
{cps=50}Feint.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for feints with your main weapon.
{cps=50}Feint is a deceptive action designed to distract and confuse the enemy. During the battle, feints can be used to weaken your opponent - a successful feint lowers the opponent's Stamina amount, and also inflicts a debuff on them.
{cps=50}The success of the feint will depend on your Agility and Weapon skill, as well as the corresponding stats of your opponent.
{cps=50}Shield.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for the shield attacks (if you have a shield).
{cps=50}Shield attacks work on a principle similar to feints, however, their success depends on Strength, instead of Agility.
{cps=50}A successful shield attack can inflict the 'Stunned' debuff on the enemy, causing them to skip their next turn.
{cps=50}Crossbow.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for the crossbow shooting (if you have a crossbow).
{cps=50}Crossbow shooting functions in much the same way as attacks with melee weapons. However, the crossbow takes into account a slightly smaller number of variables, and the success of the shot mainly depends on the shooter's Crossbow Skill.
{cps=50}Keep in mind, that after each shot from the crossbow it will need to be reloaded with a special item. For example - Crossbow Reloading Tool.
{cps=50}Stances.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for switching stances.
{cps=50}There are three stances available to the player - Offensive stance, Defensive stance and Balanced stance.
{cps=50}Offensive stance will give bonuses for melee attacks, but reduce the chances of dodging an enemy attack or successfully blocking a blow with a shield.{vspace=5}The size of the bonus received from this stance will depend on the Weapon Skill.
{cps=50}Defensive stance increases the chances of dodging an enemy attack, as well as blocking an enemy blow with a shield, but it also negatively affects the success of your attacks.{vspace=5}The amount of the bonus received from this stance will depend on the Agility.
{cps=50}Balanced stance is a compromise between the two. This stance does not provide any bonuses or debuffs.
{cps=50}Recover.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for restoring Stamina. The efficiency of Recover and the amount of Stamina recovered depends on the amount of Coordination.
{cps=50}Items.{vspace=5}This button brings up a list of active items available to the player for use. It can be bandages and other medicines, antidotes, flasks, etc.
{cps=50}The general list of items (including crossbow ammunition) that will be available to the character during battle can be found by clicking on the Pouch button. It is located on the bottom left and displays the contents of your bag.
{cps=50}Respite.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for lowering the level of Fatigue in battle. The general principles of Respite are similar to those of Recover. Coordination also affects the success of this action.
{cps=50}In the center of the bottom panel there is an icon with the image of the main character. It is surrounded by six squares that will show certain items from your equipment.
{cps=50}The left column will contain (from top to bottom) a weapon, a helmet, and armor. On the right, there are three trinkets worn by the main character.
{cps=50}Trinkets are special items with unusual properties that will enhance the main character in different ways or give him some additional abilities.
{cps=50}Also, directly above the image of the main character there will be an image of a shield (in case you have a shield). All seven listed buttons call up the corresponding menus, where you can get more detailed information about each of the items.
{cps=50}To the left, above the Pouch button, is the Stats button, which brings up the character stats menu. Here you can get more detailed information about each of the main character's attributes, as well as see a list of active effects and injuries.
{cps=50}Injuries and active effects will also be displayed in the bottom bar above Health and Stamina. By opening the Stats menu, you can get more information about each of them.
{cps=50}Information about your opponent will be located in the upper right part of the screen. By clicking on the icon with the image of his face, you can also call up a detailed menu that will contain various details about the enemy - his stats, weapons, and equipment.
{cps=50}The last important detail to touch upon is Injuries.
{cps=50}You and your opponent can attack each other on different parts of the body, which have different damage multipliers, different armor, and coverage (depending on the items worn), as well as different injuries associated with them.
{cps=50}So, for example, successful hits on Limbs can cause a broken leg or cut the arm muscles, which will lead to a decrease in Agility or Weapon skill, respectively.
{cps=50}The severity of the negative consequences caused by each of the injuries will depend on the amount of Strength of the attacker.
{cps=50}Please note that for the player most injuries will have a permanent effect until they are healed in the camp.
{cps=50}You can get more detailed information about the combat system of the game in the help menu.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Welcome to Нeads Will Roll!{vspace=25}Soon you will embark on your first adventure, but before you do it - we have to warn you: not all risks are worth taking and not all fights are worth fighting.{vspace=5}Blindly charging forward without considering the circumstances and consequences is the fastest way to get yourself killed.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Нeads Will Roll will try to present the player with a lot of difficult choices, but your answers will never be right or wrong. There is always something to lose and something to gain, no matter the choice. A good strategy for success is to approach the adventures with the intent to simply survive rather than become a hero.{vspace=5}Don't go on dangerous endeavours if you're not confident in your success, as you may be severely punished for unpreparedness.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Some quests will fail, some characters you meet will grow to hate or despise you, and sometimes you will have to flee from a battle in order to save your life. Don't let these things bother you too much, as your real goal is to make it to the very end in one piece.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And last but not least - remember to keep track of time. Training, shopping, adventuring, and completing quests will all consume it. Neglect one too much in favor of the others - and you're in for unpleasant surprises.
{cps=50}Welcome to Rennes!{vspace=5}The surrounding territories of the city are being held by squads of mercenaries who can try to take over Rennes if they feel the advantage is on their side.
{cps=50}Your main goal is to prevent the fall of the city, otherwise you will have to flee.
{cps=50}By completing various tasks, as well as defeating mercenaries in random skirmishes, you can weaken their forces and strengthen the city's defenses.
{cps=50}According to the scouts' reports, the mercenaries, angered by your actions, are gathering forces for a full-fledged attack on the city...
{cps=50}Tutorial - Prepare for Battle{vspace=35}During the 'Prepare for Battle' phase you are able to make the last minute preparations before entering combat.
{cps=50}Apart from managing your inventory and equipment, this phase also allows you to use various consumable items (Camp consumable items) like Medicine, Canteen, Waterskin, and some others.
{cps=50}During battle, Canteen and Waterskin are used to recover your Stamina. However, during the 'Prepare for Battle' phase, they will lower your Fatigue level (Stamina will recover automatically). You can use this to gain an advantage during prolonged battles with several combat encounters.
{cps=50}Also don't forget that here you can reload your crossbow, swap Trinkets, or refill your pouch with new ammunition and consumables.
{cps=50}After spending about a week at Castle Dunkirk, the army eventually begins its march to the southwest.
{cps=50}Leaning over your dying friend, you hear his last request - he asks you to find his mother and sister at home in England and tell them how he died.
{cps=50}Having heard your promise, Bartholomew dies.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [bad_news_travel_slowly.name]!
{cps=50}Bartholomew is also among those who will have to take on the dirtiest job...
{cps=50}Having done enough during previous assaults, you concede this opportunity to others. Moreover, Bartholomew himself, annoyed by the fact that he almost did not take part in the previous assault, is not at all opposed to going in the forefront this time.
{cps=50}And this would be the last time you see him...
{cps=50}Despite the earl's attempts to hold you back, you go in the first wave - next to your friend, because you cannot sit and wait while your comrades risk their lives and shed their blood.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) improved by 15!{vspace=5}Reputation (the earl) decreased by 3!
{cps=50}One of the arrows hits you too, leaving a shallow but very painful wound.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Agility check failed!]{vspace=5}Health lowered by 5!
{cps=50}Bursting into the city through the destroyed wall, you immediately start pushing the defenders back, almost forcing them to flee, when suddenly a knight appears behind the French soldiers and quickly gives them orders.
{cps=50}Under his command, French soldiers who have just fought in a messy heap immediately reorganize into a single wall of shields and confidently repel attack after attack...
{cps=50}In about half an hour a messenger reports that the south wall is almost taken, but the first wave of the attackers is bogged down in street fighting and needs support.
{cps=50}The second wave is now headed to the south wall, led by the Prince himself. Who received the simplest instructions from the King - to return either victorious or dead.
{cps=50}The first wave is met with a huge avalanche of arrows and bolts from the fortress walls, hitting every other soldier that rushes towards them.
{cps=50}Under his command, French soldiers who have just fought in a messy heap immediately reorganize into a single wall of shields and confidently repel attack after attack ...
{cps=50}Having finally distinguished friends from foes, you immediately join the battle.
{cps=50}{cps=50}In a fierce battle, Lord Canterbury's men, with your help, overwhelm the French.
{cps=50}The situation is changing. The battle might be soon coming to an end.
{cps=50}In a fierce battle, Lord Canterbury's men, with your help, overwhelm the French.
{cps=50}The chaotic battle in the forest dies down as suddenly as it began.
{cps=50}Just a few moments ago, you were in the thick of the battle, fighting furiously, and now suddenly everything is quiet.
{cps=50}Trying to find at least someone familiar, you awkwardly wander back and forth, stumbling over tree roots and dead bodies.
{cps=50}After some time you come across a large group of people, who are encircling someone's body lying on the ground.
{cps=50}In one of these figures you recognize the prince, standing a little further away from everyone with a bloody sword in his hand and a devastated gaze. He doesn't look like himself at all.
{cps=50}You also recognize the earl in another figure: he bends over the dead man, whose face you still cannot see.
{cps=50}They are almost entirely surrounded by knights, lords, and their bodyguards - some of them are still breathing heavily, and many have blood dripping from weapons and armor.
{cps=50}You don't understand what exactly is happening, but do not dare to break the silence in the presence of many such noble persons.
{cps=50}But fortunately you don't have to wait long...
{cps=50}The silence is finally interrupted by the earl.
{cps=50}Standing up and turning to the prince, he lifts his sword into the air and says loudly:...
{cps=50}'The king is dead.{w} Long live the king!'
{cps=50}After a moment's hesitation, the crowd surrounding them follows his example, and their shouts echo throughout the area.
{cps=50}The opportunity to get a full picture of what exactly happened on the hunt is given to you only after some time, when the earl bothers to retell you what happened in a nutshell.
{cps=50}The opportunity to get a full picture of what exactly happened on the hunt is given to you only after some time, as a single puzzle is gradually formed from numerous rumors, contradictory eyewitness accounts, and scraps of overheard conversations.
{cps=50}As it turns out, the peace negotiations were just a ruse of the French king, who plotted to try and kill the entire leadership of the English army and, above all, King Edward, with a dirty trick.
{cps=50}Some kind of poison was mixed into the wine that the English were so kindly given on the hunt, but, fortunately, it did not work properly.
{cps=50}This, however, did not stop them and, seizing the opportunity, the French drew their swords and attacked the king.
{cps=50}Further events do not need a special explanation, since all those present were witnesses. Even if it wasn't possible to save Edward's life, the Prince, as well as most of the leadership of the army, fortunately survived, which means that John did not achieve his goal...
{cps=50}Now the leadership of the army was split into two practically irreconcilable camps: some, led by the Lords Canterbury and Sunderland, demanded revenge for Edward's murder and the continuation of the war to a victorious end. Others, led by the earl, advocated the conclusion of peace.
{cps=50}At first glance, their position might have seemed cowardly, and Lord Canterbury didn't hesitate to point that out at every opportunity. But everything was not that simple.
{cps=50}According to the earl himself, they sought to make peace with the French not out of cowardice or excessive friendliness, but because it wasn't even John who was the real enemy of the English crown in their opinion.
{cps=50}A decent number of clues indicated that it was not the French who were behind the death of Edward... but the mercenaries of Lord Canterbury.
{cps=50}This, in particular, was evident because de Roche, who once again emerged unharmed from the forest meat grinder, hastened to personally meet with the earl and the prince after the unfortunate incident.
{cps=50}Responsible for all royal mercenaries, Lord Canterbury controlled the huge financial flows that the crown spent on paying their wages. But he has also been occupying one of the key positions in the army and thus had the right to a significant part of any war trophies.
{cps=50}Thus, having done a little math, it was easy to see that such a timely death of the king, who was about to sign peace with the French, was really beneficial to the lord.
{cps=50}The Prince spent several days in countless councils with the lords and exchanged several dozen messengers with the French, after which he made a decision.
{cps=50}A decision to make peace.
{cps=50}Many people were upset by this turn of events, however, despite all the efforts of Lord Canterbury's supporters, they were not able to provoke mass discontent in the army.
{cps=50}Tired of mostly unsuccessful hostilities, the soldiers were not too eager to continue fighting and were happy to return home - even under such circumstances.
{cps=50}Hearing about the conclusion of peace, Lord Canterbury, disregarding the subordination, left the army and immediately departed for England with a small detachment of his people.
{cps=50}Sensing danger, Prince Edward hastily concluded all of his affairs on the continent - dismissed mercenaries and handed over what remained of the army to Thomas Marshall, whom he instructed to return the men home as soon as possible.
{cps=50}After that, the prince, accompanied by his closest retinue and Earl Northampton, rushed back to England.
{cps=50}Having proved yourself to the earl and the prince during the campaign, you receive an offer to go with the prince to England to help him get his rightful throne and to continue serving as a full-fledged squire at the earl's court.
{cps=50}Considering the urgency of the situation, you have to give up all your affairs and go immediately without even saying goodbye to the numerous acquaintances you have managed to make.
{cps=50}The only one you have time to say goodbye to is your good friend Bartholomew, with whom you went shoulder to shoulder through the entire campaign.
{cps=50}Praising you for your choice and predicting a great future for you in the capital, he, nevertheless, is clearly upset that your paths diverge, and makes you promise him that you will definitely come to visit one day.
{cps=50}When asked about his own plans, Bartholomew — now a hero of the final assault on Cambrai, rewarded by the king himself — replies that he's already got everything figured out. He's going to buy a small estate on the lower reaches of the Thames, get a wife, kids, and a bunch of voluptuous maids — to help him around the house, listen to his war stories, and keep the drinks on ice.
{cps=50}When you ask him what he's going to do after the war — Bartholomew evasively replies that even though he didn't manage to get rich through his military career, he's already come up with a couple of 'schemes' of how to fix this situation once he's back home.
{cps=50}Exchanging farewells, you shake each other's hands and promise to meet again.
{cps=50}On this note, the friends' paths diverge as the war comes to a conclusion — and with it, your stay in France.
{cps=50}This concludes your stay in France, as the war between the two kingdoms started by Edward III is coming to an end.
{cps=50}After a brief but careful consideration you decide to turn down the offer as you have no desire to be dragged into the capital's whirlpool of intrigues and conspiracies.
{cps=50}Clearly disappointed by your decision, Northampton and Prince Edward however immediately accept it, making no attempts to change your mind. Having thanked you for your service, they — now for the last time — bid you farewell.
{cps=50}With the king dead and Canterbury, Northampton, and Prince Edward now gone, the discipline in what remained of the English army took a serious change for the worse. Bands of mercenaries, assembled for this campaign with prospects of generous war spoils, all of a sudden found themselves without a leader and without a war — but with a bunch of unfulfilled promises instead. Considering themselves betrayed and lied to, they started deserting the army en masse — flooding the neighbouring regions and spreading a wildfire of small-scale wars and skirmishes all around this part of the kingdom.
{cps=50}Thomas Marshall, left in charge of the army and unburdened with considerations regarding the well-being of France, decided to simply ignore the 'departure' of mercenaries and concentrated his thoughts on getting the remains of the forces, first, to Dunkirk and then, by sea, back home.
{cps=50}The mysterious death of the king, followed by an abrupt conclusion to the war with England pretty much abandoning all of its continental allies, brought a collapse to the pre-war alliance. This resulted in the Flemish fleet refusing to aid in ferrying Thomas Marshall's forces back to the island, leaving this job to the much smaller and battered English fleet.
{cps=50}Thus, the forces had to be returned home in very small portions with many soldiers forced to spend the winter in Dunkirk while awaiting their turn to go home. You also turned out to be one of those men. By that point, the supplies were all but gone and you were pretty much left to survive on your own.
{cps=50}It was during this miserable time that you and your comrades were approached by a recruiter with an offer to try yourselves as mercenaries in service of Duke de Monfort.
{cps=50}A promise of a regular salary and food on the table was a stark contrast to the harsh reality of starving yourself to death in wait for a ship that — for all you knew — might never even come. This opportunity seems like the one you wouldn't want to miss.
{cps=50}But not everyone has the same idea. Among the comrades who have not yet departed for home is Bartholomew. He is in no hurry to go to a new war and at first tries to dissuade you, however, seeing that you already have pretty much made up your mind, he gives up his attempts to stop you.
{cps=50}Saddened that your paths diverge, he makes you promise that you will stay alive and will definitely come to visit him one day.
{cps=50}Leaving friends behind, you lead a small band of volunteers to Brittany — towards a new adventure.
{cps=50}Leaving Dunkirk behind, you lead a small band of volunteers to Brittany — towards a new adventure.
{cps=50}After that, the Prince, accompanied by Earl Northampton and the rest of his inner circle, rushed back to England.
{cps=50}With the departure of Lord Canterbury first, and then of the Prince, the situation in the English camp is rapidly changing. Detachments of mercenaries, suddenly left without a commander, without a war, and also with only a small salary instead of the promised generous reward, refuse to obey Thomas Marshall and disperse without permission - in some places even skirmishing with their yesterday's allies.
{cps=50}The death of de Roche by your sword canceled out the possibility of a peaceful outcome of the meeting of the two armies at Cambrai.
{cps=50}In King Edward's opinion, this essentially lost military campaign could still be saved - with one decisive battle in which the French army would be utterly defeated.
{cps=50}Having lost his army, John will have no choice but to ask for peace on almost any terms. And according to the plan of the English crown, there would be a lot of terms. More than enough to compensate for all the months of sitting under Cambrai's walls and for the unsuccessful campaign of Thomas Marshall as well.
{cps=50}As a result, it was decided to extend the almost finished war for exactly one victorious battle, which will rewrite its entire history.
{cps=50}As to what was happening at that time in the camp of the French king - you did not know. A few hours after the death of de Roche, rumors spread that the French barons were scattering, leaving the king to fight off the English by himself.
{cps=50}And indeed, you personally witnessed some kind of resurgence and movement in John's camp while watching it from the fortress walls.
{cps=50}However, a few days passed, but the French army did not thin out. The assassination of de Roche has definitely dealt a blow to it, but it clearly affected mostly the morale and fighting spirit rather than the numbers of the French.
{cps=50}The general jubilation that prevailed among the English soldiers after de Roche's death soon turned into a concern.
{cps=50}Unlike the fresh French soldiers, who have just arrived, Edward's army had already fought for several months. The realization that now we had to fight with a fresh enemy did not help boost the spirit of the troops at all.
{cps=50}On the third day, when it became clear to Edward that the enemy army wasn't going anywhere, whilst his own army was rapidly losing morale, the king finally decided not to wait any longer and attack now.
{cps=50}The English command plans to fight outside the city and, since no one wants another several months long siege, the French do not interfere with Edward's withdrawal and formation of his troops.
{cps=50}This detail also immediately negatively affects the morale of the soldiers. Seeing that the enemy not only does not give up, but on the contrary, behaves so confidently and defiantly, many begin to suspect that something is going wrong.
{cps=50}Since the command thinks that the main threat in battle will arise from the attacks of the heavy cavalry, the infantry hastily builds defensive positions - earthen embankments, as well as stakes stuck in the ground.
{cps=50}Thanks to your physical strength and skill, things are going well, and soon impressive fortifications appear in front of your position.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Strength|Crafting check passed!]
{cps=50}However, due to a lack of strength and physical labor skills, things are not going very well. And you have managed to build only a pathetic semblance of fortifications in front of your position.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Strength|Crafting check failed!]{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}You spend the night before the battle already positioned. Although you are trying to rest, you cannot fight off intrusive thoughts, and instead of sleeping, you again and again replay de Roche's murder and Eva's words in your head.
{cps=50}At that moment, there was only duty in front of you. Service to the English crown, responsibility to the earl, the prince, and your comrades, which outweighed everything else in the world.
{cps=50}But what happened no longer seems so unambiguous to you now. You are becoming increasingly aware that in that situation you had a real choice.
{cps=50}And you made a mistake by choosing wrong.
{cps=50}Bartholomew also adds to the sadness and anxiousness, grumbling to you for days about some kind of foreboding.
{cps=50}In this bleak atmosphere you meet the dawn of the most difficult day in your life.
{cps=50}The battle begins with a sluggish archery skirmish.
{cps=50}Due to the wooded and uneven terrain around Cambrai, you don't really understand what's going on.
{cps=50}Lines of yeomen lined up behind you send arrows, volley after volley, somewhere in the direction of the French hordes visible in the distance.
{cps=50}Enemy's arrows also reach you from time to time. At first, only a few inaccurate ones do, causing only laughter. But after a quarter of an hour, when the intensity of the shooting increases, your formation starts thinning out, and the wounded and dead cover the ground around you, the sneer gives way to terror.
{cps=50}The situation changes drastically when an avalanche of French knights suddenly appears from behind a distant hill and rushes straight to your position.
{cps=50}The yeomen immediately focus their fire on them and seriously damage the attackers, but about half of the knights still manage to reach you.
{cps=50}However, the fortifications you built prevent the French from breaking into your formation.
{cps=50}Seeing that the attack of the knights is bogged down and many of them have lost their horses, the sergeant raises you in a counterattack.
{cps=50}The fortifications that you've built work, slowing down the French and preventing them from powerfully wedging into your lines, however, they do not do much harm.
{cps=50}The knights, although knocked down from their horses and seriously outnumbered, continue to fight desperately and only with great efforts do you manage to get the upper hand over them.
{cps=50}The attack of the French cavalry is completely stopped, but at what cost... Looking around, you cannot find many of your comrades, and the ground under your feet is strewn with dozens of bodies.
{cps=50}You recognize Bartholomew in one of them.
{cps=50}It seems that the poor fellow was afraid not without a reason.
{cps=50}With the grief and devastation comes another thought - very predictable, but no less inevitable.
{cps=50}It's all your fault.
{cps=50}For better or for worse, you do not have time to grieve - the French are launching a new attack.
{cps=50}This time the infantry advances in a dense formation.
{cps=50}The English archers, scared away by the cavalry, have already retreated, leaving you to defend your position alone.
{cps=50}Gathering all the survivors, the sergeant orders to hold on to the last.
{cps=50}You are fighting at the limit of your capabilities, but the forces are too unequal. The fresher and larger detachment of the French simply squeezes you out of fortified positions.
{cps=50}Of course, there can be no organized retreat. The catastrophe comes spontaneously, with the flight of a handful of soldiers - exhausted by the heavy battle and surrounded by the French who came from the flank.
{cps=50}The two running fighters are joined by a third, followed by a fourth and a fifth, and so on. The firm defensive lines began to crumble like a card house, and what just a few moments ago was a few fleeing people now turned into a mass retreat.
{cps=50}You don't even need to convince yourself that considering the catastrophic situation around you, joining the retreating soldiers is the only option left.
{cps=50}You run for your life, leaving behind the sergeant and a few other brave fighters who have not abandoned the defense.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 15!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}In an effort to complete your defeat, the French set out in pursuit of the retreating. Both sides pretty much fizzled out during the fight, and therefore from a sprint this race quickly turns into a marathon.
{cps=50}Thanks to your impressive endurance, you easily break away from your pursuers and safely escape with other survivors.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Endurance check passed!]
{cps=50}This concludes the battle for you. You find shelter inside the city walls, where hundreds of other retreating soldiers are already flocking from all sides.
{cps=50}Seeing this picture, you can guess about the outcome of the battle of the two armies.
{cps=50}In the following hours, more and more groups of warriors, militias, yeomen and rare companies of knights led by lords, arrive in the city in an endless stream. The field of the recent battle, which is clearly visible from the fortress towers, is completely left to the French, who are actively plundering a small part of the convoy taken outside the city walls.
{cps=50}Your worst fears are confirmed in the late afternoon when the prince with his small retinue of knights, the earl, and Lords Canterbury and Sunderland return to Cambrai accompanying a covered wagon decorated with the French royal coat of arms.
{cps=50}Rumors that King Edward is in that wagon, heavily wounded in battle and now barely clinging to life, immediately spread throughout the city.
{cps=50}And closer to midnight, when you are on guard on one of the fortress walls, watching the celebration in John's camp, the bells of the city churches, one by one, start to toll. Marking an end to the life of another English monarch.
{cps=50}For whom the bell tolls?
{cps=50}For King Edward? For de Roche? For the sergeant who was left alone to defend himself? For missing Bartholomew? Or perhaps for heartbroken Eva?
{cps=50}For King Edward? For de Roche? For the sergeant who was left alone to defend himself? Or perhaps for heartbroken Eva?
{cps=50}Does it mourn the defeat of the English or proudly declare the victory of the French?
{cps=50}Standing alone on the cold fortress wall separating the two camps, you suddenly realize that it tolls for you.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}......{vspace=5}{w}...
{cps=50}Further events are developing quite rapidly.
{cps=50}The prince saw no further point in continuing the war and was much more concerned about an early return to England, in order to officially take the throne and avoid a potential crisis of power.
{cps=50}But not everyone supported him. The leadership of the English army was quickly split into two irreconcilable camps with a clearly defined 'war party' - a group of influential commanders led by Lords Canterbury and Sunderland, who demanded bloody revenge for Edward and the continuation of the war to a victorious end.
{cps=50}To avoid an even deeper split, the prince spent several days trying to maneuver between different approaches. However, after countless councils with the lords and the exchange of several dozen messengers with the French, he made a decision. A decision to make peace.
{cps=50}Hearing about the conclusion of peace, Lord Canterbury, disregarding the subordination, left the army and, with a small detachment of his people, immediately departed for England.
{cps=50}Despite the fact that the battle is almost lost, you, as well as a few other brave soldiers, refuse to retreat, fighting to the end.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}The sergeant, heavily bleeding, continues to hold the defense, standing by your side.
{cps=50}Receiving another wound, he sinks to the ground, living out the last moments of his life.
{cps=50}Looking around at the few of his people who are still holding the line, he calls you.
{cps=50}Handing out his sword to you, he manages to utter a single phrase.
{cps=50}Only in death does duty end.
{cps=50}You don't have time to put your weapon to use, as you lose consciousness from a powerful blow from behind. Falling to the ground stunned, you become the enemy's catch.
{cps=50}You spend the next month being held captive by the French in almost complete isolation from any news whatsoever.
{cps=50}Only a few days after the battle, you learn that King Edward was killed, and the English army was utterly defeated and fled back to Cambrai.
{cps=50}According to numerous and contradictory rumors that gradually flooded the French camp in the following weeks, a mercenary revolt led by several lords took place in the English camp shortly after the defeat and death of the king. Because of that, the Prince, who even before that had no intentions to continue the war, was now forced to seek peace with the French on any terms. And after signing the treaty, he hastily departed back to England to try to retain the throne.
{cps=50}To show his generosity, John agreed to release all the prisoners, but on the condition that the English side would pay for their transportation back across the English Channel.
{cps=50}That way, after about a month in prison, you were released. Moreover, due to your status, you even managed to keep a significant amount of your belongings.
{cps=50}However, the harsh conditions of imprisonment still affected your health, and very heavily.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}All stats lowered by 1!
{cps=50}After joining the remnants of the English army under the command of Thomas Marshall, you head back to Dunkirk. On the way you witness the demarche of the last mercenary detachments, who, ignoring the superiors' orders, are massively deserting and scattering around the area.
{cps=50}Marshall prefers to turn a blind eye to this and brings the troops, loyal to the crown, back to Dunkirk, from where the army is bit by bit being evacuated home by ships.
{cps=50}Leaving your friends behind, you, at the head of a small detachment of volunteers, go to Brittany - towards the new adventure.
{cps=50}After several days of travel on a ship chartered by recruiters, you arrive by sea in the Breton city of Rennes.
{cps=50}According to sailors, for the longest time it was the richest city in the entire northern France, but recently things have not been going well here.
{cps=50}After disembarking at the port, you leave your squad to unload and go straight to an audience with the duke, under whose banners you will soon stand.
{cps=50}Walking along the city streets full of life, you take a close look at what is happening around you, hoping to feel the local atmosphere.
{cps=50}Your attention is immediately drawn to a fair number of armed people (both soldiers and civilians), the widespread fortification work, as well as a huge stir around any food shops.
{cps=50}Even with your little military experience, you realize that this is a very dangerous combination. When food begins to run short and people have swords and axes in their hands, only bad things could happen.
{cps=50}After reaching the upper city, you wander in its labyrinths for some time and, looking for help, ask one of the guards for directions.
{cps=50}Hearing that you have come to meet the duke, who should be expecting the arrival of your squad, he raises his eyebrows in surprise and remarks with amusement that the duke is not expecting anyone for sure. Because he's dead.
{cps=50}He brushes your inquiries aside and escorts you to the residence...
{cps=50}In the ducal chambers, where you, after a meticulous study of your documents, were brought by the servants, you are greeted by a young woman.
{cps=50}Although, you can't really call it a greeting. Short-haired and dressed in armor, she sits at the head of a large table littered with maps, plans, letters, and documents. Propping up her head with a hand, she looks off into the distance with an absent expression.
{cps=50}Your appearance pulls her out of the swamp of her own thoughts...
{cps=50}If you, bastard, have brought me bad news again, then you better run right away, for I swear I will chop off your useless head with my own sword!
{cps=50}I'm afraid I'm not who you think I am. My name is [name] - I arrived here at the head of the squad of soldiers recruited in Dunkirk to serve under the banner of the Duke de Montfort.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She froze for a second, but then her facial expression immediately changed.
{cps=50}Finally! Long-awaited reinforcements. My dumb-ass husband managed to do at least something right before he died!
{cps=50}God rest his soul...
{cps=50}Forgive me this scene - I can barely control myself. I am surrounded by complete idiots and fools, because of whom I have already lost my peace, sleep, and several hundred thousand florins.
{cps=50}And if this continues, then soon I will be left first without a city, and then, most likely, without a head.
{cps=50}Unfortunately, I don't quite understand what's going on...
{cps=50}Oh, so the recruiters didn't explain anything? Ha, why am I not surprised at all? This is quite in the organizational style of my husband. It's amazing that they were able to send you to the correct address.
{cps=50}Knowing how he and his people do business, I would not be surprised if instead of Brittany, you were sent to Britannia...
{cps=50}...or to Reims instead of Rennes.
{cps=50}...or...
{cps=50}I think I understood the analogy. So what's going on?
{cps=50}What's going on? Oh, I'll tell you what's going on. His late Majesty the Duke de Montfort decided for no apparent reason that his lords, managing the surrounding farms, had too much extra money and decided, so to speak, to shake them a little.
{cps=50}We thought... Or more precisely, he thought that they would make concessions if they were scared.
{cps=50}But these bastards, instead of just paying us, hired those rogue mercenaries, who flooded everything here after the war in Flanders was over.
{cps=50}As a result, when the duke with a small force went to one of the farms to collect the money, the mercenaries ambushed and killed them. And overnight I lost not only half of all the soldiers who were supposed to guard my city, but also Froissard, the head of the guard and the only proper warrior in Rennes.
{cps=50}Oh, well, my husband too... Although I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing. God rest his soul.
{cps=50}So what about the mercenaries?
{cps=50}I suggested that we just forget about everything like it never happened, but Onar, who is now at the head of the lords, apparently promised them not only money as a reward but also the city to plunder.
{cps=50}Of course, they have no guts to storm the fortress walls, so for now these filthy dogs have settled down on the surrounding farms, cutting off the city supplies. They plan to starve us out.
{cps=50}Do you think they are able to do it?
{cps=50}All this has been dragging on for more than a month - there was an abundance of supplies in the city, but now they are slowly evaporating. I arranged a sea supply route with the merchants, but it's expensive. And I won't be able to feed the whole city for long like this...
{cps=50}There is still time, of course, but it's running out.
{cps=50}Why aren't your troops doing anything? Your city is full of armed men.
{cps=50}Ha. I really have a lot of armed men, but they are no soldiers. The dirty-ass peasants with daggers, spears, and log cleavers won't be able to do much. And all my knights, to hell with them, quarreled among themselves and are now too busy with intrigues and settling personal issues...
{cps=50}Intrigues? In a city that is about to be occupied?
{cps=50}You don't seem to understand. It wasn't only the head of the guard, Froissart, who got into that ambush along with the duke - everyone perished there: Seneschal de Allard, Anjou - chief constable, captain of the militia de Xaintrailles, both weaponsmiths - Barbeau and Aucler, and half of the sergeants.
{cps=50}And now, my wonderful knights, or rather, remaining knights, enthusiastically share the vacated posts, taking advantage of the fact that I do not have enough power and authority to keep them in check.
{cps=50}And all that's left for me is to sit here for days, listening to empty reports and coming up with useless plans for an offensive, into which we will go as soon as we deal with the personnel issue.
{cps=50}Although, we might not go at all. Dupont, my new head of the guard, for example, told me yesterday that the mercenary threat was 'grossly overrated.'
{cps=50}To hell with all of them.
{cps=50}We're here not to hide behind city walls. Me and my people are ready to fight for you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 10!
{cps=50}You can't even imagine how glad I am to finally be next to a decisive person.
{cps=50}I am sure that together we will find a way!
{cps=50}Damn it, I married de Montfort solely for the sake of living in wealth as the mistress of a big city, and by the Gods, I'm not going to hand this damn city over to anyone.
{cps=50}Go rest after a long journey and prepare your people. I'm waiting for you tomorrow - it's time to put an end to all this.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [make_rennes_great_again.name!ti].
{cps=50}Unlike your knights, I did not come here for petty fights and palace intrigues. My people and I are ready to fight under your banner.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 3!
{cps=50}Believe it or not, Dupont told me the same thing on the first day after his nomination.
{cps=50}Anyway. I married de Montfort solely for the sake of living in wealth as the mistress of a big city, and by the Gods, I'm not going to hand this damn city over to anyone.
{cps=50}The short fight ends in your favor. A small detachment of mercenaries defending the farm is completely defeated.
{cps=50}{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 3!
{cps=50}{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 2!
{cps=50}The mercenaries are defeated and the farm is under your control. Its inhabitants are not very enthusiastic about this, but they do not show hostility either.
{cps=50}Their reaction is understandable - no matter who gets the farm, they still have to pay a quitrent to someone...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [suicide_squad.name].{vspace=5}Rennes strength increased by 3!
{cps=50}Thanks to your timely appearance, the defeat of the vanguard is avoided and the mercenaries are forced to retreat.
{cps=50}Looking at the retreating detachment, however, you realize with dread that it's only a small group of enemies you have fought off just now. The main forces that are already formed in battle formations are moving right at you.
{cps=50}But Dupont and his knightly cavalry, no matter how much you look around, are nowhere to be found...
{cps=50}Whether they fled or just went into some very deep flanking maneuver - it doesn't matter now. Now the outcome of the battle depends solely on the resilience of the infantry under your leadership...
{cps=50}And just when the hope of victory seems to be lost, Dupont's cavalry, literally out of nowhere, appears behind the backs of the mercenaries. With loud war cries and at full speed, the knights wedge into the stunned mercenaries - like a crushing blow of a hammer they flatten them against the anvil of your shields.
{cps=50}Most of the mercenaries die. Only a small group manages to escape this fate by breaking out of the encirclement and hiding in the forests.
{cps=50}The victory is yours.
{cps=50}When you find Dupont, he and his knights are already celebrating victory, uncorking bottles of wine one after another.
{cps=50}You ignore his invitation to join the celebration and lash out at him with harsh criticism - berating him for being late, which nearly killed you and your people.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Usually arrogant Dupont this time, however, is moved by your words, and instead of just brushing you off - as he usually did before - he sincerely apologizes.
{cps=50}To show his affection towards you, he takes a ring off his finger and hands it to you - offering it as a symbol of friendship, as well as a reward for the courage with which you defended Rennes.
{cps=50}Despite the fact that the delay with which Dupont and his knights arrived on the battlefield almost cost you victory (and your life), you choose not to blame him for what happened and to be thankful.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}Having dealt with mysterious opponents, you pick up a medallion with a pentagram from the body of one of them, thanking its owner for saving you from having to go down into the crypt.
{cps=50}Yes. But it turned out to be not as easy as you described.
{cps=50}But instead of bandits, I have encountered knights there...
{cps=50}Yes. Well, it wasn't scary. And I've managed to do it.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You hand her the medallion.
{cps=50}I can't help but ask ... This thing bears little resemblance to what would suit a good Christian. Why do you need something like this?
{cps=50}You're scaring me.
{cps=50}But you promised to explain everything to me!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}While you are coming up with an answer, Anna winks at you and disappears in the interiors of her laboratory.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You call out to her but it doesn't work. For a second, you think about looking for her, but quickly abandon this idea, considering such behavior too tactless.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As you are about to leave everything as is and go, Anna suddenly appears: a little bewildered, in smoking alchemical gloves and with her hair disheveled.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She hands the medalion to you.
{cps=50}Can I help you?
{cps=50}Well I tried to tell you! They were well armed and clearly had solid combat experience...
{cps=50}I don't know what the Tree of Life is, but they indeed had some kind of tree painted on their shields.
{cps=50}It quickly becomes clear that the numerous rumors about the impending mercenary raid on the city were true.
{cps=50}One morning, another scout arrives in Rennes with the very news that the townspeople have been anticipating with such horror and hoped never to receive.
{cps=50}Onar decided to bring the war to Rennes - mercenary detachments are moving to storm the city walls.
{cps=50}This turn of events does not come as a shock to you, Olivia, or Dupont - over the past few days, thanks to your actions, the mercenaries have consistently failed, losing people, territory, and with it the initiative.
{cps=50}Both Ruffin and Onar are no fools at all. Perfectly understanding that this could not drag on for a long time, they decided to go all-in.
{cps=50}However, there are also some unpleasant surprises. Despite the townspeople's certainty in the absence of siege weapons, which they would be forced to defend their city from, it does not turn out to be true.
{cps=50}When the first enemy units appear from the forests surrounding the city, you immediately notice several, albeit somewhat crooked, but still clearly working siege towers, as well as many long assault ladders.
{cps=50}The impregnability of the city walls, on which your allies relied so heavily, was now clearly in great doubt.
{cps=50}Hoping that the efforts to strengthen the defense of Rennes were not in vain, you go to one of the fortress walls to lead the defense of the most critical segment.
{cps=50}On your way, you encounter Olivia - in full armor and with a sword in hand. When you ask where the hell she is going, the duchess declares that she will defend her city with a weapon in hand.
{cps=50}You try to stop her, but she does not respond to any persuasion. The only thing that you manage to get from her is a promise to not be in the forefront and to stay behind.
{cps=50}Obviously counting on an easy victory over an inferior in strength enemy, the mercenaries act boldly and straightforwardly - throwing everything they have into a frontal attack on the city walls...
{cps=50}Despite the best efforts of the attackers, they fail to break through you.
{cps=50}With tremendous efforts, you manage to stop the attack on your section of the wall.
{cps=50}Anxiously looking around, you notice that things are not going so well: a small detachment of mercenaries, having broken through the defense of the townspeople, has already penetrated the fortress walls and is now trying to open the city gates.
{cps=50}Two knights, led by Dupont, are already moving towards the gate, but they are outnumbered and would clearly need your help.
{cps=50}You rush to the city gates, forgetting about the wounds and tiredness.
{cps=50}A group of mercenaries that broke through is led by a heavily armed knight. You choose him as the main target and attack...
{cps=50}You're eager to help them, but you are too wounded and exhausted by the heavy fight on the wall to engage in another confrontation.
{cps=50}As you retreat to a relatively safe place, you watch as events unfold.
{cps=50}Despite the fury with which the mercenaries launched the attack, the townspeople are somehow able to withstand their initial onslaught.
{cps=50}Seeing that Rennes is defended by a hastily assembled, yet full-fledged force instead of three poorly armed cripples, the mercenaries quickly lose their confidence.
{cps=50}The detachment that has broken into the city still manages to open the gates but they are not able to further their success, because by the time this happens, Ruffin's main forces are already beginning to retreat from the walls. All that is left for the remaining mercenaries is to also join the retreat through the very gate they just opened.
{cps=50}You manage to hold the city.
{cps=50}And they unfold according to the worst possible scenario. The forces, hastily assembled by you, Dupont, and de Guesclin, are clearly unable to fight back the mercenaries. And now with you out of the picture and Dupont distracted by the defense of the gate, the walls quickly pass into the hands of the attackers.
{cps=50}A few minutes later, the defenders begin a panic-induced retreat deep into the city streets.
{cps=50}And it becomes finally clear to you that it is simply not possible to defend Rennes...
{cps=50}The enemy is holding strong. It may be wiser to retreat to save your life...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}Despite all your efforts, you cannot stop the enemy - the mercenaries open the gates, forming a huge hole in the city's defenses.
{cps=50}And it becomes finally clear to you that it is simply not possible to defend Rennes ...
sp undefined
{cps=50}You deal with the guards without any problems.
{cps=50}With the help of your comrades, you deal with the guards without any problems.
{cps=50}Your people urge you to get out as soon as possible so as to not waste precious time. However, before you go, you have an opportunity to look through the prison warehouse...
{cps=50}When you break through the guards and escape out of the prison, it becomes obvious that you can no longer stay in the city.
{cps=50}There are only two escape options - through the main gate or by sea. At first glance, the option with a gate seems much more attractive to you, since it is only a couple of blocks away, while the docks, on the other hand, are located at the other end of the city.
{cps=50}But, as soon as you remember that the rebels are waiting for you outside the city walls, the plan involving the gates immediately ceases to seem suitable.
{cps=50}And when one of your soldiers reports that there are several ships at the city docks, one of which you will be quite capable of 'requisitioning', you decide to break through the whole city.
{cps=50}While you were regrouping your troops and deciding in which direction to move, news of the daring escape of a dangerous criminal and a gang of his henchmen have already spread all over Rennes, turning it into a buzzing hive.
{cps=50}And the bounty assigned to your head added not only the guards but also plenty of urban adventurers to the number of your opponents...
{cps=50}Having ensured Dupont's support, you once again unite your forces and, at the head of all the combat-ready people who could only be gathered in the city, set out on the last campaign.
{cps=50}Moving towards the farm at the head of this not-so-small army, you feel that the hour of reckoning is close.
{cps=50}For a long time, Ruffin and his men escaped justice. To be fair, he should have been put on trial for his crimes a long time ago, back in Cambrai - while still in the royal army...
{cps=50}But what goes around comes back around. Sooner or later.
{cps=50}Thinking about this, you realize that it was Ruffin who, to some extent, became the culprit of your meeting with Olivia. And if you had finished him back in Cambrai, you might never have met the duchess.
{cps=50}What is this if not Fate itself?
{cps=50}A necessary evil, without which a chain of strange events that brought two seemingly made for each other people together, would never have started.
{cps=50}Ruffin's cunning and thirst for blood have given you the opportunity to demonstrate your honor and courage. The darkness he created showed you where the light could be shed.
{cps=50}And, perhaps, the one would not have existed without the other.
{cps=50}Dupont's appearance snaps you out of your thoughts. He tells you that he has recently sent a group of scouts to inspect the mercenary fortifications on the farm, and the results are quite disturbing.
{cps=50}Ruffin's men have turned their camp into a well-fortified position that will not be easy to take. In addition, the rebel-friendly placement of the farm on top of a large hill negates the possibility of using knightly cavalry for a crushing blow, as in the battle at Olivier's farm.
{cps=50}Dismounted and heavily armed knights slowly climbing up the hill would be an excellent target for archers and crossbowmen - such a strategy will definitely lead to defeat.
{cps=50}The only option, according to Dupont, is to attack with light infantry, which will consist of militia as well as experienced warriors like you and your people. As soon as you are able to force the mercenaries out of the first line of defense, the knights will join in. And after that, you will have to rely only on God.
{cps=50}You are not very enthusiastic about this plan, but you cannot disagree with Dupont either - the head of the guard is right. Risking knights in such a situation is a sure way to failure.
{cps=50}As a result, you have no choice but to lead the first wave of attackers...
{cps=50}The mercenaries could not hold their positions and are forced to retreat deeper into the farm...
{cps=50}With great difficulty, you manage to push the mercenaries back from the front line of the defense and gain a foothold in their positions.
{cps=50}Not wanting to waste even a minute, you immediately dispatch an envoy to Dupont to tell him to advance immediately with his heavily equipped infantry and knights.
{cps=50}After a while, you look back and notice numerous reinforcements led by Dupont, moving in your direction.
{cps=50}The head of the guard, however, is extremely slow in his usual style, so it will take at least a quarter of an hour before he reaches you with reinforcements.
{cps=50}At the same time, you notice that recently retreated mercenaries are preparing a counterattack...
{cps=50}The mercenary counterattack fails.
{cps=50}With tremendous effort you manage to hold your position until Dupont's knights approach.
{cps=50}With their arrival, the already faltering forces of the mercenaries begin to fall back and you rush into the farm.
{cps=50}Despite the fact that the battle can already be considered won, you cannot forget about the main target - Ruffin.
{cps=50}When you break through to Onar's mansion with your people, you find it already deserted and completely abandoned.
{cps=50}But just when you already want to give up and come to terms with the fact that you missed your nemeses again, you notice two horsemen hurrying out of the stable and galloping away from the farm.
{cps=50}Realizing that those are the infamous rebel leaders, you, nevertheless, hesitate for a second, not daring to immediately rush in pursuit.
{cps=50}After a tough fight, you are so drained that you can hardly stand on your feet and the last thing you want is to meet face to face with Ruffin, but fail to be a worthy opponent.
{cps=50}However, you feel the need to put an end to this whole story and you set off in pursuit.
{cps=50}At first, seeing the pursuer behind them, the fugitives speed up, trying to break away. But, after about a quarter of an hour, they realize that they don't have enough time or distance to hide. And since there is only one person chasing them, they stop, allowing you to get closer.
{cps=50}One of them remains slightly behind and after getting closer, you recognize Onar. The second one is heading straight for you. And he needs no introduction.
{cps=50}You feel the urge to utter some weighty phrase - to call Ruffin out on his actions or to threaten him with retribution. But before you can think of anything worthy of the situation, the enemy, without saying a word, draws his sword and simply rushes at you.
{cps=50}You decide not to risk it and let Ruffin go.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}This unpleasant decision leaves a bitter aftertaste in your mouth. A decisive victory over the mercenaries could have put an end to the bloody war between the city and the rebels.
{cps=50}And also grant you an opportunity to get even with Ruffin.
{cps=50}However, you are comforted by the realization that life is not a fairy tale in which the villain is always caught and defeated.
{cps=50}Those who tend to try to bite off more than they can chew always run the risk of choking and being left with nothing. Or even giving up the ghost altogether.
{cps=50}Now you are the victorious hero, the defender of the city, and the favorite of the young duchess. A man upon whom fortune, it would seem, finally smiled...
{cps=50}But if you set off in this pursuit, who knows what would have happened... And there is no guarantee that you wouldn't meet tomorrow morning lying somewhere in the roadside mud with a slit throat.
{cps=50}In the end, revenge is a dish best served cold, and something tells you that your paths with Ruffin will definitely cross again...
{cps=50}Another one of your strikes makes Ruffin fall down to the ground.
{cps=50}The mercenary immediately tries to get up, but the wounded body lets him down and all he can do is just to raise himself a little... But he falls again.
{cps=50}Numerous streams of blood spread from his body in different directions, rapidly forming small puddles. There is no doubt that he will never get up again.
{cps=50}Ruffin himself, as if refusing to believe in what is happening, continues to struggle on the ground, but with every second he is getting slower and weaker. Without taking his eyes off you, he tries to say something, but only an incoherent wheeze escapes his bloodied mouth.
{cps=50}You feel that this is a good time to say something. And, since Ruffin's eloquence is now clearly gone, you take it upon yourself.
{cps=50}'If you're used to living hard, Ruffin, then dying should come easy.'
{cps=50}After finishing off Ruffin, you are surprised to notice that Onar, who had enough opportunities to disappear while you fought, has not gone anywhere.
{cps=50}And even more than that - he himself approaches you.
{cps=50}For the first time you meet face to face with the rebel leader and can finally get a good look at him.
{cps=50}He looks about fifty years old, well dressed, with gray hair and a very calm face with a frozen expression of discontent and slight disgust.
{cps=50}You see him for the first time in your life, yet you can swear that he has the same expression at any time and in any situation.
{cps=50}After catching up with you and casting a long look at Ruffin's body, Onar sighs briefly, as one sighs when some nuisance occurs, and looks up at the sky.
{cps=50}Well, this is the end then, I guess, - he says.
{cps=50}Looks like it is, - you answer.
{cps=50}I could tell you ten thousand reasons why everything I did was right and necessary, but I don't think they will interest you... - he says and immediately adds, - Just as they did not interest the late duke.
{cps=50}'I know that not only the truth is on my side, but also the Lord Himself... You too will understand this one day, but it will be too late.'
{cps=50}'Well, let's not waste time - we both understand why you were chasing us...'
{cps=50}Onar doesn't resist when you pierce him with your sword.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 15!
{cps=50}The second dead body falls to the ground a stone's throw from Ruffin's and the story of the rebellion now truly reaches the end.
{cps=50}Yes, killing unarmed Onar was not part of your plans, but someone had to do it. At least so that the children in Rennes would not have to die of hunger again, and their fathers would not have to die defending the city from the thugs.
{cps=50}This is how life works. Even though this part is rarely mentioned in the stories about knights and their valiant feats.
{cps=50}The murder of the unarmed and unresisting Onar is not part of your plans.
{cps=50}You hesitate for a few moments, but then you realize that he is no longer a danger to anyone - neither you nor Renn.
{cps=50}Alone, without friends, without money or an army - he threatens the city no more than any single random mercenary who miraculously survived the final battle and took refuge in the surrounding forests.
{cps=50}You let him go and turn back.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}Every stray dog in the city already knows all the details of the battle by the time you return to Rennes.
{cps=50}The participants in the battle are greeted as heroes and, after your solemn entry into the city, its huge gates, instead of being hastily slammed and shut, remain open for the first time in many months.
{cps=50}You have won again! I can't even count the times I said these words...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 20!
{cps=50}I'm not sure if I can find a reward worthy of all that you have done for me and my city. For whatever it is, it will still be insignificant in comparison with your deeds.
{cps=50}But I'll still try...
{cps=50}However, I have to ask you one very important question first.
{cps=50}I know that the rebel forces are completely defeated, but what happened to their leaders? These scumbags Ruffin and Onar - are they dead?
{cps=50}I killed both with my own hands. You will never hear of them again.
{cps=50}You won't hear about them again.
{cps=50}Well, as I promised you... It's finally time for your reward.
{cps=50}I've never met anyone more worthy than you. When we first met, I thought of you as just a useful puppet who would help me defend the city, but I had this unexplainable feeling, that became stronger with each new minute spent together.
{cps=50}And now I can finally say it.
{cps=50}I love you.
{cps=50}And I want you to marry me.{w}{vspace=5}This city should be yours by right.
{cps=50}As well as I.
{cps=50}These are the sweetest words I've ever heard.
{cps=50}I love you too... And I agree.
{cps=50}In that case, I suggest not to waste any more time...
{cps=50}After marrying Olivia and accepting the title of duke, you begin the new chapter of your life.
{cps=50}From a rootless militia errand boy to a mercenary doing all the dirty work to a noble and titled person... For the first time in your life, you've become the one who issues orders and not the one who carries them out.
{cps=50}With the title and power comes wealth.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+1000 Florins!
{cps=50}They say that money and fame change people and the opportunity to test the truth of these words on your own skin does not take long.
{cps=50}The long confrontation with the rebels completely emptied the city treasury and, although your own pockets were full, the same could not be said about your army comrades.

{cps=50}Soon, common folk - both townspeople and local farmers - applied for compensation. Many of them had their property seriously damaged during the war, and many are left even without a roof over their heads.
{cps=50}They all decided to seek financial help and support from the new duke.
{cps=50}As a truly generous person, you cannot ignore such pleas and, naturally, help them.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!{vspace=5}-250 Florins!
{cps=50}As a typical politician, you promise to take into account the interests of the vulnerable segments of society, when building the economic priorities of the city in the future. But sharing your own money with them is not part of your plans.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Several years pass by. And when it already seems that the number of skirmishes that have fallen to your share has come to an end, you hear rumors about a new war between England and France and another invasion of the English army on the mainland.
{cps=50}This time under the command of a young king, whose enlisters are now actively recruiting mercenaries.
{cps=50}This news immediately rekindles your already quenched thirst for risk and adventure, but is the game worth the candle?
{cps=50}Going to France, you were a rootless poor man with empty pockets. Nothing held you down at home and you had nothing to risk but your own life. But now you have a fair fortune, your own land, and a beautiful wife...
{cps=50}Who, by the way, immediately threw a wild fit as soon as she heard that you were seriously considering going to another war.
{cps=50}Olivia's tears, however, cannot change your mind. Several years of a comfortable, well-fed, and calm life not only did not deter you from adventures but, on the contrary, exacerbated your desire for them.
{cps=50}And therefore, not wanting to waste time, you say goodbye to Olivia and, at the head of a dozen other volunteers, set off towards the English camp.
{cps=50}After weighing all the pros and cons, you decide that you have had enough adventures in your life and now is the time to settle down.
{cps=50}In the end, the biggest mistake a person can make is to continue looking for happiness when in reality he has already found everything he needs.
{cps=50}And this is how the story of your adventures ends.
{cps=50}Despite Olivia's beauty and the all-round appeal of her proposal, being a duke and settling for a married life is not something that allures you.
{cps=50}Having refused, you stay in Rennes only for a few days. And after receiving a reward and catching your breath you leave the city, towards new adventures.
{cps=50}You spend several years in these wanderings, during which you earn the fame of a famous mercenary, and also get to the southern province of Aquitaine.
{cps=50}It is there that you and your small detachment will hear the news of another invasion of France by the English army, this time under the command of a young king, who recently ascended to the throne.
{cps=50}Hearing that royal recruiters are actively enlisting mercenaries on the continent, you do not hesitate to head towards the English camp...
Aquitaine
{cps=50}I've already lost my entire army and now, thanks to those fools, I'm about to lose the city, and after that, most likely, my own head!

{cps=50}The rest of the soldiers are initially shocked by your behavior, but soon you get nods of approval from several of them.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 6!
{cps=50}Just like there is no honour among thieves — there are also no rules in a street fight. And being no stranger to street fights, you know perfectly well that there was only one way this could go. Once your opponent gets distracted, you seize the opportunity and jump him with a quick flurry of heavy blows that knock him unconscious.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Strength|Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}But the guy turns out to be prepared and manages to dodge your attack. A chaotic fight ensues...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength, Agility — fail!
{cps=50}But it does not last long because after a minute you are interrupted by the enraged sergeant, who first orders to break you up, and then slaps you both across the face.
{cps=50}Luckily for both of you, the sergeant decides not to report the incident to command and you manage to avoid a harsh punishment.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check passed!]
{cps=50}However, this story clearly did not add to your reputation in the eyes of your comrades.
{cps=50}Wishing to teach a lesson to all participants of this incident, the sergeant orders to whip you all.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]
{cps=50}And not only the two of you who participated in the fight, but also several other soldiers who just happened to be nearby.
{cps=50}In general, you got off easy, especially since you could get into shackles, or even get executed for such an offence.
{cps=50}Your comrades, however, are not so enthusiastic about even a relatively light punishment and now clearly harbor a serious grudge against you.
{cps=50}Not wanting to stoop to low blows and risk getting seriously punished, you suggest the offender to resolve the issue in an honest fist fight in a secluded place near the fortress wall.
{cps=50}He agrees without hesitation and you go to the fortress wall. But you don't get very far, because as soon as you turn your back to him, you immediately receive a series of powerful blows.
{cps=50}You have no way of defending yourself, and before you have time to figure out what is happening, you are already lying in the mud with a buzzing head and a taste of blood in your mouth.
{cps=50}As you come to your senses, you remember a phrase once dropped by your father - 'Honor is for the knights, noble maidens, and pompous idiots'.
{cps=50}The sergeant gives you the letter and tells you to come to him to get water later when you are ready. The luggage may turn out to be quite bulky, so it would be handy to pick up some kind of bag. However, the sergeant himself can give it to you as well.
{cps=50}Now that you know the strong and weak points of the fortifications, you find a place where, under cover of darkness, you can relatively easily get out of the city.
{cps=50}In addition, the sergeant advises you to take a good look at the surrounding places. And if you come across a place that the foragers have forgotten about and where you can still get hold of some food - be sure to report it to him.
{cps=50}Obviously for a reward.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [mouths_to_feed.name].
{cps=50}And now, having arrived at his residence on orders, you find him in a good mood.
{cps=50}This assignment is not just a whim of mine. This time the initiative comes from you know who. And there should be no failure.
{cps=50}The road to the Southern farm - the closest of the three - turns out to be unguarded and your squad easily approaches it.
{cps=50}Settled into convenient positions for observation, you notice that a small group of mercenaries is actually present on the farm.
{cps=50}They have significantly larger numbers than you, but, apparently, they are not so ready for military operations. There is no full security around the farm, and most of the mercenaries just wander here and there, chatting or hanging around the local tavern.
{cps=50}Perhaps if you get closer, you could overhear pieces of their conversations.
{cps=50}Carefully sneaking up to the tavern, you listen to the numerous echoes of conversations that reach you.
{cps=50}Most of them are about all sorts of nonsense - the salaries, the weather, the recent skirmishes with the townspeople, and the huge ass of the tavern owner's daughter.
{cps=50}However, in addition to useless nonsense, a couple of very interesting phrases reach you.
{cps=50}You learn that your old friend Ruffin is at the head of the whole detachment of mercenaries who threaten Rennes, he came here from Flanders to earn money after the end of the war. Onar's farm became his headquarters, which he plans to turn into a fortified point.
{cps=50}However, only captives are involved in the farm fortification, of whom there are very few. And therefore the work is dragging on.
{cps=50}As for Ruffin's people, there are many of them, mostly renegade soldiers and all kinds of deserters from both English and French armies. The backbone of the squad, however, is made up of veteran mercenaries, many of whom have many years of experience and have gone through several wars. No wonder they defeated the duke's forces with such ease.
{cps=50}You carefully return to your observation position, and from there back to the city.
{cps=50}The farm of Olivier - a wealthy farmer and associate of Onar, who leads the rebellion - is well defended. Taking a quick glance around the houses, you can easily count more than two dozen well-armed mercenaries there.
{cps=50}Most of them are actively practicing with weapons or shooting crossbows, although some rest at tables near the tavern or hang out around several bonfires.
{cps=50}You don't even think about getting closer to try and overhear bits of conversations because you would be in full view, so you have to limit yourself to visual observation.
{cps=50}And it bears fruit - among other, similar looking buildings, you notice a prominent building with a small signboard. It is not possible to read its contents from a long distance, however, some alchemical symbols are clearly drawn on it.
{cps=50}The building itself, upon closer examination, does indeed resemble an alchemical laboratory. And, judging by the smoke coming out of its chimneys, work is in full swing there.
{cps=50}Soon you manage to make another valuable observation: a cart, guarded by several well-armed horsemen and loaded to the brim with something, comes to the farm from one of the neighboring villages.
{cps=50}Upon arrival, the cart is immediately directed to the laboratory, where several commoners and mercenaries start to quickly unload it. The unloading process is supervised by an unusually dressed woman, who came out of the house.
{cps=50}She looks like she is in her late twenties, but despite her young age she seems very domineering, confidently giving orders left and right. And, even stranger, both peasants and mercenaries prefer to obey.
{cps=50}When the unloading is over, the mysterious woman disappears into the building again.
{cps=50}Considering your mission accomplished, you turn back...
{cps=50}After leaving the fortified city, you, with a small detachment of your people, go to the Onar's farm.
{cps=50}Your journey, however, ends much faster than you expected - you already notice several observation mercenary posts long before reaching the farm's borders.
{cps=50}You clearly underestimated your enemy and definitely won't be able to get to this farm unnoticed.
{cps=50}Although, perhaps, the Onar's farm is so seriously guarded solely because rebels chose it as their headquarters.
{cps=50}All you can do is to be content with only this piece of information and to turn back.
{cps=50}However, instead of listing the atrocities of the mercenaries and the horrors of the occupation that you were expecting to hear about, the peasants actually tell you that they have no particular complaints about uninvited guests.
{cps=50}According to them, mercenaries don't disturb people or interfere with their work. Sometimes unpleasant incidents do happen, but Onar keeps the situation under control.
{cps=50}Moreover, with the mercenaries' arrival there are now much fewer bandits and other crooks on the roads.
{cps=50}Of course, this whole army of hungry mouths has to be well fed... But at least there is no need to feed the city knights now, and this, in general, is not the worst exchange. Especially since the farmers were always left out - townspeople never really cared about their issues and the late duke had promised to drive out the bandits for more than a year, but did nothing.
{cps=50}After thanking peasants for the information, you go back.
{cps=50}The Southern farm is considered to be the most vulnerable position of the mercenaries, and therefore, recapturing it is a feasible task even for a small but well-organized squad.
{cps=50}Realizing well that now is not the time for honor, you make an attempt to secretly lead your people to the farm and attack it unexpectedly.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 5!
{cps=50}A lot depends on the commanding skills and the ability to manage the troops. Fortunately, you have no problems with either of those.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Reputation (soldiers) check passed!]
{cps=50}The mercenaries didn't expect your attack, and you manage to take them by surprise!
{cps=50}However, you are not able to control your squad competently, and the attempt to approach the enemy stealthily fails when observers notice you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Reputation (soldiers) check failed!]
{cps=50}Playing dirty is not in your nature. As a noble person, even when faced with dishonest opponents, you prefer a straightforward frontal attack.
{cps=50}Thanks to your tremendous efforts, as well as the careful work of de Guesclin, in a fairly short amount of time the townspeople have managed to assemble a new army - albeit not too large, but very combat-ready, according to de Guesclin himself.
Two thirds of it are militias and soldiers recruited from among the townspeople - their equipment isn't the best quality, but at least no one goes into this battle with sticks and in bast shoes. Well, or almost no one does.
{cps=50}The remaining third is a small knightly cavalry troop with Dupont at the head of it.
{cps=50}According to the plan, the infantry under your command will engage the mercenaries in battle, which will allow the cavalrymen to bypass them. Then they will unleash a powerful blow on the unsuspecting mercenaries from the flanks and rear.
{cps=50}The surrounded enemy will be demoralized and then destroyed.
{cps=50}This scheme seemed pretty good to you, when you and Dupont sat in his office, bent over a map. But now, on the way to the farm, your creeping suspicions that the plan you have come up with may not withstand a clash with reality become clearer the closer you get to your destination.
{cps=50}Problems start quite early - the mercenaries notice a large detachment approaching the farm, and the vanguard of your troops is attacked long before it can reach its intended initial positions.
{cps=50}You find yourself in the center of the squad when the battle begins. In an effort to prevent chaos, you quickly go forward to save your vanguard and prevent the mercenaries from overturning it...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A candle holder made of a human skull...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A very peculiar choice for a piece of furniture.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Many different books and atlases.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Among them you notice anatomy, alchemy, and astrology books.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}But instead of ink, there is a small key inside.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A human skull...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}When you look closer, you can see some weird symbols resembling runes scribbled in different parts of the skull...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Inside it is a list of all kinds of positions in the city and the army with the names of the people holding those offices, as well as their salaries.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Many of the listed names have remarks about their reliability written in red ink.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Dupont is marked as very reliable. De Guesclin's name, on the other hand, is accompanied by the note 'Dangerous, but necessary for the defense'.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Some documents and other papers.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Almost all of the documents are torn to pieces - as if someone was planning to get rid of them.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You notice Olivia's signature here and there. Looks like these are fragments of the dutchess' correspondence with someone.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Onar's name also seems to appear in different parts of the text, but you cannot make out the full context. And it is just as impossible to say for sure that it is he who is mentioned - the parchment is too damaged.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Multiple scraps of parchment with traces of ink on them are lying mixed with the ash. Letters were burned in the fire.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Some of them survived a little better than others. It is almost impossible to understand their contents, but you can swear that on one of them, at the place of the signature, you can still make out the name 'Ruffin'.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The dresser drawer is closed. You can't look inside it without a key.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You open the dresser drawer with the key.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Inside, for the most part, there are various items of clothing and jewelry.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Continuing to dig into them, you reach the bottom - a moral one (as you rummage in other people's belongings), as well as the literal bottom of the box, on which you find a rag bundle with something solid inside.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}It turns out to be a dagger decorated with pentagrams and occult spells.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Maps of the night sky with numerous astrological charts.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Entire paragraphs of text in the sidebars are devoted to the interpretation of the movement of stars and celestial bodies, as well as the basic principles of predicting the future based on their location.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Many maps have additional handwritten notes and drawings with strange symbols on them, looking at which makes your blood run cold.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Olivia suddenly enters the room.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She catches you digging through her stuff.
{cps=50}May I ask what you're doing?
{cps=50}{cps=50}Olivia, I have to confess something to you.
{cps=50}{cps=50}Really? I think so too, given the situation.
{cps=50}When Dupont and I cleared Olivier's farm, we found an alchemist there. The one who supplied the mercenaries with potions.
{cps=50}Dupont mentioned something like that, yes. So what's the matter?
{cps=50}She introduced herself as Anna...
{cps=50}And told me that she is your sister.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Olivia raises her eyebrows in surprise.
{cps=50}I never had a sister, but even if I did, what right does that give you to rummage through my belongings?
{cps=50}I thought more highly of you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) lowered by 30!
{cps=50}I'm afraid that's not all.
{cps=50}Oh really?
{cps=50}She told me about your deep interest in the occult...
{cps=50}And how you pitted the duke and his lords against each other in order to get rid of all those who learned too much about your games.
{cps=50}And now I have found this dagger here...
{cps=50}A dagger? This is the first time I see it, I had no idea that it was in my room.
{cps=50}It does not belong to me, it is the late Duke de Montfort's thing most likely.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Now it's your turn to raise your eyebrows in surprise.
{cps=50}Really? What a coincidence...
{cps=50}Yes, it's a coincidence.
{cps=50}In reality, all that you have is the unfounded accusations of some rebel sympathiser, whom I have never seen in my life.
{cps=50}So, do you believe her?
{cps=50}Please think carefully before giving me an answer. For our fate, apparently, depends on it.
{cps=50}I believe her.
{cps=50}Oh well...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Taking a step forward, Olivia obediently holds out her hands to you.
{cps=50}In that case, arrest me! On accusations of occultism, murder, conspiracy with the rebels, and God knows what else you came up with!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You carefully approach Olivia, intending to remove the sword from her belt...
{cps=50}I don't know who to believe. Her words sounded convincing to me, but now, having heard you, I understand that everything is not so simple.
{cps=50}Accusations of this kind are disgusting to me, and if you have doubts about my sincerity - then please, you can arrest me and bring me to trial.
{cps=50}Be the judge! And let my blood be on your hands!
{cps=50}Forgive me my suspicions.
{cps=50}I acted like a fool twice - at first I believed in someone's lies, and then shamelessly rummaged through your belongings.
{cps=50}At least you know that it was stupid. Hope this day serves as a lesson for you for the rest of your life.
{cps=50}Frankly, I thought more highly of you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]{vspace=5}Relationship (Olivia) lowered by 30!
{cps=50}You have done a lot for me and my city, and considering this, I will let this slide for now.
{cps=50}But, to be honest, in order to fully win my forgiveness, you will have to do way more than just mumble a pathetic 'sorry'.
{cps=50}Now go. I don't think we have anything to talk about now.
{cps=50}Do what you do best - clear the outskirts of those damn rebels.
{cps=50}I hope you are aware of what you are saying.
{cps=50}These are very loud accusations, and it is very possible that one of us will meet tomorrow dawn in shackles.
{cps=50}And so I ask you to think carefully and tell me again - do you yourself believe in what this Anna told you?
{cps=50}You're right, I'm sorry.
{cps=50}Olivia, I have to confess something to you.
{cps=50}Really? I think so too, given the situation.
{cps=50}Ever since I saw you, I... I just lost my mind.
{cps=50}Olivia raises her eyebrows in surprise.
{cps=50}I have never met a woman like you. I would go to hell and back if you order me to...
{cps=50}Is that so? I think I understand where you are going with it.
{cps=50}But what does it have to do with digging through my things?
{cps=50}One of the knights told me that you have an affair with the head of the guard and I... I just could not bring myself to let it go.
{cps=50}I had to make sure it wasn't true. That's why I decided to commit this stupid and disgraceful act...
{cps=50}Please, forgive me.
{cps=50}I will be honest, your act is a faux pas.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}You are the last person I would expect something like this from.
{cps=50}But the things you feel...
{cps=50}I feel the same way about you!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) Improved by 30!
{cps=50}I won't deny it, I dreamed of hearing such a confession from you under somewhat different circumstances, but it turned out as it turned out.
{cps=50}Under other circumstances, I could pretend to be offended, but you have done too much for me and my city.
{cps=50}Therefore, you are forgiven.
{cps=50}But let's not waste any more time! The most picturesque places of Brittany are waiting for us!
{cps=50}I apologize for keeping you waiting. Urgent matters, you know.
{cps=50}We can go if you are ready!
{cps=50}The next few hours you spend riding through the picturesque surroundings of Rennes.
{cps=50}Olivia doesn't talk much about herself, preferring not to dwell on the details of her past and describing it only as a 'viscous swamp of dull everydayness'.
{cps=50}But she turns out to be a good listener, eagerly devouring your stories of war and adventure.
{cps=50}The duchess reacts so excitedly and enthusiastically to every little thing you tell, that little by little you too are drawn into the stories headlong - almost reliving them in all their details.
{cps=50}When you both get tired of horseback riding, Olivia unexpectedly asks you to teach her some fencing, complaining that she doesn't really know how to use the sword she carries with her everywhere.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}To your surprise, the girl turns out to be an incredibly talented student for a person who has never used a sword.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Moving with impressive agility, she effortlessly dodges many of your blows and even manages to put you in a dangerous position every now and then.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Watching her movements, you catch yourself thinking that if it was not a training duel, but a full-fledged one, then Olivia would have, albeit small, but very real chances to defeat you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As you get more and more tired, a training duel between the Dutches and the head of the mercenary squad turns into an ordinary play fight between a young boy and a girl who briefly forgot about the adult troubles and worries on their shoulders.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The day quickly comes to an end, and soon it’s time for you to head back to the city.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}However, the impressions of those few hours spent with Olivia are left with you for a long time as a strange memory.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A day full of laughter, fun, and light-hearted talk, instead of blood, death, and pain.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A day when the war released you for a moment from its tenacious bloody grip. Released to show what your life could have been if things had turned out differently.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 20!
{cps=50}But when you reach for her waist, the girl suddenly grabs a massive candlestick from the table and hits you on the head with a sudden sweep.
{cps=50}Everything happens fast, but not fast enough to overwhelm you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}Easily dodging her daring attack, you strike the girl with a counter blow - straight in the jaw.
{cps=50}From a blow that would have been the envy of Fulton Everly himself, the duchess collapses to the floor unconscious.
{cps=50}You don't want to hit Olivia back and step away to try and persuade her to stop resisting.
{cps=50}However, instead of surrendering she takes advantage of the fact that you have stepped away and rushes away into inner rooms.
{cps=50}You follow her, but even a second and a half delay is enough for Olivia to open a small secret door in the corner of one of the rooms and disappear into the maze of narrow dark passages.
{cps=50}You try to run after her, but you quickly lose track of the girl among the endless forks and turns.
{cps=50}Thus, Rennes, which has already lost its duke, is now left without the duchess.
{cps=50}Everything happens too quickly, so you don't have enough time to dodge an unexpected blow.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check failed!]
{cps=50}Your head is filled with a deafening ringing, and everything immediately goes spinning.
{cps=50}You sink to the floor, completely disoriented, but then you get hit on the head one more time and lose consciousness.
{cps=50}So what? Are you happy now?
{cps=50}What the hell did you think would happen?
{cps=50}Did you really think that I would let you stop me?
{cps=50}Looks can be deceiving, [name]. My skin is soft and my hands are not covered with calluses from weapons. But I have shed no less blood than you.
{cps=50}I'm not proud of it, no. However, it is what it is. And you should have carefully thought about what exactly you were getting yourself into before you crossed me.
{cps=50}But please don't judge yourself harshly. People always underestimate me, and you are not the first to fall victim to short-sightedness.
{cps=50}So... So the accusations are true? All of them?
{cps=50}We could be together, you know? When you came into my life, I felt something. Something real. It seemed to me that I was able to breathe again for the first time in years.
{cps=50}But for some reason you needed to go and ruin everything.
{cps=50}Why? For what?
{cps=50}For the sake of the truth.
{cps=50}Truth!? Please, tell me that you are joking...
{cps=50}For the sake of the justice...
{cps=50}For the sake of truth and justice... Look at yourself! Listen to what you are saying! You're pathetic.
{cps=50}I thought you were different, but you are the same as that fool de Montfort.
{cps=50}My eyes have been opened. And I would open yours too. We would be happy, all you needed to do was not to get in the way. But you couldn't do even that.
{cps=50}You are a monster.
{cps=50}Maybe, but it's better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.
{cps=50}I have spent half my life as a good God-fearing girl, pleading with God to ease the burden that has befallen me and my family.
{cps=50}I prayed every day, not daring to deviate one iota from the words of Holy Scripture. I was an example of true piety... And what did I get in return?
{cps=50}A father who was killed in the war, a mother tortured to death by bandits, and a baby brother who starved to death.
{cps=50}Oh, and I almost forgot about the treacherous sister, who abandoned us and drove off to arrange her own life.
{cps=50}A nice reward for piety, isn't it?
{cps=50}Therefore, there is no need to tell me about justice, truth, and God, for none of this exists. In this world, there is only your own WILL...
{cps=50}The will for a better life, the road to which runs over the dead bodies of the weak and stupid people blinded by their fears.
{cps=50}I was hoping that you would stand beside me and I would finally not have to be alone anymore. But now I see who you really are...
{cps=50}See that you are nothing more than a pathetic blind man, drugged by your own fear and desperately trying to force yourself to believe your own lies.
{cps=50}You are just another step of my journey.{w} Goodbye. And thank you for your service to Rennes.
{cps=50}With these words, Olivia walks away, leaving you alone in a tiny prison cell.
{cps=50}After looking around inside, you are forced to accept the fact that there is no way to get out on your own.
{cps=50}The complete isolation in which you sit over the next 24 hours is interrupted only once - when the tough warder brings you a plate of cold pottage and a quarter of a piece of stale, moldy bread.
{cps=50}You ask him numerous questions as to why you are here and what awaits you, but he responds only with a crooked grin. And only as he is walking away, he curtly answers - tomorrow morning you will be executed.
{cps=50}Realizing that there is nothing you can do now, you wait for the morning to come, secretly hoping for a miracle...
{cps=50}And a miracle happens: at night, soldiers from your detachment break into the prison screaming and crashing. They kick the warder's arse and immediately release you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Reputation (soldiers) check passed!]
{cps=50}The road to freedom, however, is immediately blocked by a group of city guards who have heard the noise and arrived just in time.
{cps=50}However, the miracle does not happen, and the next morning your head is cut off in a cramped courtyard in the back of the city prison.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Reputation (soldiers) check failed!]
{cps=50}And this is how your adventure ends.
{cps=50}Anna's assignment leads you to a large forest east of Rennes. According to the map, the old chapel should be located right in its center.
{cps=50}However, despite the relatively accurate directions, you are able to find it only after wandering through the forest thicket for a long while.
{cps=50}But when you finally get to your destination, you find that the chapel turns out to be not a chapel at all, but rather something like an old family crypt - definitely built more than a hundred or even two hundred years ago.
{cps=50}The once impressive and massive structure has decayed over time. The white stone it was built from has lost its whiteness and now is covered with a thick layer of dirt and moss.
{cps=50}You can still make out old carvings in some places on its walls, as well as fragments of Latin inscriptions and numerous symbols of the Knights Templar, that hint at who might have been buried here.
{cps=50}But when you are about to go inside this uninviting building, two well-armed people suddenly appear from there.
{cps=50}You hide behind one of the bushes and already want to let them get away, but then you notice that one of them hastily hides some shiny trinket on a chain, that looks like a medallion, under his chain mail.
{cps=50}You have no other options and, having got out of your hiding spot, you call out to strangers. They immediately draw their weapons when they see you...
{cps=50}Given the lack of troops in the city, your squad ends up also involved in street patrolling and guarding of some important facilities.
{cps=50}One night, you are awakened by a group of night guard soldiers. They bring you several poor men, trembling with fear, who were caught stealing food from one of the army warehouses. Moreover, the stolen produce was intended to supply the city guards, as well as the militia that is actively taking new recruits for the city defence.
{cps=50}The poor do not hide their guilt when you question them and explain they are forced to steal by the fact that they have nothing to eat and nothing to feed their families with. The city is cut off from the farms and bit by bit eats up the last crumbs from its supplies. What little is brought by sea goes straight to the duchess's residence and the rest of the city has to be content with scarce leftovers.
{cps=50}Begging your forgiveness, the poor, however, don't hide the fact that if you let them go, they may still have to steal food from the same warehouses until the situation in the city changes.
{cps=50}It is with a heavy heart that you decide to hand them over to the city guards. You understand well what awaits the thieves, but you know even better that a hungry soldier is a bad soldier and without a strong and well-fed militia you cannot hold the city.
{cps=50}You try not to think that by this decision you have sentenced not only thieves but their families too to a certain death.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 15!{vspace=5}Rennes' strength increased by 1!
{cps=50}Knowing well what kind of punishment awaits the hapless criminals at the hands of the city guards, you decide to let them go. Even though you realize that the defenders of the city will now have to starve a bit.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!{vspace=5}Rennes' strength lowered by 1!
{cps=50}Wanting to speed up the process of training new recruits, you send several people from your squad to de Guesclin as instructors for newcomers. Experienced soldiers who have fought many battles can easily drill the rookies on the basics of combat skills and make them at least somewhat ready for a fight.
{cps=50}When you make time and attend one of the drills, you are unpleasantly surprised to see that your men are very tough with the townspeople.
{cps=50}None of the militia sparring sessions so far go without new injuries and bruises. And new recruits regularly get smacked and kicked for their sluggishness.
{cps=50}Seeing your bewilderment, one of your comrades explains that the Rennes townspeople are not very gifted physically and are far from being belligerent. And therefore, if you really want to mold them into something similar to a real army - you cannot do without the hard drills.
{cps=50}However, their reasoning does not convince you, and you tell your people to be gentle with the newcomers - otherwise, by the time the battle with the mercenaries comes, you will have to send off a handful of terrified toothless cripples.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}Of course, your people do not approve of your decision. And this also affects the quality of the training of recruits not in the best way.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Rennes' strength lowered by 1!
{cps=50}You decide not to interfere with the situation, leaving your comrades to choose the right strategy for training newcomers.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check passed!]
{cps=50}After some consideration, you decide not to interfere with the process and let your men pick a proper training strategy themselves.
{cps=50}However, this approach to the training of soldiers affects the city's combat capability and not in a good way. Rumors about the cruelty of your people, which are rapidly spreading throughout the city, seriously reduce the number of volunteers who otherwise would be willing to join the militia. This situation considerably undermines de Guesclin's mobilization plans.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]{vspace=5}Rennes' strength lowered by 1!
{cps=50}Taking a good look at the recruits, you also begin to see that they are not just a bunch of crooks, but some effeminate wussies, who can only be made into real men through harsh training.
{cps=50}You praise your people for their diligence and tell them to be even tougher.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}It turns out that you were absolutely right with the strategy you have chosen, and during one of the training sessions a week later, you are no longer able to recognize the new recruits - instead of yesterday's wussies, you see hardened fighters.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check passed!]{vspace=5}Rennes' strength increased by 1!
{cps=50}Despite the duchess' promise that the financial difficulties of Rennes will not affect the payment that you and your people receive, you still begin to feel the shortage of money.
{cps=50}You continue to receive your salary regularly, but the city treasurer confronts the lower ranks of your detachment with the fact that their salaries are now almost halved.
{cps=50}The soldiers, dissatisfied with the current situation, first of all, come to you for a solution.
{cps=50}Having estimated the costs, you come to the conclusion that you have enough money to pay them...
{cps=50}Having estimated the costs, you realize that you are not able to pay them yourself even if you wanted to...
{cps=50}Realizing the unfairness of the situation, you decide to pay them out of your own pocket, and it seriously boosts your reputation.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}-100 Florins!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 25!
{cps=50}You are well aware of the unfairness of the situation and are willing to share your money with your comrades - even though there is not enough for all of them.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}-50 Florins!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 15
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Half of your Florins lost!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 15!
{cps=50}You don't like the situation with the cut of mercenaries' salaries either and you promise your people to look into it. However, you don't really want to share your own money with them.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 20!
XXXXXX
{cps=50}But what was I even talking about?{w} We are right in the middle of a military campaign, and the French now regularly make sorties from the besieged city...
{cps=50}Oh well, couldn't you find anything newer?{w} It seems to me that this sword is older than the two of us... Are you sure that it will not fall apart if I take it out of its scabbard?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 3!
{cps=50}Is that you again? Didn't I let you know that we have nothing to talk about last time?
{cps=50}Oh, no, wait... I heard you were one of those who participated in the attack on the city where the young Prince almost died.
{cps=50}Is he okay? They say that he managed to break out of the encirclement, but was allegedly badly wounded...
{cps=50}He is fine. The earl and his men came to his aid and he got out safe and sound.
{cps=50}Oh, grazie a Dio.
{cps=50}Although, I won't lie, I would not mind treating the prince's wounds, if there were any...
{cps=50}But what am I talking about? Thank you for the news, you can go now.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Before you can say a word, the girl turns around, making it clear that the conversation is over.
{cps=50}He's fine. He and his people were surrounded in the city square...
{cps=50}... But the boys and I arrived just in time to help him.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The girl is slightly shocked by your words.
{cps=50}{cps=50}You? You have managed to rescue the Prince and his knights?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check passed!]
{cps=50}Well, in that case, you definitely deserve respect.
{cps=50}Although, I must admit that I hardly believe your story.
{cps=50}You, how do I put it, look like someone who would rather have been left to guard the gate, while more courageous soldiers broke through to the Prince.
{cps=50}But I will give it to you and pretend to believe your story.
{cps=50}I must admit that from the first impression you didn't seem to deserve much attention...
{cps=50}But I am always willing to own up to my mistakes.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 10!
{cps=50}Even though you are not even close to being a real knight, at least you can always tell a couple of funny stories.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your words make the girl's eyes widen.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}But it becomes obvious in a second that she does not believe you at all.
{cps=50}You? You have managed to rescue the Prince and his knights?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]
{cps=50}Oh, please. Leave your sweet little lies to those naive simpleton girls from the roadside tavern and don't waste my time.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}Thank you for the news. You can go now.
{cps=50}Well, well, well, who do we have here? It's the terror of the French himself.
{cps=50}You don't have to say anything, I have already been told about your achievements. If not for you and the other brave men, the young prince would have been grabbed by the Frenchies.
{cps=50}You are now basically a hero...
{cps=50}I am not going to lie, I was somewhat skeptical about you when we first met, but now I see that I was clearly wrong.
{cps=50}But, fortunately for you, I am always willing to own up to my mistakes.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 15!
{cps=50}And I must admit that I am glad to see you safe and sound.
{cps=50}Just don't take it the wrong way.
{cps=50}What? Were you injured again!?
{cps=50}Please promise me that you will be more careful next time!
{cps=50}You come in and catch Cecilia doing something very strange.
{cps=50}She walks back and forth from one chest to another, muttering something under her breath and clearly not knowing what to do.
{cps=50}I think I'm going insane.
{cps=50}What's the matter?
{cps=50}My things have started to disappear over the past few days.
{cps=50}Things?
{cps=50}Medicine. I have never been a particularly observant person when it comes to these things, and at first I blamed everything on my own forgetfulness or thought it was just an accident.
{cps=50}But the level it has reached is not funny anymore.
{cps=50}When things disappear without a trace on such a large scale, the matter can no longer be attributed to simple forgetfulness.
{cps=50}I'm afraid I have to ask for your help.
{cps=50}Anything you want.
{cps=50}I'm pretty sure someone is just stealing from my stock.
{cps=50}I usually notice the loss in the morning, so whoever this mysterious thief is, he apparently prefers to act at night.
{cps=50}I'll deal with it, you can count on me.
{cps=50}At night, you go to your hiding spot near the part of the infirmary where medicine supplies are stored.
{cps=50}At first, nothing happens, however, around midnight you notice a suspicious figure sneaking around in the shadows.
{cps=50}An unknown person sneaks up to the infirmary and starts fiddling with the lock, stealthily looking around and trying to remain unnoticed.
{cps=50}In an effort to catch him red-handed, you wait until he opens the lock and goes in. You follow him inside and find him stuffing his bag with all kinds of medicine.
{cps=50}When he sees your menacing figure, his eyes are immediately filled with genuine terror.
{cps=50}However when asked as to why he steals, he tells you a story for which you are not ready.
{cps=50}According to the thief, he steals medicines not for himself, but for one of his comrades, who was seriously injured during a recent attempt to break into the city. He fought bravely and was butchered by the French during the fight.
{cps=50}But now, instead of receiving full-fledged medical care, he has to lie on a simple mat and be content with prayers, since all the doctors and their resources go straight to the knights and their soldiers from among the wealthy.
{cps=50}Now the poor man clings to life only thanks to the help of his friends, who bring him medicine from wherever possible.
{cps=50}The thief begs you to let him go so he can help his friend.
{cps=50}Despite his pleas, you stay adamant and, after taking the stolen from him, send the thief away, warning him that if you notice the loss of supplies again, you will find him and beat his arse.
{cps=50}First thing in the morning you tell Cecilia about what happened, though you say nothing about the thief's story and motives.
{cps=50}She thanks you for your help...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 15!
{cps=50}...but then asks why he was doing this?
{cps=50}You tell her the second part of that story, after which she seems to be confused and says that it's the first time she hears that the royal army treats any wounded in this way - even if it’s ordinary soldiers.
{cps=50}According to her, the knights are indeed the top priority for doctors, but that does not mean that everyone else is simply left to die.
{cps=50}She thanks you for your help with this matter, however, the conversation clearly leaves Cecilia in a bad mood. And you begin to feel guilty as well.
{cps=50}{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 5!{vspace=5}Virtue decreased by 10!
{cps=50}You don't want to tell her the unpleasant truth and make up a hastily cobbled-together story that the night visitor stole medicines on the instructions of the French and was actually one of their spies.
{cps=50}Cecilia listens to you with a mocking smile. She clearly does not believe what you say, but does not ask any further questions.
{cps=50}You manage to save face in front of the girl. However, you are not safe from pangs of conscience.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 10!
{cps=50}Moved by his story, you let him go with the stolen goods.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Mumbling words of gratitude, the hapless thief hurries to hide in the darkness of the night, and you belatedly realize that you probably should have offered him your help in saving his friend.
{cps=50}But, at the same time, you know that you can hardly do much for the poor fellow and, perhaps, you should not get involved in this already sad story.
{cps=50}Having hesitated for a moment, you finally decide to offer your help to the soldier, but he has already run into the night, and you have no choice but to set off in pursuit.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check passed!]
{cps=50}You manage to catch up with him after a while. At first, you want to call out to him, but then you take notice of how strange he is behaving.
{cps=50}For some reason the thief goes towards the camp exit, trying to hide in shadows.
{cps=50}Reaching the edge of the English fortifications, the thief quietly gets out of the camp and runs for his life towards the city.
{cps=50}Chasing him is now pointless, and shooting at such a target in pitch darkness is also clearly a hopeless task. All you can do is shrug your shoulders and go home with the knowledge that you have just missed a French spy.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 5!
{cps=50}In the morning, Cecilia once again notices a mess in her supplies and realizes that you have not managed to stop the night thief. Furious, she attacks you with criticism.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Only when she finally cools down a little do you manage to tell her the details of the story.
{cps=50}She seems to be confused at first, but then she suddenly bursts out laughing at how cleverly the mysterious thief has deceived you.
{cps=50}All of her previous signs of anger and irritation are gone. Guessing that the uninvited guest won't dare to visit her again, Cecilia draws a quite logical conclusion that you have still dealt with the problem. Albeit in a somewhat peculiar way.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 20!
{cps=50}For better or for worse, the soldier vanishes into darkness before you have time to decide on anything and you have no choice but to leave the matter as it is.
{cps=50}Hearing about the motives of the thief, the girl instantly changes expression and immediately asks to forgive her for such a response.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 7!
{cps=50}But at the same time, she, however, notes that the whole story is somewhat confusing and it's the first time she hears that the royal army treats any wounded in this way - even if it’s ordinary soldiers.
{cps=50}Saying goodbye to you, she again apologizes and says that you did the right thing in her opinion. But the whole incident clearly left a bad taste in her mouth.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) improved by 7!
{cps=50}You helped me out once again. I can not find such words that would express my gratitude.
{cps=50}Now it is obvious that this whole campaign turned out to be one big failure and, instead of getting easy money and a carefree promenade through France, I ended up in blood up to my elbows and in mud up to my knees...
{cps=50}But I met you.
{cps=50}And it...
{cps=50}It was worth everything.
{cps=50}I remember that when we first met, you told me that a person's actions speak louder than words... I did not think much of it then...
{cps=50}But now I fully understand what you meant.
{cps=50}As a true knight, I am obliged to follow the code of honor...
{cps=50} For the love of God, drop all this knightly nonsense. Do you really think that I believed for a second that you were a knight?
{cps=50}I saw your deception a mile away. But I also saw something else.
{cps=50}Real character and dignity. As well as honor and valor, which a good half of the knights would be envious of.
{cps=50}You are making me blush.
{cps=50}Blush then. Blush as much as you want. Take off your mask and finally be who you really are.
{cps=50}For what you hide under the mask is much more worthy of attention than your feigned image.
{cps=50}Meeting you was a lesson for me. I used to look down from my high horse on those who are lower than me in status.
{cps=50}But you reminded me that there are things more important than descent.
{cps=50}I would like to stay with you. Perhaps we could even spend the rest of our lives together.
{cps=50}But I'm afraid it's just not meant to be. You don't need to be a fortune teller to see that our paths will diverge very soon.
{cps=50}I join the service of Hugh de Châtillon, one of the French king's barons. The English crown doesn't need my services anymore and so I've had no choice but to look for another 'cushy job'.
{cps=50}But enough whining - you will have plenty of opportunity to grieve in my absence.
{cps=50}Now, let me leave you a little something to remember me by.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have received Cecilia's gift!
{cps=50}At the entrance to the de Lambert estate you feel that something is wrong.
{cps=50}Your fears are confirmed when you get closer - the surrounding buildings have been partially burned and looted, and the estate itself has clearly survived an assault attempt. There are a couple of assault ladders near the walls and a dozen or so dead bodies bristling with crossbow bolts.
{cps=50}Realizing that now is not the best time for a visit, you head back.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Eva is nowhere to be found.
{cps=50}You don't need to say anything. I didn’t do this for praise or reward.
{cps=50}I trust my feelings and so I did what my heart told me to.
{cps=50}I made my choice and now I am ready to face my fate.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And with these words, Eva takes a ring off her finger, and holds it out to you.
{cps=50}I came to visit you.
{cps=50}Do not judge me too harshly - I just wanted to spend time with you, if possible.
{cps=50}I noticed that your estate is living quite a busy life even despite the war.
{cps=50}I see.
{cps=50}You mentioned your father when we first met. Something about him helping the French king raise an army.
{cps=50}I'm ready to die. As any soldier is supposed to be.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}As befits a man...
{cps=50}When death comes knocking on your door - don't be in a hurry to answer. This is what my father used to say.
{cps=50}And these are the words I live by.
{cps=50}You sure seem to be talking about death a lot.{w} Especially for someone, who has only seen war in drawings on the pages of manuscripts.
{cps=50}I'm not scared. Here I am with a sword in my hand, besieging a city in the heart of an enemy domain.
{cps=50}While the fearless French knights, that you speak so highly about, are nowhere to be seen...
{cps=50}It seems that, if anything, it is they who are afraid.
{cps=50}And what is it you see?
{cps=50}You don't have to worry about foragers and marauders appearing here anymore - they have swallowed the bait and now everyone in the English camp is sure that the lands here are already completely plundered.
{cps=50}Oh, you are already here. Wonderful!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) increased by 5!
{cps=50}I can see that you came here not to screw around.
{cps=50}Finally! I'm tired of waiting for you. Already started to think you ran away in the confusion...
{cps=50}Just a little late, that's it.
{cps=50}Oh well. At this rate, if you are going to be late a couple more times, then one day there will be nowhere to rush.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) decreased by 5!
{cps=50}Let's get down to business.
{cps=50}What should I know?
{cps=50}There are three large farms in the vicinity of the city - they used to be the main source of food for the townspeople, and now they are occupied by mercenaries who comfortably settled there.
{cps=50}From the reports of my intelligence, if you even can call it that, we found out that their main base is on Onar's farm - the largest and farthest of the three.
{cps=50}This is not surprising: this farm is large, which means there is enough room for people and their equipment. And also it is located on a large hill, which means it will be easier to defend it.
{cps=50}And we don't know how well the two others, Southern farm and Olivier's farm, are protected.
{cps=50}In that case, the first thing we have to do is to thoroughly reconnoiter the situation.
{cps=50}This I will take upon myself. I will scout the area with my people, but I can tell you right now that if it comes to a full-fledged battle, then we will certainly need the help of your knights.
{cps=50}Hmm. I cannot say that I am very fond of this plan, but it's better than just sitting here.
{cps=50}And as for the knights, I would give you each and every one of them if I could, but, as you can see yourself, I have no real power here.
{cps=50}To be honest, it's basically a miracle that none of them has yet come up with the idea of trying to usurp the throne...
{cps=50}Well...
{cps=50}I think you need to start with Dupont - talk to him. Perhaps he can be influenced...
{cps=50}If it goes well, then a significant part of the knights... Or should I say, a significant part of those who survived will probably agree to go with you.
{cps=50}And at the same time I will start organizing the militia. The poor hardly even know how to fight, but bad is always better than nothing.
{cps=50}{cps=50}I look forward to hearing about your progress. Come back when you get any news.
{cps=50}{cps=50}And thank you.
{cps=50}{cps=50}For the first time in the last month, I begin to feel something even remotely close to hope.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 3!

{cps=50}{cps=50}Oh, and by the way, you can just call me Olivia.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [make_rennes_great_again.name].
{cps=50}Judging by the fact that the mercenaries don't attack, they themselves, apparently, are not too interested in further conflict.
{cps=50}What do you mean by that?
{cps=50}If they let their guard down, then we can try to recapture small farms from them with an unexpected blow.
{cps=50}They need to hold three key points at once, which means that their forces are dispersed.
{cps=50}We may well break them up in pieces if we create a numerical advantage and act decisively.
{cps=50}Damn it, we finally have a concrete course of action!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 3!
{cps=50}I will scout the area with my people, but for a full-fledged attack, it would be very beneficial to have the help of your knights.
{cps=50}If it was up to me, I would give you each and every one of them, but, as you can see yourself, I have no real power here.
{cps=50}I look forward to hearing about your progress. Come back when you get any news.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You catch Olivia going through some papers. Seeing you, she immediately blushes and, hastily and haphazardly shoving papers into a drawer, comes out to meet you.
{cps=50}Awful glad to see you ... As always, actually.
{cps=50}You have done so much for Rennes and for me personally that I can hardly ask for more...
{cps=50}However, I am forced to.
{cps=50}With you being here, the course of the conflict was completely reversed, however, it would be too early to say that the danger has completely passed.
{cps=50}Ruffin and Onar are still in the game, and they are still strong enough to be a threat to the city.
{cps=50}They must be dealt with - once and for all.
{cps=50}I am not asking you to move out immediately - the last thing I want is for you to share the fate of the Duke de Montfort...
{cps=50}But time is very precious, don't lose it. For as long as Ruffin and Onar are alive, my life and the fate of the city will be in danger.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [make_rennes_great_again.name].
{cps=50}You did it again!
{cps=50}I still cannot believe it, but it looks like I’m finally safe.
{cps=50}After so many weeks of excruciating anxiety, so many months of sleepless nights... the threat has finally receded from the walls of Rennes.
{cps=50}And all this is purely thanks to you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 20!
{cps=50}Thank you for such high praise, but I am not the only one who helped save the city.
{cps=50}Dupont and de Guesclin contributed no less than me. And so did many knights and ordinary soldiers, who gave their lives to the cause.
{cps=50}To appropriate the result of our joint efforts would be an unforgivable rudeness.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}To hell with your needless modesty! It doesn't suit you.
{cps=50}You are the hero of the day. Even better, you are the hero of this whole war and the savior of the city.
{cps=50}And my savior too...
{cps=50}So stop blushing like a girl and accept the praise you deserve as befits a man.
{cps=50}I don't make empty promises or just throw words around.
{cps=50}I swore to you to protect the city and I fulfilled my promise.
{cps=50}You are just amazing!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 5!
{cps=50}After the beating you gave them, Ruffin and Onar will probably not dare to stick their noses out of their farm any time soon.
{cps=50}I am not a military strategist and I will not impose advice on you, but I am extremely sure that we simply cannot miss such a moment.
{cps=50}These bastards need to be finished off - as soon as possible and by all means.
{cps=50}I will instruct Dupont to begin preparations for the attack. And you will have to make sure that the mercenaries are kicked from the Southern and Olivier's farms and do not even dare to return there.
{cps=50}And one more thing... Don't take it as indelicacy, but I wanted to ask you...
{cps=50}Maybe we could go out sometime... somewhere...
{cps=50}I mean, together.
{cps=50}Rennes is full of picturesque places - now that the threat of mercenaries has disappeared, we can get out of the city without much fear.
{cps=50}You could teach me how to fight, for example. Because I'm wearing this armor and carrying this sword around like a complete fool, but all my combat experience is limited to childish slapping fights with my annoying sister.
{cps=50}What do you think?
{cps=50}It will be a great honor.
{cps=50}No-no-no. Wrong answer. Let's try again.
{cps=50}I'd love to spend time with you... Olivia.
{cps=50}That's better.
{cps=50}Deal with your urgent matters and come back to me when you are ready.
{cps=50}But please don't make the lady wait.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [wine_and_dine.name]!
{cps=50}I also ask you to forgive me for my indelicacy, but I'm afraid now is not the time for entertainment.
{cps=50}The rebels suffered a heavy defeat, but the war with them is far from over. And the groves and forests around the city are still teeming with bandits and rogues.
{cps=50}I think it would be more appropriate to postpone walks and promenades a little, until the moment when the threat has completely disappeared.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Olivia is clearly very disappointed with your answer.
{cps=50}Hmm... If you were at least half as good at understanding relationships as you are in military affairs, you would be priceless...
{cps=50}But, perhaps, you are right, and I myself have a lot to learn from you.
{cps=50}When the duke and the knights set off to deal with the rebels, I, too, was confident of an imminent and inevitable victory.
{cps=50}It seemed to me that it would be possible to get rid of all the problems at once. But, as you can see, I was grossly mistaken. And now I almost went down the same road again.
{cps=50}Thank you for bringing me down to earth.
{cps=50}I will not hold you back any longer - you still have a lot to do.
{cps=50}I've already heard the news! Olivier's farm is ours!
{cps=50}Another victory - thanks to you again.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 20!
{cps=50}I think you deserve a reward. The treasury, as you know, is empty, so it will be somewhat humble.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+150 Florins!
{cps=50}But your achievements will not be forgotten, and when things will get better, you will be golden. I promise.
{cps=50}I was waiting for you. What's the news?
{cps=50}We have investigated the situation in the outskirts - the Southern farm is rather poorly protected. The mercenaries do not expect an attack at all. I think we can take them on the spot.
{cps=50}Oh my God. If you carry on like that, you can take me on the spot...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 10!
{cps=50}I'm sorry, what!?
{cps=50}I'm just kidding!
{cps=50}I'm just in a good mood - things got off the ground for once.
{cps=50}And not just got off - we are seizing the initiative!
{cps=50}Well, of course, I would not get so excited...
{cps=50}Oh please, don't ruin the moment! You are too handsome for all this hesitant mumbling, I enjoy seeing you confident way more.
{cps=50}Just tell me that everything is under control and I have nothing to worry about.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You don't want to lie, but you cave in.
{cps=50}Everything is under control, duchess...
{cps=50}Olivia. We have already talked about this.
{cps=50}Everything is under control, Olivia. You don't have to worry.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!
{cps=50}Well, that is great.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 5!
{cps=50}I cannot lie to you even if you ask for it.
{cps=50}I am sure that there are enough liars around who are ready to sweet talk for hours on the first request.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}The situation is nowhere near under control, and the city is in real danger.
{cps=50}But I do everything that I can here...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Olivia is clearly unhappy with this response.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And for a second you see a glimpse of annoyance of a spoiled person who is not used to anyone saying 'no' to her face.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}But she quickly pulls herself together.
{cps=50}Um... I hope I will be able to get the support of Dupont and his people first.
{cps=50}And you, I remember, promised to prepare the militia.
{cps=50}About the militia...
{cps=50}The thing is that I have some, let's say, difficulties.
{cps=50}The city treasury is almost empty. I am still able to find some scraps here and there just to pay salaries to you and your people, but I don't have even close to enough money to gather and equip an army.
{cps=50}I am afraid that until we begin to have at least some military successes, it will not be possible to move forward in this direction.
{cps=50}Hmm. So in order to defeat the mercenaries, we need an army, but we will be able to gather it only after defeating the mercenaries. Well, that's great.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Olivia throws up her hands with a guilty smile.
{cps=50}I'm sure you will figure out something.
{cps=50}By the way, I also did not sit around doing nothing while you were gone and appointed a new head armourer.
{cps=50}His name is de Guesclin - you can find him in the west wing. Visit him if you have the opportunity, surely he too can use some help.
{cps=50}Him too? Well, who would have thought?
{cps=50}I wonder if there is maybe someone in this city who would be willing to help ME...
{cps=50}Oh, don't be such a crybaby, it doesn't suit you. As for help, I have an idea how to assist you. But I'll tell you all about it a bit later.
{cps=50}But until then let me say that I believe in you! And I will await the news.
{cps=50}The Southern farm is under our control. The mercenaries who occupied it are defeated.
{cps=50}Lord, really!?
{cps=50}After so many weeks of staying behind the fortress walls and what felt like an eternity of failures...
{cps=50}Damn it, I wasn't so happy even when de Montfort proposed to me.
{cps=50}You are my savior!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 15!
{cps=50}I couldn't have done this without my people...
{cps=50}Nonsense. It is your people who could not have done this without you.
{cps=50}We couldn't have done this without you.
{cps=50}Well, I will not distract you from your victorious advance. One farm is freed and two more to go.
{cps=50}And I'm begging you not to be overzealous in battle. I need you alive.
{cps=50}Ah! I almost forgot! Your reward. 'Tis not much, but this is all that the city can spare considering our difficult circumstances.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+100 Florins!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You arrive at Olivia's chambers in a hurry to respond to her invitation, only to find them empty.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After standing around for a few minutes, you realize that the wait might take long.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As a well-mannered man, you ignore the opportunity to stick your nose where no one invited you.{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}At least not yet invited.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Olivia comes in after about a quarter of an hour...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Despite being an intruder, you decide to allow yourself to look around the duchess's chambers.{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 15!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You and Olivia have nothing to talk about at the moment...
{cps=50}Now that Olivier's farm is finally in your hands, it's time to deal with the alchemical laboratory, and Dupont entrusts you with this issue.
{cps=50}Assuming that its mysterious mistress must have escaped already, you are pretty surprised when you find her inside the laboratory.
{cps=50}My name is [name]. I'm helping Olivia... I mean, I am in the service of the Duchess de Montfort...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You can feel your face turning red.
{cps=50}Umm... You misunderstood me. This is not what you think.
{cps=50}I'll be the one asking questions. Who are you?
{cps=50}Why are you helping Ruffin's people?
{cps=50}I must say that you do not inspire much confidence in me.
{cps=50}I guess she does.
{cps=50}What skulls are you talking about?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Anna throws up her hands.
{cps=50}It's hard to believe for some reason.
{cps=50}You are confusing me. Don't even hope that I will fall for your tricks.
{cps=50}I'm not offended, m'lady. And I hope you too are not.
{cps=50}I would not say that I particularly trust her.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}When you come to Anna's laboratory, you are surprised to learn from one of her many employees that the mistress... has left.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Just a few hours ago.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She left one of the apprentices to run her place as she said she won't be back anytime soon.
{cps=50}But we saw each other quite recently...
{cps=50}You speak in riddles again. The more time I spend in this crazy city and its outskirts, the less I understand the reality of what is happening here.
{cps=50}You are leaving?
{cps=50}But isn't that good? The rebels will be defeated, and peace and tranquility will be restored...
{cps=50}Why do you act as if something bad is happening?
{cps=50}What are you talking about?
{cps=50}I still don't get it...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your confusion clearly amuses Anna, and she continues to walk in circles, enjoying herself.
{cps=50}Traits? How can you even know anything about her character, living so far in the boonies?
{cps=50}Younger sister!?
{cps=50}Why should I trust you?
{cps=50}What in the world?! First you dumbfounded me with this crazy story, and now you are withdrawing yourself?
{cps=50}You confused me a lot during our previous conversation. I was hoping to learn a little more about you.
{cps=50}That's not what I meant at all!
{cps=50}A very important task?
{cps=50}You mentioned that you provided alchemy services to Ruffin's mercenaries and that now you need new clients.
{cps=50}That is true.
{cps=50}Big players?
{cps=50}I'll think about what can be done.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [lobbyist.name]!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recipe learnt!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Anna) improved by 5!
{cps=50}Don't you have any moral issues? Since you're basically supplying both sides of the conflict.
{cps=50}Ha! Who's that I see?!
{cps=50}God strike me now if it is not our new sergeant himself!
{cps=50}You grow fast, lad! Can't keep up with you. Just yesterday you were a bare-assed militia and I barely had time to wipe your snot up... And look at you now - that's a big man right there!
{cps=50}I'm very happy for you, son. But try not to let it get to your head too much...
{cps=50}Even though you and I have the same rank now, you better get it through your thick skull - if the earl's squad is a pond, then I am the biggest and fattest fish in it.
{cps=50}If it’s a swamp, then I’m a huge mean toad sitting on a hefty water lily surrounded by tiiiny frogs.
{cps=50}I croak - you croak too! I want to catch a mosquito - you've already grabbed two. I'm going to dive into the water - you've been waiting for me at the bottom for half an hour.
{cps=50}Remember this one simple rule and you will never have any problems: I am the boss here and you are just a little bitc.. I mean, an errand boy.
{cps=50}Deal?
{cps=50}That's great. And I will make sure that you are treated with the respect you deserve.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!
{cps=50}Well? Have you found anything worthwhile? We have a lot of mouths to feed here, you know.
{cps=50}There is one place to the west of the city - de Lambert estate.
{cps=50}A lot of people took refuge there since the beginning of the siege. This includes many peasants with all their supplies. I’m sure it’s worth a look.
{cps=50}West of the city, you say? Hmm... It's weird that we missed it. Seems like it wasn't on the damn maps. Yeah, that's a fine war preparation for you right here!
{cps=50}Same old crap.
{cps=50}But anyway, you did a great job, lad. As long as there are savvy guys like you, we will not starve even in the Arabian desert.
{cps=50}I'll put in a good word for you with the earl. You deserve your reward.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) improved by 15! Reputation (soldiers) improved by 15!{vspace=5}+75 Florins!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 40!
{cps=50}I'm afraid I have bad news for you. I have traveled all the lands within a radius of several miles west of Cambrai...
{cps=50}And.. How is it going? Is there anything left?
{cps=50}There is nothing left to take. Locals can barely make their ends meet, and those who had at least something before, now are robbed of everything.
{cps=50}Bloody hell! It's the same old crap again.
{cps=50}I wonder if I'll ever go to a war where I don't have to starve?
{cps=50}That's a piss-poor job you did here, [name], to be honest. For some reason, I was sure that you would definitely find something.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}You can go now. Keep looking though. Maybe something will come up.
{cps=50}Not yet, but I'm working on it.
{cps=50}After making your way past half a dozen bodyguards, you finally reach the head of the guard's private quarters. There you find Dupont performing an extremely important task - trying on ceremonial outfits.
{cps=50}The contrast between Dupont and Olivia is drastic - he is wearing a very fancy robe made of silk and fur, as well as several massive gold chains, while Olivia, who has her hair cut very short, now practically lives in her armor.
{cps=50}Aside from that, you notice Dupont's small dagger, inferior in length even to a table knife - as opposed to a long combat sword that hangs on the duchess's belt.
{cps=50}Visibly irritated by your intrusion, Dupont reluctantly listens to you, and even before he says anything, you already know where everything is going.
{cps=50}He says that the mercenary threat is greatly overblown. And these crooks will surely scatter in the coming weeks. Therefore, from a strategic point of view, it would be more beneficial to gain a foothold in the city - which is exactly what he is doing now.
{cps=50}When you reasonably notice that since the mercenaries do not pose any serious threat, why not simply throw them out of the farms they've taken over? - Dupont asks if you even understand anything about warfare?
{cps=50}And, before you can open your mouth to answer, he deliberately begins to slowly explain that the threat posed by the mercenaries is clearly overestimated because you are separated from them by a deep ditch and thick walls. But if, suddenly, these two factors disappear from the equation, then the advantage will definitely be on the enemy side.
{cps=50}Dupont also tells you that while you were relaxing during your sea cruise, he and his men conducted several battle reconnaissance missions and found out that the mercenaries, who were tough to begin with, now got ahold of some kind of potion that makes them incredibly ferocious in battle and basically immune to pain.
{cps=50}These clashes, naturally, ended not in favor of the townspeople, and now most of his knights refuse to oppose the mercenaries again. At least as long as such an advantage is on their side.
{cps=50}Therefore, if you really want to get help, you will have to somehow figure it out first.
{cps=50}This is where your conversation ends, as Dupont makes it clear that if you don't leave him alone right now, he will order his boys to throw you out the window.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [suicide_squad.name].
{cps=50}You inform Dupont that you have cleared the outskirts of Rennes of all small mercenary squads, according to his conditions.
{cps=50}Hearing this, the head of the guard once again expresses admiration for your actions and invites you to carry the banner of the city during the upcoming attack.
{cps=50}But despite the two big victories you had over the mercenaries, Dupont remains collected and cautious on the verge of sluggishness.
{cps=50}At first, when you bring up the need for an immediate attack on Onar's farm, Dupont tries to dissuade you, urging you to wait a little and arguing that the mercenaries are defeated and no longer pose a critical threat.
{cps=50}Now that the city supplies have been substantially restored, and the new defense forces have been assembled and hardened in battle, you don't need to rush.
{cps=50}He says that it will be way more safe to allow mercenaries to act first and then catch them making a mistake.
{cps=50}And they will inevitably make one since they no longer have the advantage, and any sortie from the farm's fortified camp will jeopardize them.
{cps=50}While recognizing certain logic in his words, you, however, are already bound by the promise given to the duchess to deal with the rebels immediately...
{cps=50}... and all that is left for you is to stubbornly insist that the townspeople need to set out as soon as possible.
{cps=50}Dupont reluctantly agrees. However, he draws your attention to the fact that, before attacking Onar's farm, it would be really beneficial to finally clear the outskirts of the city of the small squads of mercenaries that are still roaming the area.
{cps=50}That way you can make sure Ruffin will not get any reinforcements and also protect own flanks and rear during the attack.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [winnig_the_war.name]!
{cps=50}Dupont listens to the information you have obtained from your scouting mission with great interest. He is particularly drawn to details concerning the alchemical laboratory at Olivier's farm.
However, when you suggest that you try to attack the positions of the mercenaries together, he refuses, stating that, firstly, he does not have enough strength for this, and, secondly, he doesn't even know whether he will be able to count on you and your men in battle.
{cps=50}Stung by his words, you remind the head of the guard that it was his comrades who were shattered by the mercenaries in the recent battle, and your people, on the contrary, have only shown their best side.
{cps=50}Dupont, however, is not affected by your comment at all. He tells you that you will have to prove that your proposition for a joint attack is not empty bragging by winning some significant battle with the mercenaries...
{cps=50}For example, at the Southern farm, which, according to you, is so poorly protected.
In addition, Dupont also expects all possible assistance in mustering a new army, and only when Rennes will have a sufficient number of soldiers, you can talk about going on the offensive again.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [suicide_squad.name].{vspace=5}Quest added - [counter_strike.name].
{cps=50}As you bring the news of your success on the Southern farm to Dupont, he nods approvingly, stating that he has never even for a moment doubted you and your people.
{cps=50}Now all you have to do is help him and de Guesclin to draft troops, and after that, a march on Olivier's farm will become possible.
{cps=50}Having fulfilled all the stated conditions, you demand Dupont to fulfill his part of the agreement too.
{cps=50}The head of the guard hesitates for some time, trying to quickly come up with new reasons to delay or even cancel the attack altogether, however, he caves in under your pressure and agrees.
{cps=50}And this means that the army of Rennes, pieced together from scraps, once again raises the banners and marches out.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [counter_strike.name]!
{cps=50}With Anna's request in mind, you carefully try to talk to Dupont about arranging for the purchase of goods necessary for the guards from her alchemical laboratory.
{cps=50}Dupont is interested in your proposition...
{cps=50}However, he catches on your sweet talk and asks if the owner of the laboratory herself sent you, clearly suspecting that something fishy is going on here.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check failed!]
{cps=50}The cunning head of the guard realizes that you are in on it too and is now telling you that he actually doesn't mind helping to resolve your issue, but only if his interests are also taken into account.
{cps=50}The price of the issue, according to him, is 150 Florins.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [lobbyist.name].
{cps=50}And he agrees to try doing business with Anna.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check passed!]
{cps=50}But only if his interests are also taken into account.
{cps=50}The price of the issue, according to him, is 50 Florins.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [lobbyist.name].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You don't have enough money to bribe Dupont.
{cps=50}As soon as the money magically goes from your pocket to the pockets of the head of the guard, he immediately declares that the issue has been resolved and a group of quartermasters will visit Anna very soon. {vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}-150 Florins!{vspace=5}Quest updated - [lobbyist.name].
{cps=50}As soon as the money magically goes from your pocket to the pockets of the head of the guard, he immediately declares that the issue has been resolved and a group of quartermasters will visit Anna very soon. {vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}-50 Florins!{vspace=5}Quest updated - [lobbyist.name].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You and Dupont have nothing to talk about at the moment...
{cps=50}At first, de Guesclin isn't too happy about your visit, sarcastically wondering what the favorite of the duchess is doing so far from her bedroom.
{cps=50}However, de Guesclin immediately changes his attitude towards you after listening to what you had to say and receiving your offer to help.
{cps=50}Surprised once again, but this time by the fact that he met a decent person, de Guesclin immediately gets down to business.
{cps=50}According to him, the two main problems that hinder the gathering of a new army are the lack of money and the people's reluctance to take up arms.
{cps=50}Rennes has always been a trading city and the locals are not known for their belligerence. Not even in more heroic times, let alone today.
{cps=50}Knights and mercenaries traditionally had to fight for the interests of the townspeople. But the ranks of the former have seriously thinned after recent events... And you and your squad are playing the role of the latter this time. There was not enough time to recruit more.
{cps=50}But it is not all that bad. De Guesclin is taking on the personnel problem - he will find new recruits and a way to pay them. He will also teach them the basics of combat. But the question of equipment remains.
{cps=50}The few crumbs that still remain in the city treasury will be used for your and new soldiers' salaries. But there is simply not enough money to buy any equipment.
{cps=50}Here, according to the plan, you come into play. Bring any decent equipment that you can get during your out-of-town missions or that you can buy from local traders.
{cps=50}All this will be used to equip the recruits and then, perhaps, you will be able to form something that resembles an army capable of protecting the walls of its hometown.
{cps=50}{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Added a new quest - [all_the_queensmen.name].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You and de Guesclin have nothing to talk about at the moment...
{cps=50}De Guesclin thanks you for your help.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Rennes' strength has increased!{vspace=5}[all_the_queensmen.completed]/10
{cps=50}He says the equipment that you’ve got should be enough to assemble something relatively similar to a combat-ready squad.
{cps=50}He thanks you for your help.
{cps=50}You get out of the camp and go to the surrounding forests to replenish your supplies, heading towards the unknown adventures lying ahead.
{cps=50}The main purpose of the journey is to get all sorts of useful herbs and plants that can serve as ingredients for alchemical potions, but you are also not averse to hunt if the opportunity arises.
{cps=50}After a while, your search leads you to a thicket of the forest, where you notice a deer.
{cps=50}You immediately reach for the crossbow, not wanting to miss such prey. The deer also seems to be on high alert and cautiously looks around, but it still does not run away - thus giving you a chance.
{cps=50}You kill the deer with one clean shot.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Crossbow skill check passed!
{cps=50}You skin the deer and get some meat that can be sold. Your hunting prey will be a good addition to the previously harvested herbs.
{cps=50}You shoot and miss.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[Crossbow skill check failed!]
{cps=50}The frightened deer immediately rushes away, leaving you with nothing.
{cps=50}So you will have to be content with the herbs you found.
{cps=50}Despite the excellent opportunity to get hold of good prey, you decide not to shoot such a majestic beast and let it go.
{cps=50}You immediately reach for your crossbow, however, when you pick it up, you realize that it is not loaded.
{cps=50}While you are fiddling with a tight bowstring and trying to load a bolt, the deer safely disappears into the wilderness.
{cps=50}During your walk through the forest you come across a group of hunters from the local community.
{cps=50}They turn out to be very friendly and even offer some valuable crossbow shooting tips as you hunt together.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check passed!]{vspace=5}Crossbow skill increased by 1!
{cps=50}They turn out to be not very friendly and end up asking you to leave their hunting grounds.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]
{cps=50}You have wandered through the unfamiliar wilderness, and though you manage to get back to the forest path, you waste a lot of time.
{cps=50}The only good thing that came out of your journey is that you have managed to collect some medicine herbs along the way.
{cps=50}Having wandered through the thicket of the forest for some time now, you suddenly wander out into a wide clearing.
{cps=50}It tells a story of a battle that was fought here many years ago.{w} The grass under your feet is covered in fragments of weapons and armor, but, unfortunately, they are mostly useless.
{cps=50}Looking around more closely, you discover the remains of a noble knight, whose equipment is much better preserved.
{cps=50}Following one of the narrow paths through the forest, you wander into a strange-looking pagan sanctuary with a massive stone altar, decorated with rough carvings - half-erased images of old, forgotten gods of a long bygone era.
{cps=50}The place gives off a strange vibe. Carefully listening to your feelings, you are trying to figure out what it is exactly - anxiety or peace.{w} But you are not able to put your finger on it.
Below, at the altar pedestal, you notice a handful of coins - clearly left there by someone as a gift to the Old Gods.
{cps=50}Perhaps you should also leave a coin or two, but is it even worth it to mess with such forces...
{cps=50}You fish 5 florins out of your pockets and leave them at the base of the altar.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}-5 Florins!{vspace=5}Virtue decreased by 15!
{cps=50}And as you bend down to place them, you catch a glimpse of something shiny lying in the tall grass beside the altar.
{cps=50}That shiny thing turns out to be a strange looking medallion.
{cps=50}You decide to leave some coins at the altar too, so you empty your pockets of all the loose change that accumulated in them.
{cps=50}You put your coins on the pedestal...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}-[player_gold] Florins!{vspace=5}Virtue decreased by 15!
{cps=50}... but nothing happens.{w} Just as you expected.
{cps=50}So all you can do now is go back to harvesting herbs.
{cps=50}You also want to leave some coins at the altar, but your pockets are empty...
{cps=50}You prefer not to mess with those kinds of forces and turn the other way, getting back to collecting herbs.
{cps=50}Your journey takes you to a forest located near one of the villages.
{cps=50}There you meet a local herbalist.
{cps=50}At first, the woman is very cautious, but then becomes much friendlier once she realizes that you are a decent person.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check passed!]
{cps=50}She helps you pick up a bunch of medicine herbs and even shares a couple of recipes with you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Crafting increased!
{cps=50}You already know them, but choose not to tell anything to be polite.
{cps=50}Apparently, you don't look very friendly or trustworthy because the woman hurries to retreat the moment she sees you, leaving you to collect herbs alone.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check failed!]
{cps=50}The Holy Father gives you his blessing and warns you against unnecessary violence and shedding the blood of innocent people.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Most of the roads here have turned into an ugly muddy mess after a recent heavy rain, and now it's difficult to ride even on large carts drawn by two horses.
{cps=50}Therefore, you are not at all surprised when you notice a little single horse-drawn wagon completely stuck in the mud.
{cps=50}Seeing you, the owner of the cart immediately rushes towards you, begging you to help him and try to push the cart out of the mud together.
{cps=50}You wouldn't leave a person in trouble, even a complete stranger.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 3!
{cps=50}You roll up your sleeves and begin to push the cart, trying to get it out of the mud.
{cps=50}Thanks to your impressive physical strength, after some time you manage to push the cart out.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Strength check passed!]
{cps=50}Overwhelmed with joy, the owner, who turned out to be a local brewer, can not stop thanking you. As a reward he offers you a couple of bottles of his ale, expressing the hope that this will serve as a worthy compensation for your help and time.
{cps=50}Despite all your efforts, you clearly do not have enough strength, and having spent several hours trying to push the cart, you still cannot move it an inch.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Strength check failed!]
{cps=50}After thanking you for your help, the unlucky owner of the cart unharnesses his horse and goes to the village for help. You continue on your way, returning to collecting herbs.
{cps=50}You, however, have other plans and are not going to waste time on someone else's requests. Especially with this kind of vague probability of profit.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!
{cps=50}Refusing a stranger, you get back to harvesting herbs.
{cps=50}While collecting herbs, you suddenly notice a venomous snake lying on a large stone.
{cps=50}Even your modest knowledge of wildlife is enough to know about its extremely dangerous and potent venom that could come in handy during your alchemical practices.
{cps=50}But is it worth the risk?
{cps=50}You are willing to take a risk to get even a little bit of that valuable venom. You gently sneak up closer to the snake...
{cps=50}Thanks to your dexterity, your plan works. You creep up on the snake and kill it with one blow.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}Now, in addition to useful herbs, a small amount of valuable snake venom also becomes your booty.
{cps=50}However, you don't have enough agility for such a maneuver.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check failed!]
{cps=50}Before you can hit it, the snake quickly strikes and immediately disappears in the grass, leaving you with a nasty bite.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Toxic!
{cps=50}After some thought, you decide that the game is not worth the candle and leave the snake alone, going back to your business.
{cps=50}But, unfortunately or maybe fortunately, the opportunity doesn't present itself.
{cps=50}During those few hours of search, nothing worthy of attention happens to you.
{cps=50}On the way back, you unexpectedly stumble upon someone's poorly hidden cache of gold.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}+40 Florins!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}+55 Florins!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}+65 Florins!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}+75 Florins!
{cps=50}Wandering through the forest, you are gradually overcome by an increasingly growing sense of danger.
{cps=50}And your gut feeling turns out to be true when you unexpectedly stumble upon a giant boar, leaving just a few steps between you two.
{cps=50}The enraged beast immediately rushes at you, forcing you to flee.
But, thank God, you have enough endurance and your quick legs safely carry you away from the wild monster.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Endurance check passed!]
{cps=50}With tremendous effort, you manage to escape from the beast, but the chase leaves you completely exhausted, and you will obviously need a lot of time to rest once you return.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Endurance check failed!]{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}On your way home you hear wolf howls somewhere nearby. You speed up in hopes of avoiding the danger...
{cps=50}However, this does not help as ten minutes later a small pack of aggressive wolves appears near you and their intentions are clear.
{cps=50}Running away is not an option so you are forced to face them.
Deftly dodging attacks, you wound several wolves, which quickly cools off their eagerness, forcing them to retreat.
{cps=50}The victory is yours, and you return to the camp. Albeit rumpled and very tired, but still alive.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}You manage to dodge only a few of the wolves' attacks.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check failed!]
{cps=50}But then the pack's advantage in numbers becomes apparent as they start to bite and claw you from all sides.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Bleeding!
{cps=50}You keep fighting and even manage to wound them yourself several times. Because of that wolves finally decide you are not worth the risk and retreat into the depths of the forest.
{cps=50}On the way home you decide to explore new places, deviating just a little from the familiar road.
{cps=50}The decision, however, turns out to be not very wise, because after about half an hour you realize that you are lost and have no idea of where you are and where to go.
{cps=50}The only option you have in this case is to just keep going in any direction, as at least you are going somewhere.
After about an hour of wandering you stumble upon a small village.
Locals there turn out to be friendly... Perhaps even too friendly - you are welcomed as their dear guest and forced to taste the rustic hospitality in full, despite all your requests to just help with directions.
They sure did show you the road back, but only after the bathhouse, as well as a good feast with all sorts of goodies, drinking, and singing.
{cps=50}All this clearly had a positive effect on your health, but it also took a lot of time.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality increased by 1!
{cps=50}Your way back is unexpectedly blocked by several thuggish-looking peasants.
{cps=50}They demand money for traveling along what they call 'their road' and promise not to hurt you if you pay.
{cps=50}The passage fee is [trait] florins.
{cps=50}You give them the announced amount of money, deciding not to risk in vain.
{cps=50}Despite looking completely unreliable, peasants turn out to be true to their word and let you go without giving you any more trouble.
{cps=50}But sharing your money with a bunch of brazen peasants is the last thing you're going to do.
{cps=50}Negotiations are clearly reaching a dead end, and the issue will have to be resolved by force.
{cps=50}They demand money for traveling along 'their road' and promise not to hurt you if you pay.
{cps=50}The passage fee is 10 florins.
And you don’t have that kind of money.
{cps=50}Hearing this, peasants just shrug their sholders and tell you that in this case they have no choice but to take away and sell all your belongings to somehow compensate for your debt to them.
{cps=50}Naturally, this scenario does not sit right with you and you draw your sword.
Taking advantage of bandits' confusion, you manage to break off the fight and hastily retreat.
{cps=50}Your opponents, who have spent a lot of energy in battle, do not dare to pursue you, allowing you to leave safely.
{cps=50}The rest of your way back goes smoothly without any more adventures.
{cps=50}Selling your hunting prey brings you a small income{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+15 Florins!
{cps=50}Leading your men, you embark on a daring sortie out of the city, hoping to defeat a small band of mercenaries spotted nearby.
{cps=50}Once you have defeated the enemy squad, you rush back to the city before the mercenaries have time to send reinforcements.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Mercenary presence lowered by 1!
{cps=50}Once you have defeated the enemy squad, you rush back to the city before the mercenaries have time to send reinforcements.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Mercenary presence lowered by 2!
{cps=50}Once you have defeated the enemy squad, you rush back to the city before the mercenaries have time to send reinforcements.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Mercenary presence lowered by 3!
{cps=50}Seeing that the battle isn't going in your favor, you decide to retreat with nothing, only trying to save your and your people's lives.
{cps=50}After fighting through the upper quarters, you continue your way to the port, descending into the lower city...
{cps=50}Having dealt with the guards and bounty hunters in the lower quarters, you get to the port...
{cps=50}Among the numerous fishing boats, as well as all kinds of dinghies and longboats, there are indeed a couple of medium-sized ships in the port - most likely merchant cargo ships that arrived in the city.
{cps=50}Your squad immediately rushes to one of them - the one on the deck of which a part of the team was seen.
{cps=50}Your way, however, is blocked again with a detachment of guards, but this time - with a knight at the head.
{cps=50}The last desperate attempt of Rennes' defenders to stop you fails. After breaking through the guards and knights, you successfully board a merchant ship moored in the port.
{cps=50}Its team, though, is not very happy with your appearance on board and, at first, even demands that you get off. However, you quickly manage to convince them.
{cps=50}And soon Rennes is left astern.
{cps=50}According to agreement with the sailors, after three days of travel, your squad is disembarked in one of the ports of northern Aquitaine - out of the reach of Olivia and her people.
{cps=50}You spend the next few years wandering, adventuring, and serving under the banners of various Aquitainian lords and barons.
{cps=50}Already being an eminent mercenary and a famous warrior, you receive the news of another invasion of France by the English army. This time under the command of a young king who recently ascended the throne.
{cps=50}Royal enlisters are actively recruiting mercenaries on the mainland, and you, without any hesitation, head towards the English camp...
{cps=50}The participants of the battle are greeted as heroes and, after your solemn entry into the city, its huge gates, instead of being hastily slammed and shut, remain open for the first time in many months.
{cps=50}You spend several years in these wanderings, earning fame as a famous mercenary, and also get to the southern province of Aquitaine.
{cps=50}When the city's defenses fail completely, everyone is on their own. Militias and civilians, pushing each other, fill the city streets, hurrying to get to the pier - the only escape route.
{cps=50}Organized by the few remaining knights tiny defence squads still hold out in some places, but no matter how bravely they fight, their demise is only a matter of time.
{cps=50}Seeing that the fall of Rennes has become a fait accompli, the remnants of your squad also begin to fall back towards the pier. Unlike the panicking militias, however, your people retreat in an orderly fashion, trying, if possible, to delay the advance of the mercenaries bursting into the city.
{cps=50}Starting to retreat with them, you suddenly remember Olivia. It is completely unknown where the duchess went - it is likely that after the gates were broken through, she could try to hide in the residence, but whether she's there or not - one can only guess.
{cps=50}But there is certainly no doubt that she is in great danger...
{cps=50}Seeing how you look around and as if having read your thoughts, one of the sergeants reminds you that now is not the time for chivalry or rescue of beautiful ladies and asks you not to leave the detachment, saying that without you not only they will die, but also many residents.
{cps=50}Realizing the futility of searching for the duchess, you try not to think of her and focus on the issue of survival and saving your people.
{cps=50}You prefer not to think about what fate now awaits the unfortunate mistress of Rennes.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 50!
{cps=50}Meanwhile, the chaos that has swallowed the city, to some extent, plays into the hands of the defenders - you easily deal with several small detachments of mercenaries who got lost in the narrow streets of the city, thereby buying yourself time to retreat to the port.
{cps=50}At the pier, you manage to board one of the departing ships and soon leave the burning city astern.
{cps=50}{cps=50}According to agreement with the sailors, after three days of travel, your squad is disembarked in one of the ports of northern Aquitaine.
{cps=50}While in France, you have dreamed of returning all the time. But now that it finally happened, instead of joy and satisfaction, you were filled with mixed feelings.
{cps=50}On the one hand, you are finally returning home - safe and sound, in the company of noble people who can easily arrange your future life.
{cps=50}But, on the other hand, the prospects of this very future life seem very vague.
{cps=50}From numerous talks with the earl and the Prince and bits of overheard conversations during your journey back, you didn't make an impression that anything good will come out of the Prince's claim to the throne.
{cps=50}Your opponent, Lord Canterbury, is one of the richest and most influential men in all of England. He was one of those from whom the king himself borrowed money to finance his military adventure on the continent. In addition, for more than a decade, Canterbury has acted as a link between the crown and mercenaries from all over the world, whose services the English monarch regularly resorted to in numerous conflicts.
{cps=50}Despite the fact that you both have returned from France without an army, the lord's huge connections and extensive financial resources guaranteed that in the near future serious forces would flock under his banner.
{cps=50}And all that you have is an empty treasury, a lost war, and the death of a King under very strange circumstances, which can easily be presented and interpreted as you like, making anyone you want guilty.
{cps=50}As for you personally, no specific promises other than a 'generous reward' in case of success were made to you. Therefore, if a week ago, under the walls of Cambrai, the earl's offer to join him seemed to you like manna from heaven, now you are increasingly worried about whether you have made such a decision too hastily.
{cps=50}It is with these sentiments that you arrive in England.
{cps=50}After disembarking from the ship in Dover and a day of non-stop riding, your party of less than a dozen people arrives at Dartford Castle - one of the royal family estates, located about 40 miles southwest of London.
{cps=50}It was decided to abandon the initially discussed idea of going straight to the capital, due to its excessive danger. Canterbury, who arrived a few days earlier than you, probably went exactly there, and God only knows what kind of greeting he managed to prepare for you.
{cps=50}Exhausted by the long journey, you are happy about the decision, seeing it as an opportunity to finally catch your breath.
{cps=50}Yes, this is certainly not a palace, but after six months in tents in the open air, it's better than nothing.
{cps=50}Dartford never was a royal residence in the proper meaning. It served more as hunting grounds. So don't go around looking for golden chandeliers or linen of thick silk, if you know what I mean.
{cps=50}No thick silk, huh. I was puzzled for a moment, but only until I saw the maids. Now I understand where all the thickness went. And I also understand why your father loved going 'hunting' so much. You don't need silk linen with these kinds of girls if YOU know what I mean. Ha-ha-ha!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Grinning, the Prince notices you.
{cps=50}Hey, [name]! Come in, come in. How do you like the place?
{cps=50}If this is enough to impress you, then just wait until we get to a proper residence - your jaw's gonna be on the floor.
{cps=50}I'm telling you - show him royal hair on a royal arse and watch him talk about that all day!
{cps=50}Alright. Let's get to business. The path to the throne, as you can see, starts from somewhat afar. London is only 20 miles away, but I'm afraid those 20 miles could easily be the longest in my life.
{cps=50}It's a fancy place. But not much, to be honest.
{cps=50}Not impressed? That's okay, this is only the beginning. The path to the throne, as you can see, starts from somewhat afar.
{cps=50}London is only 20 miles away, but I'm afraid those 20 miles could easily be the longest in my life.
{cps=50}We'll get there.
{cps=50}We definitely will. And do you know why, [name]?
{cps=50}Why?
{cps=50}Because we've got a plan.
{cps=50}Of course you do.
{cps=50}We don't really know what Canterbury...
{cps=50}That bastard!
{cps=50}...is planning. But it is safe to say that he will do anything in his power to stop me from getting the crown.
{cps=50}And for that he will need the help of the Parliament...
{cps=50}Those imbeciles!
{cps=50}And honestly, he may very well get it. As Parliament is filled not just with imbeciles, but with imbeciles notorious for their thirst for power and gold. And he might promise them just that.
{cps=50}So what do we do?
{cps=50}Our task is simpler in some sense. We only have to do one thing - cut the head off this treacherous bastard.
{cps=50}But we can't just do it, can we?
{cps=50}Why do I feel like there is a trick?
{cps=50}There's always a trick if you've got a tiny...
{cps=50}There is no trick here, [name]. But there is something to... consider.
{cps=50}I doubt Canterbury already possesses an army at this point, but he soon will. He is a very rich and resourceful person.
{cps=50}Do we have an army?
{cps=50}Oh, even better. We've got you.
{cps=50}Yes, at this point you're pretty much the only fighting force we command. Which, knowing you, is of course a lot - but still not enough to challenge Canterbury in an open field.
{cps=50}This is why, while Canterbury is occupied with getting the Parliament on his side, we've got some force building to do.
{cps=50}Calling the banners once again and starting to gather men from all across the country is rather pointless. Because, firstly, the war has considerably depleted the kingdom's resources, and instead of skilled fighters we'll be getting a bunch of useless scrubs.
{cps=50}And, secondly, which is even more important - we simply don't have the time. Raising an army in a conventional way takes months to even get going. And that is more than enough time for Canterbury to hire several hundreds of skilled mercenaries and just crush us piece by piece.
{cps=50}Exactly. The situation is not easy. But, luckily for you, we've already got a plan.
{cps=50}We need to act fast, which means we'll have to work with what we have close by. Our task is to win favor with the local lords, whose castles and estates are located around London.
{cps=50}There's quite a few wealthy people among them, who have their own personal forces - a couple dozens of well-armed and well-trained men plus auxiliaries. Get them all to support us - and all of a sudden we have a small but capable army.
{cps=50}But where do I fit in all this? I'm not that good of a negotiator. And lords most likely won't even share a table with me...
But don't underestimate yourself. The fact that you're a filthy commoner and not a noble does not mean that you can't be useful.
{cps=50}I'll do the negotiating. My good friend Northampton here will take care of the logistics. And you, [name], will be occupied with... a delicate matter.
{cps=50}A delicate matter?
{cps=50}Not far from here, in Greenwich, there's the estate of the Count of Caldwell. The old man himself is already well over sixty - he's somewhat distraught and prefers to live a rather... secluded life.
{cps=50}He could be a valuable ally... Not him personally, of course, but his men and his estate. Greenwich is pretty much at the doorstep of London - perfectly placed to conduct any operations against the city. We could gather forces there and use it as a fortified stronghold if necessary.
{cps=50}But how the hell am I supposed to convince the senile count to do that!? He probably won't even want to see me!
{cps=50}You're underestimating us, boy.
{cps=50}We've got it all figured out.
{cps=50}There's just this little detail that you're not aware of yet, [name].
{cps=50}The old man has a daughter.
{cps=50}During the French campaign we couldn't help but notice that you were... Fighting some battles on the love front as well.
{cps=50}We even made a bet on how soon that medic girl would brush you off.
{cps=50}I thought you wouldn't last a week.
{cps=50}I thought you wouldn't last a day.
{cps=50}Thanks for that. It's always nice to see the commanders believing in their own soldiers.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [genius_idea.name]!
{cps=50}With a lute in your hands and a confused expression on your face, you don't really look much like a resident of one of the local abbeys.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check indecisive!]
{cps=50}When you're pretty much ready to give up the chase and leave this maze, you hear a sudden rustle behind your back.
{cps=50}Everything happens way too fast, not leaving you even a slight chance to dodge the incoming strike.
{cps=50}Looks can be deceiving, [name]. My skin is soft, and my hands are not covered with calluses from weapons. But I have shed no less blood than you.
{cps=50}On your way to Greenwich, which is about two hours of ride from Dartford, you once again go through the instructions that the prince and the earl gave you.
{cps=50}As per them, the young countess Alyssa Caldwell is pretty much the only person whom her aged father trusts and listens to. Which means that the quickest way to get the count on our side - is by making his daughter... sympathetic to our cause.
{cps=50}According to the plan, you are to appear at her court under the guise of a knight who has just returned from France. Which, luckily, should not require any special acting skills on your part...
{cps=50}News from overseas will naturally attract a fair amount of attention to your person and provide a solid reason for you to be personally presented to the countess. After that, as the Prince said, it's all on you.
{cps=50}Your arrival at the Greenwich castle, as expected, immediately causes a considerable stir.
{cps=50}You are immediately taken to one of the central halls, where you are introduced to the count - an elderly, but still not decrepit man with a very displeased look, surrounded by a large retinue. Your arrival catches him in the process of getting ready to depart somewhere.
{cps=50}Finding yourself almost face to face with him, you do not intend to lose your chance. You're already mentally preparing to describe to him the treachery and betrayal of Lord Canterbury in the most vivid colors and then single-handedly convince the count to side with the prince.
{cps=50}However, much to your surprise, the old man glances at you without even remote interest and then says that he's already got hunting scheduled for today. And you - with whatever it is you want - can come tomorrow. Or, even better, the day after. Or, maybe, early next week.
{cps=50}With that said, Caldwell and his retinue depart, leaving you alone.
{cps=50}At that moment, when you are about to go back with nothing, she suddenly appears.
{cps=50}Please do not be angry with my father. He had to go through many wars and intrigues in his young years, so recently he has somewhat lost interest in them.
{cps=50}And even more so that we have plenty of our own wars and intrigues in Greenwich, these days. Enough for export.
{cps=50}My name is Alyssa. Alyssa Caldwell. I am the daughter of the Earl of Caldwell and, simultaneously, the only person who maintains at least some semblance of order in here.
{cps=50}And you, as I understand it, just got back from France? What did you say your name is?
{cps=50}My name is [name]. I am one of Earl Northampton's knights. We returned from the continent just a couple of days ago.
{cps=50}Is that so? And is the war over then? So did we... did we win?
{cps=50}To be honest, I am not particularly aware of what is happening, and the news that reached us was for the most part extremely inconclusive and contradictory.
{cps=50}I wouldn't mind if you told me about your exploits. If, of course, you have something to tell about.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Starting your story with the arrival of the royal army in Dunkirk, you quickly realize that Alyssa indeed has a very poor understanding of the events unfolding on the continent, and therefore can hardly distinguish between truth and lies...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Despite this, you do not fib and retell your adventures to her for what they are.{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}Yeah. All these preparations and efforts just to hang around under the walls of some wretched town for several months... And then to find your death there.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The practice of starting relationships with lies is slowly becoming a habit for you.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}While briefly retelling the events of recent months to her, you allow yourself to exaggerate your own merits a little...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}All the successes achieved by the English were obviously possible only thanks to you. While all the failures happened only because you simply were not able to keep track of everything and be present in all places at the same time.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Surprisingly, the girl seems to believe your words.
{cps=50}What an entertaining story. So you are a hero! It's even strange that I've never heard your name before...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 15!{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 20!
{cps=50}This was my first campaign. Any legend must have a beginning.
{cps=50}Well, the beginning is really great then. The war is lost, the King is dead, and, according to your words, there is a traitor sitting in London.
{cps=50}Perhaps you should have stayed in France, for I am afraid to even imagine what awaits us next.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You immediately remember the Prince's words about the impending threat of the Scottish army, as well as the prospect of a bloody civil war.
{cps=50}Honestly, I have seen such a disaster only once in my life. The year before last, my father tried to marry me off to the son of the Earl of Essex, and I managed to fall off my horse, right in front of the future groom, when I was brought to be wooed.
{cps=50}And right into a huge spring puddle that was.
{cps=50}Of course, the wedding did not take place. The Earl of Essex said that he was not going to marry a 'dirty girl'... Although his father liked me exactly because of this...
{cps=50}But, as they say, there is nothing to be done. Although the option was very good, as I really love Essex. It is what it is.
{cps=50}Honestly, since then I certainly try to stay away from horses.
{cps=50}Don't get me wrong - I love riding. Just not this kind of riding.
{cps=50}What a story. It honestly might've been even more of a disaster than the whole French campaign.
{cps=50}Exactly. It's nice to see an understanding person every once in a while.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 5!
{cps=50}Your head seems not that empty for an empty-headed knight, as one could assume at first.
{cps=50}Thank you for the compliment... If it was, of course, a compliment.
{cps=50}Phew, I see you are clearly not used to communicating with the nobility. Everything that I am telling you is a compliment just for the fact that I am addressing you.
{cps=50}I will take note.
{cps=50}Good boy.
{cps=50}Hmmm, but if you think about it, then maybe your arrival in Greenwich is exactly what I was missing.
{cps=50}In what sense?
{cps=50}The surrounding lands have slowly but surely sunk into primitive chaos over the past year.
{cps=50}It all started shortly before you left for this stupid war.
{cps=50}During his military preparations, the late King literally robbed the peasants to the bone, imposing all kinds of taxes on them.
{cps=50}The sheriffs were not particularly nice to the locals while collecting money, and so, even before Edward's departure to France, mass rebellions began throughout the area.
{cps=50}It was not that bad at first, but after the King left for the war, taking most of the knights and soldiers with him, there was no one to keep the raging bastards in check.
{cps=50}And then some Duncan person appeared from among them, who formed almost a full-fledged army from the bandits.
{cps=50}This scoundrel calls himself the 'Prince of Thieves' and almost openly threatens the surrounding castles and cities, demanding money 'for protection from bandits' - that is, from themselves!
{cps=50}And that's not the worst part. The people of this Duncan share a part of the loot with the peasants, who are dissatisfied with the authorities and, in exchange, are ready to supply and cover the bandits.
{cps=50}My people have already raided them several times, but the best they could catch was a couple of small fries. And at worst, like it was a month ago, my own soldiers were ambushed and had to run for their lives.
{cps=50}Some filthy peasants make us live in fear on our own land! Boggles my mind!
{cps=50}And is there really no one who would be able to deal with them?
{cps=50}My father, in his best years, would have crushed them in the blink of an eye. But now he doesn't care about anything except hunting and wine.
{cps=50}And what about the Sheriff? Why don't you ask him for help?
{cps=50}Seriously? Do you think that we are all complete dolts here? This is the first thing I did.
{cps=50}And?
{cps=50}And nothing. The Sheriff has been catching this Duncan for two months now, but to no avail.
{cps=50}And I have a strange feeling that he is not trying too hard since the Sheriff prefers to conduct most of his searches without leaving his home.
{cps=50}Hmmm...
{cps=50}Let's be honest. From your story, I gathered that you and the young prince need the help of my father's people.
{cps=50}You can seek a meeting with him all you want, but I will tell you right away - it won't get you anywhere. Because I handle all the things here.
{cps=50}And I am willing to help you, but only if you help me.
{cps=50}Bringing the rightful King to the throne is, of course, an important matter, but as long as my own lands are ravaged by bandits, I absolutely do not give a damn about any problems of the crown.
{cps=50}We are experiencing a literal invasion of barbarians here. Help me stop the bandits from sinking these lands back into the Dark Ages.
{cps=50}And I, in turn, guarantee you that all of my father's vassals will side with you in the war for the crown.
{cps=50}It looks like I have no choice.
{cps=50}Hey, where is your enthusiasm! Any of the local knights would have been delighted with the opportunity of running an errand for me. Consider it an honor.
{cps=50}So, the Sheriff should be the starting point - if this scoundrel is really helping the bandits, then the matter will not get off the ground until we get rid of him.
{cps=50}But how do we know if he is involved?
{cps=50}Relax. I understand that you are a knight and thinking is not your forte. I have calculated everything - I already have a plan.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The mere mention of the word 'plan' makes your eye twitch a little as Northampton's and Prince Edward's grinning sly faces appear in your head.
{cps=50}You will go to his estate disguised as a tax collector and conduct a small... Audit of his assets.
{cps=50}If the rogues pay him, then we are talking about large sums. And big money tends to leave traces.
{cps=50}Well, that's great. Don't disappoint me. For I severely punish those who let me down.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [dark_age.name]!{vspace=5}Quest added - [death_and_taxes.name]!
{cps=50}Got it. Can you still punish me if I succeed though? Just to make it clear.
{cps=50}Just go already!
{cps=50}Finding the Sheriff's estate, located near Greenwich, is not at all difficult.
{cps=50}However, having already arrived at the place, you suddenly realize that you do not really have a detailed plan of action. And if the Sheriff (or even his people) wouldn't buy into your tax collector disguise and let you in, then there would be nothing you could do.
{cps=50}Moreover, it suddenly dawns on you that the Sheriff, who in fact is an official in the royal service, is much closer to the tax authorities than you are. And, potentially, he may even know the local tax officials in person.
{cps=50}But it's too late to turn back to rethink the plan anyway, and you have no choice but to act blindly, relying solely on luck.
{cps=50}Upon arrival at the estate, you are immediately struck by the impressive number of guards and servants there. The Sheriff's house is clearly full of life.
{cps=50}The opportunity to test your theory is given to you almost immediately - on one of the servants and a couple of guards accompanying him, who meet you at the gate.
{cps=50}Attentively listening to your story, he looks you up and down, closely examining certain items of clothing and equipment.
{cps=50}You subconsciously prepare to be exposed, but to your great surprise, the servant unexpectedly nods to you and orders to let you in. {vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check passed!]
{cps=50}He tells you that the Sheriff is now busy with important guests, but you can wait for him in one of the inner rooms.
{cps=50}You subconsciously prepare to be exposed and are not really surprised when the servant states that you look like someone who works with swords, not with papers.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check failed!]
{cps=50}Realizing that you have to improvise, you go all-in and ask the servant to let you in for a little while for pay. Promising, of course, that you will not steal anything.
{cps=50}He says that he cannot let you inside under any excuse. But you can see it in his cunning eyes that the servant is somewhat of a businessman himself.
{cps=50}Turns out that the Sheriff is waiting for a courier from one of the barons living across the river, who is supposed to deliver him 250 Florins as payment for a service.
{cps=50}And if the servant is to squint his eyes, he can for sure imagine that you are this very courier bringing said sum. And while he and his guards are counting everything, you might just have an opportunity to slip inside unnoticed.
{cps=50}You give the money to the servant and, as promised, he lets you into one of the inner rooms of the estate. Before that, however, he also forces you to promise that in five minutes you will disappear from here without a trace.
{cps=50}After informing the servant that you are interested in his proposition, you promise to return with the money a little later.
{cps=50}The room you are escorted to turns out to be littered with all sorts of things. Here, according to the servant, all parcels addressed to the Sheriff are brought, which he then examines and decides what to do with them.
{cps=50}In response to your request to let you into one of the premises closer to the chambers of the owner of the estate, you receive a strict refusal.
{cps=50}It seems that if you are to find any clues, then you will have to look for them here.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A large bastard sword with an ornate sheath and a blade of very high quality steel.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}This is certainly not a cheap thing, but someone like the Sheriff can well afford it.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A huge wrought-iron chest, sealed with a lock.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You aren't able to look inside, although you would very much like to.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A rack with pitchforks, spears, and halberds of all kinds.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}They bear little resemblance to what the Sheriff himself would use. Most likely this is something from the arsenal of his guards or servants.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Two impressive sized boxes. Both are tightly sealed.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Half a dozen bottles of different kinds of alcohol.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}All with labels and markings indicating high quality.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not quite up to Château de Lambert quality, but tavern drunks are definitely not served this. Someone clearly spent a tidy sum on the contents of these bottles.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Coincidence? I think not.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A huge embroidered carpet.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A luxury, definitely brought from somewhere far away.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Only a barbarian would walk on that piece of art. It's incomprehensible why that thing would be on the floor.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}It may have been unrolled for show.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Sheriff can hardly afford such riches. Unless, of course, this is a family heirloom, inherited from some crusader ancestors...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}All sorts of rubbish, among which a small metal key is unexpectedly found.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}An impressive chest covered with numerous engravings.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Locked with a key.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}After opening the lock with a small metal key, you carefully examine the contents of the chest. For the most part, these are all kinds of clobber - almost all of fabrics that feel expensive to the touch.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The upper layers turn out to be not very interesting, but on several items of clothing hidden below you find large dirty burgundy stains, reminiscent of traces of blood.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A small purse full of coins - including gold ones.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}In order to keep it out in the open, you need to be a person of a very specific character and position.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Or of a very outstanding affluence.
{cps=50}You would like to continue your search, however, when the servant appears in the room and announces that the Sheriff will soon be ready to meet you, you realize that it is time to get out.
{cps=50}After all, a personal meeting with the Sheriff is not part of your plans. And therefore, you have to be content with only the information that has been already collected.
{cps=50}You go back.
{cps=50}Despite your desire to continue exploring the room, the servant declares that the time you bought is up and demands that you get the hell out.
{cps=50}It is pointless to argue with him and the guards who stand behind him, and therefore you have to put an end to your investigation and turn back with what little information you managed to collect.
{cps=50}So many people gather to watch the upcoming fight that it seems as if not only the whole of Greenwich and Dartford is here, but also a good half of London and its suburbs.
{cps=50}You have no idea who told all these people about the duel.
{cps=50}At one point, it even seems to you that out of the corner of your eye, you can see the prince and the earl sitting on the side wooden tribune, surrounded by commoners.
{cps=50}People's servants for sure...
{cps=50}The Sheriff, whom you see for the first time a couple of minutes before the fight, turns out to be a hefty man with a shaggy red beard and a totally thuggish mug.
{cps=50}You immediately catch yourself thinking that the conclusion about his involvement in the affairs of the bandits could easily be made just by looking at him.
{cps=50}After extensive introductions and the recitation of the regalia of both duelists, Joffrey, acting as the master of ceremonies for the entire event, declares the start of the first duel.
{cps=50}The Sheriff falls to the ground from your blow and does not get up.
{cps=50}His weapons and armor become your rightful reward.
{cps=50}The sound of the herald's trumpet announces that the first duel is drawing to a close.
{cps=50}The first duel did not reveal a winner and the duelists were given a short break in order to change weapons before the next fight.
{cps=50}Looking around, you expect to see the glee of spectators in the stands, but the emotions of the audience are rather mixed, and many of them are clearly unhappy with this turn of events.
{cps=50}However, thinking about how at this very moment the poison in the Sheriff's wounds slowly goes into his bloodstream, you realize that you are hardly in a position to complain about anything.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 20!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Stepping over the body, which the servants have not yet managed to pull aside, Alyssa goes straight to you.
{cps=50}Honestly, I'm not even surprised at this point. How the hell am I even supposed to compare you to my own knights after this?
{cps=50}The difference is just... astonishing.
{cps=50}In every department.
{cps=50}You shouldn't be that harsh on your own men. Maybe this is the reason they can't deal with the bandits - you just don't believe in them enough.
{cps=50}How diplomatic. Your soldiers probably liked it.
I honestly have no idea how can I even compare you to my own knights after this. The difference is just... astonishing.
In every department.
It's really starting to look like the king took all the best toys with him to France. And all I was left here with is a bunch of near-useless dudes who can only ride horses and poke stuff with their sharp sticks.
I mean, I'm okay with the riding and poking stuff with sticks part, but... But you really showed that there's a lot more to being a knight than just that.
{cps=50}You must be armed with a sword.
{cps=50}You must be armed with an axe.
{cps=50}You must be armed with a bludgeoning weapon.
{cps=50}You must be armed with a spear.
{cps=50}You must be armed with a halberd.
{cps=50}Hey, [name]! How's your love affair going?
{cps=50}Relationships are a subtle matter, I understand. But do not drag it out - we simply don't have time to tip-toe around.
{cps=50}What's so hard about it anyway!? Confidently approach her, take her hand, tell her... Well, what do they usually say in such cases?
{cps=50}You can handle it, I'm sure.
{cps=50}Thanks for the advice.
{cps=50}No need to thank me. I have already deducted five pence for the consultation from your salary.
{cps=50}Okay, let's get down to business. We are hearing disturbing news from the north. It is said that Canterbury sent envoys to the Scots.
{cps=50}I don't know what exactly he is up to, but if what we hear is true, then it smells like a full-fledged war.
{cps=50}My father had many enemies, both external and internal.
{cps=50}Now that he is dead, and we are extremely vulnerable, they will all begin to stick out their noses and rush to gather under the banner of Canterbury.
{cps=50}In the long run, under the worst circumstances, this can easily turn into a protracted confrontation. We cannot allow this to happen.
{cps=50}Exactly. This means that we need not only to crush the rebels, but also to do it as demonstratively as possible.
{cps=50}To give everyone a little taste of what exactly awaits anyone who dares to take up arms against the rightful king.
{cps=50}Got it. So how are we going to do it?
{cps=50}As the earl and I went through the old maps this morning, we remembered a very remarkable place west of Dartford.
{cps=50}Lindisfarne Abbey, have you heard of it?
{cps=50}Do not strain your brain, boy. I know you haven’t. This abbey has been half-abandoned for a couple of decades, but once upon a time history was made there.
{cps=50}Several closest vassals of William of Normandy, the Conqueror, were buried in this place.
{cps=50}But, more importantly, according to legend, it was in Lindisfarne that the Sword of Justice was kept.
{cps=50}Sword of Justice? I think I heard something about it...
{cps=50}This is the exact ritual sword that was used to execute traitors since the time of Danelag. And with this sword King Alfred personally cut off the heads of four princes who agreed to help the Vikings capture England.
{cps=50}This thing must be almost five hundred years old!
{cps=50}It is quite possible that even more than that. I would not be surprised if the Romans chopped heads off the rebellious Celtic leaders with it.
{cps=50}This is a significant thing, the symbolic value of which cannot be overestimated.
{cps=50}The very fact that we have the Sword of Justice in our hands will make everyone understand who exactly is the legitimate ruler of the kingdom. And if we also manage to execute Canterbury with it, then the authority of the rebels and everything connected to them will be totally undermined.
{cps=50}But how would this help us against the Scots?
{cps=50}It would help at least by deterring the locals from joining them.
{cps=50}Even if the rumors about the imminent invasion of the Scottish forces are not a lie, we can always repel them by combining the efforts of the entire kingdom.
{cps=50}And this is precisely our task - not to let these lands, which have been gathered together for so long, crack at the seams.
{cps=50}So don't waste your time and immediately go for the sword. {vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [the_sword.name]!
{cps=50}Despite you having a map, as well as personal instructions from the earl, the search for the abbey still takes a fair amount of time, and only after wandering around for a while do you manage to finally get to it.
{cps=50}Located on a large hill, Lindisfarne turns out to be a whole complex of once majestic buildings, most of which already look pretty decayed and half-abandoned.
{cps=50}However, looking around inside a little, you quickly enough detect signs of life here, and quite active at that. In one of the more preserved parts of the abbey, you find monks, as well as several peasants near a large food cart.
As you head towards them, out of the corner of your eye you notice one more thing - and this time it's very unpleasant. In the distance to the north, a large cloud of dust is visible, slowly floating on the horizon.
{cps=50}You are still unable to see the riders who kick up the dust, but judging by the size of the cloud, there are no less than half a dozen of them.
{cps=50}It is also unclear who they are and where exactly they are heading, but something immediately tells you that their intentions are certainly not good.
{cps=50}Approaching a group of monks, you ask one of them to lead you to the abbot.
{cps=50}The monks, however, look at you with suspicion and are not in a hurry to fulfill your request, in turn asking numerous questions about who you are and why you came to Lindisfarne.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check failed!]
{cps=50}The answers you give do not inspire much confidence in them, and the next five, ten, and then fifteen minutes pass in fruitless negotiations.
{cps=50}According to the monks, the area is full of bandits from among the rebellious peasants, who are even recently joined by some renegade knights. Insolent due to impunity, these characters now do not shy away from attacking not only road caravans and lonely travelers but even mansions and monasteries - which explains the distrust of the inhabitants of Lindisfarne towards strangers.
{cps=50}Realizing that otherwise it will not be possible to get things off the ground, you show the monks the royal seal you received from the Prince. According to the instructions, it was supposed to be presented exclusively to the abbot - in order to convince him to hand over the sword to you.
{cps=50}In order to avoid drawing too much attention, the Prince recommended that you do not show it to strangers. However, as you watch the cloud of dust continue to approach the abbey, you realize that you have no choice at all.
{cps=50}The seal, albeit not immediately, but still helps you convince the monks and you are taken to the abbot.
{cps=50}After listening to you, whilst also carefully studying the seal, he initially reacts to your request without much enthusiasm. But when you convey to him the Prince's promise to rebuild the abbey and restore it to its former greatness, the abbot quickly changes his position. Expressing his willingness to support the Prince, he agrees to hand the sword over to you.
{cps=50}Discerning a worthy person in you, the monks take you to the abbot without further questioning.
{cps=50}You tell him in all the details about the purpose of your visit and also show the royal seal received from the Prince. {vspace=5} According to the instructions, it was supposed to be shown exclusively to the abbot - in order to convince him to hand you the sword.
{cps=50}While one of the novices goes to retrieve it, the abbot urges several monks to immediately start praying for the success of your endeavor.
{cps=50}This kind of support immediately gives you strength, both spiritual and physical. {vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!{vspace=5}Vitality increased by 1!
dsd
!
{cps=50}Joffrey turns out to be almost an elderly man, acting as a herald for more than three decades.
{cps=50}Alyssa warned him about your visit, and he, without wasting time, immediately fills you in.
{cps=50}Duels are conducted according to a strict code of rules and any deviation from it is punishable by dishonor and universal censure. One can enumerate the rules endlessly, but the list of the most key ones is as follows.
{cps=50}During the battle, it is allowed to use only pre-agreed weapons: for example, if both duelists agreed to fight with swords, then both can only be with swords. No axes or spears.
{cps=50}It is forbidden to use any poisons or poisonous potions.
{cps=50}Bows and crossbows are prohibited.
{cps=50}The first duel continues until the death or surrender of one of the duelists, or until the time runs out.
{cps=50}During the break between fights, the duelists are supposed to replace the weapon with the one that meets the agreed conditions of the second fight.
{cps=50}In between fights, duelists can replace broken or damaged shields and pieces of equipment.
{cps=50}In between fights, first aid can be provided to the duelists. However, serious injuries cannot be healed.
{cps=50}In between fights, duelists can rest and recuperate as much as they can.
{cps=50} Finally! Took you bloody long enough.
{cps=50}What's the news?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You tell Alyssa in detail about the results of your trip to the Sheriff.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Despite the fact that you were able to inspect only one room, you managed to see quite a lot in it.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Strangely enough, the countess doesn't seem to be that surprised by your story.
{cps=50}Good job, [name]. Actually, I thought so. Everything suggests that this bastard is in on it.
{cps=50}We are given a free hand now. It's time to get rid of him.
{cps=50}And how are we going to do it?
{cps=50}Why are you asking me!? Aren't you supposed to be in charge of dealing with these kinds of issues?
{cps=50}Didn't you just, like, return from a war and stuff?
{cps=50}Well, alright, I guess. Since I'm making the calls, why don't we just...
{cps=50}Gotcha! Did you really think that I would let YOU make the calls?
{cps=50}I've decided on everything already. Yesterday I sent a letter to the Sheriff with your signature on it, in which you tell him that you're banging his wife, consider him a traitor to the crown, and also want to duel him to death.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Alyssa's facial experession can hardly hide her disappointment.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}What can I say? I expected more, that's for sure.
{cps=50}God be my witness, that's not what I was counting on when I challenged the Sheriff to a duel on your behalf.
{cps=50}When you did what!?
{cps=50}Challenged him to a duel. I thought there'd be some solid evidence of his involvement with Duncan's bandits.
{cps=50}This is why yesterday I sent a letter to the Sheriff with your signature on it, where you basically tell him that you're banging his wife, consider him a traitor to the crown, and also want to duel him to death.
{cps=50}WHAT!?
{cps=50}What of it!? We've got no time to waste. But we do have a Sheriff...
{cps=50}And you should be thanking me for saving you the trouble of thinking about anything. I've heard knights tend to have trouble with that.
{cps=50}And, on top of that, you probably would've come up with some lame-ass assassination plan. Cloaks and daggers and stuff.
{cps=50}But who the hell would want to see that? The duels, on the other hand, are quite entertaining.
{cps=50}Damn, I just remembered that the Sheriff is actually considered to be a pretty decent fighter. My father once called him the best duelist of the south...
{cps=50}A little oopsie on my part. But you can do it, right?
{cps=50}Ri-i-i-ight?
{cps=50}I've been in some battles. I can hold my end up.
{cps=50}That's an interesting choice of words. I love it when a man can hold his end up.
{cps=50}And I also love a man who can obey orders from his mistress.
{cps=50}Tell me, [name], are you an obedient one?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Despite the growing weirdness of her antics, you keep your eyes on the prize.
{cps=50}I'm ready to obey your every order.
{cps=50}That's cute. I love them obedient.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 10!
{cps=50}Y-yes? I guess?
{cps=50}I'm not sure, but I might be. Probably...
{cps=50}Are you b... Are you blushing?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 3!
{cps=50}No way.
{cps=50}But you are.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 3!
{cps=50}That's objectively impossible.
{cps=50}I'm not blind, you know. You're red as a tomato. I almost wanna bite you.
{cps=50}Oh my god, this is cute!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 3!
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}It's a...
{cps=50}It's a little hot in here.
{cps=50}We're outside, [name], and it's windy.
{cps=50}I'm literally holding my dress with both my hands so it doesn't fly away.
{cps=50}Not that I mind my dress flying away before your eyes... But you know - appearances and stuff.
{cps=50}Lord, you're blushing even more. I'm sorry, baby, did I say something?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 3!
{cps=50}I'm not blushing! I'm just... Concerned. Concerned, yes. About the Sheriff - I had no idea he was the best duelist in this part of the kingdom.
{cps=50}Oh I see, I see. So it was the Sheriff that got you all hot and heavy, eh? He's got a wife, you know. Doubt she'd be into that. But then again - some girls are...
{cps=50}Jesus Christ! That's not what I meant!
{cps=50}It's okay. I don't judge.
{cps=50}I'm kidding, of course.
But let me just say this - if you play your cards right, then soon you might have a wife too.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 3!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quite puzzled by Alyssa's antics, you intend to let her know that you won't be playing by her rules.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}But as you're about to tell her off, the only thing that you're able to utter is some incomprehensible mumbling.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She, of course, interprets this in her own way.
{cps=50}Oh, you poor thing! Am I going too fast? Alright, alright, let's remain 'just friends' for another episode or two.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Suddenly a maid appears out of nowhere and hands Alyssa a sealed envelope. Then, having whispered something into the countesses' ear, she disappears.
{cps=50}And here's the Sheriff's reply. Swift as expected. Rushing to meet his own demise...
{cps=50}As my father likes to say:{i} When death comes knocking at your door, don't be in a hurry to answer.{/i}{w}{vspace=5}Let's see what the Sheriff has to say.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}...
{cps=50}Oh my, it looks like your words really got to him. Maybe even too much.
{cps=50}Especially that part where you vividly described your bedroom adventures with his wife.
{cps=50}By my standards, on the other hand...
{cps=50}Two stages. The first one is with weapons of your choosing. He picks weapons for the second one.
{cps=50}First stage lasts for a quarter of an hour. If you both survive, then the second stage lasts...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}For a brief second, something changes in Alyssa's face, and - for the first time since you've met - you see her serious and concerned.
{cps=50}Lasts until the death of one the duelists.
{cps=50}Don't even dare to die, got it?
{cps=50}Sheriff chooses swords. Both one- and two-handed ones are allowed.
{cps=50}Sheriff chooses axes. Both one- and two-handed ones are allowed.
{cps=50}Sheriff chooses bludgeoning weapons. All kinds of maces or warhammers are allowed.
{cps=50}Sheriff chooses spears.
{cps=50}Sheriff chooses halberds.
{cps=50}You too will have to pick a weapon.
{cps=50}I won't ask for your reply right away. Something tells me that you might need some time to think it over.
{cps=50}Tell me when you are ready and I'll send a response letter to the Sheriff.
{cps=50}Meanwhile, talk to Joffrey - my herald. He'll tell you all about the rules for the duel as I never really could keep them in mind.
{cps=50}And, by the way, you can also pay a visit to the Greenwich armory - I'll tell my people to let you in. It's not the Tower, of course, but there might be something useful.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [mortal_combat.name!ti]!
{cps=50}So? Are you ready?
{cps=50}I made my choice.
{cps=50}I choose swords.
{cps=50}I choose axes.
{cps=50}I choose maces.
{cps=50}I choose spears.
{cps=50}I choose halbers.
{cps=50}Alright. The first stage of the duel will be held with the weapons of your choosing. Maybe try not to, you know, let it lead to the second one...
{cps=50}I'll send a letter to the Sheriff. Pretty sure he won't make us wait long.
{cps=50}I'm ready to fight.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have to be armed with a sword.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have to be armed with an axe.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have to be armed with a mace or another bludgeoning weapon.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have to be armed with a spear.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have to be armed with a halberd.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}There must be a sword in your inventory for the second stage of the duel.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}There must be an axe in your inventory for the second stage of the duel.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}There must be a bludgeoning weapon in your inventory for the second stage of the duel.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}There must be a spear in your inventory for the second stage of the duel.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}There must be a halberd in your inventory for the second stage of the duel.
{cps=50}Try to come back in one piece, please. Please.
{cps=50}Well, hello-hello. Welcome back, mister hero.
{cps=50}Aren't you the hot topic? The whole Greenwich is talking about how you single-handedly dealt with those bandits.
{cps=50}I have no clue how you pulled that off. I'm impressed actually.
{cps=50}Maybe some heroes are real after all.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 20!{vspace=5}+150 Florins
{cps=50}Fascinating stuff.
{cps=50}Well, that's basically what I do. Breaking ass and kicking hearts. O-o-ops, that came out wrong...
{cps=50}Oh, it's okay. Don't apologize.{w} I've been there myself.
{cps=50}You mean mixing up your words or...?
{cps=50}I think that's too many questions.{w} So. Let me see...
{cps=50}The bandits are still quite far from being completely defeated, but the roads are definitely safer now. Which is a serious win in my book.
{cps=50}After we got rid of Duncan, it's already been pretty quiet around here. I think these guys might've been the last remnants of his brigade.
{cps=50}Good job. If I do say so myself.
{cps=50}Alright. Now - off you go. I've got dress-fitting and afternoon gossip with my girlfriends scheduled around this time.
{cps=50}I'll be seeing you. Hero.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You and Alyssa have nothing to talk about at the moment.
{cps=50}So? Did you reach an... understanding with the countess?
{cps=50}Not yet, but I'm working on it. She's a... peculiar character. I might have to spend some time running errands for her, before... Well, you know.
{cps=50}Running errands? For a girl? Really, [name]?
{cps=50}That's slightly pathetic, [name].
{cps=50}But we want her to help us, right!? There's no other way around then!
{cps=50}Let me tell you something: chase a bag, kid, never chase a dame.
{cps=50}Straight up.
{cps=50}Hey, and what the hell have you two done lately!? You were supposed to get the castle full of soldiers but as of now, it is still full of only those thick-ass maids. Not that I'm complaining but...
{cps=50}Relax, [name]. You obviously have no idea how an army is gathered. These things take time.
{cps=50}We're actively negotiating but are yet to achieve a significant result... But we've already come up with a plan.
{cps=50}And you play the main role in it.{w} Were supposed to play it, at least. But it seems that the countess got you on a leash already.
{cps=50}Does she at least call you a good boy, when bossing you around?
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}Is it just me or do you sound a little envious?
{cps=50}Hey. I think I actually remember that girl. Alyssa Caldwell - I've met her a while back before the war.
{cps=50}I did kind of like her, to be honest. Even though she was a foul-mouthed two-faced minx who always acted like royalty.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}But she is sort of royalty, isn't she?
{cps=50}The only royal thing about her is her ass, my man.
{cps=50}Alright. Go get her and her father on our side and we will deal with the rest.
{cps=50}Offensive stance will increase the hit probability of your melee attacks but will lower the chances of evading enemy strikes.{vspace=5}The higher your Weapon Skill - the higher this stance increases your hit probability.{vspace=5}Offensive stance is also very vulnerable to enemy feints.
{cps=50}Defensive stance will boost all of your defense, increasing both the chances to dodge an enemy attack and to block it with a shield. However, it will also lower the hit probability of your own attacks.{vspace=5}The higher is your Agility - the higher are the bonuses you get from this stance.{vspace=5}Defensive stance is slightly less vulnerable to enemy feints.
{cps=50}Balanced stance is a compromise between the two, giving you no buffs or debuffs in attack or defense.{vspace=5}This stance however is way less vulnerable to enemy feints than either Offensive stance or Defensive stance.
{cps=50}On your way between Dartford and Greenwich, you run into a small group of roaming bandits.
{cps=50}Taking you for a knight, who is bound to have some good loot on him, they instantly attack you.
{cps=50}Having defeated the bandits, you make your way back to Dartford Castle.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}1 of 3 random encounters completed!

{cps=50}Yet another armed conflict between England and France scarcely qualified as a surprise to anyone. The two kingdoms were ardent rivals for more than a century now, and recurrent border clashes became a common thing. One might have mistaken this war for yet another small border clash, yet this time the King of England had other plans.{vspace=75}{color=#A9A9A9}Hold SPACEBAR to skip text.
{cps=50}Having dealt with several enemies, you win a small respite, allowing the peasants and the monks to take refuge in safety.
{cps=50}But for you there's nowhere to hide. And your battle has only just begun.
{cps=50}Slaying enemies one after another, you soon decimate their whole squad, defeating them completely.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 15!
{cps=50}Despite their numerical superiority, the enemies fail to get an upper hand. Suffering more and more losses and seeing no way to defeat you, they decide to retreat.
{cps=50}Wiping the blood off your blade, you get ready to head back.
{cps=50}But before you can hit the road, you find yourself surrounded by a small crowd of peasants and monks, showering you with praise for saving them, if not from death, then definitely from plunder.
{cps=50}As a reward, they offer you a handful of florins, that they pile up right there from their own pockets.
{cps=50}You happily accept the reward.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+50 Florins!
{cps=50}You, however, tell them to keep their money, saying that you will never accept gold from someone poorer than yourself. Which earns you even more respect in their eyes.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 6!
{cps=50}Your new friends also welcome you to visit the small fair that is regularly being held in Lindisfarne...
{cps=50}...where, according to them, one might find all sorts of useful stuff.
{cps=50}Your journey back to Dartford ends up being a rather uneventful one.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [sword_of_justice.name]!
{cps=50}Honestly, I'm not even surprised at this point. How the hell am I even supposed to compare you to my own knights after this?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 10!
{cps=50}It's really starting to look like the King took all the best toys with him to France to fight in his stupid war. And I was left here with is a bunch of near-useless dudes who can only ride horses and poke stuff with their sharp sticks.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Toys?
{cps=50}I mean, I'm always down for some riding and poking, if you know what I mean, but... But you really show that there's a lot more to being a knight than just that.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Did she just call me a toy?
{cps=50}You never once hesitated - no matter what task I gave you. Even if it meant fighting a real Goliath like the Sheriff was.
{cps=50}This is some admirable courage and determination.{w} And a bit of stupidity maybe.
{cps=50}Either way - I'm highly impressed.
{cps=50}I'm honoured by your praise, my lady. Except for the stupidity part.{w} That one hurt.
{cps=50}You're calling me 'my lady' now - how sweet!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 5!
{cps=50}So, how about we have ourselves a little bit of a celebration. I know we've got some urgent matters on our hands, but you obviously need rest.
{cps=50}What if we...say...{w}go for a...{w}picnic?
{cps=50}There are lots of lovely places around. Where we can... {w}you know...{w} chill{w} and stuff.
{cps=50}You, like I said, could really use some recreation. And honestly so could I.
{cps=50}I don't really go outside much these days, you see. For obvious reasons - safety and all.
{cps=50}I kind of miss just sitting in the sun, soaking in its radiant lights.
{cps=50}It's so bad that I even had my cook recompose my diet to add more Vitamin C - so I can supplement it in some way.
{cps=50}And also Vitamin D - but that's just because I don't have a boyfriend at the moment.
{cps=50}So.{w} What do you say?
{cps=50}I would love to.
{cps=50}Of course you would.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 5!
{cps=50}I'm sorry, my lady, but as you said - we do have some highly serious matters on our hands.
{cps=50}Bands of vicious thugs are still roaming your lands and the fate of the Kingdom itself is still in peril.
{cps=50}This is no time for fun.
{cps=50}Oh look at you - so focused and determined! So stoic. So hard to get.
{cps=50}Alright, alright. I'll play along, for now. But I will get my hands on you.
{cps=50}And boy oh boy...
{cps=50}So. With Sheriff out of the picture we now only have to deal with Duncan. And deal with him we will.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [robbin_the_hood.name]!
{cps=50}...and then I go like - why don't you come up to your wife's bedroom and say that to my face?
{cps=50}A-ha-ha-ha! Good one. That was definitely a good one.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}With a couple of wine jugs completely emptied, Alyssa, who is usually in total control of any situation she's in, seems to finally be letting her guard down.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Even if just for a little bit.
{cps=50}So. With Sheriff out of the picture we now only have to deal with Duncan - that self-proclaimed Prince of Thieves.
{cps=50}He calls himself the Prince of Thieves, eh?
{cps=50}But I doubt he's that good of a thief though.
{cps=50}And why is that?
{cps=50}Because he's running around stealing people's gold.
{cps=50}And I've only been around here for a week, but I already know that the only thing in Greenwich that is actually worth stealing is... your heart.
{cps=50}Oh wow. Do I seriously look that drunk?
{cps=50}I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
{cps=50}Relax, I'm just kidding.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 5!
{cps=50}I see what you did there though. Let's just say your application for the pussy-pass has been received and will be thoroughly evaluated in the upcoming days.
{cps=50}That's good enough for me.
{cps=50}Great.
{cps=50}You know, normally I'm more of a go-getter, as you might've figured.
{cps=50}Taking the long approach with all this courting and romantic bullshit and stuff - not really my cup of wine.
{cps=50}But with you I... I somehow enjoy this. I'm pretty sure that jumping straight to bed would be just as awesome but...
{cps=50}But I like taking it slow this time. Maybe because you're the first person in a very long while who can actually say something even remotely interesting.
{cps=50}Sometimes at least.
{cps=50}So yeah. I might be learning a thing or two about myself too these days. Here's that.
{cps=50}I might seem ignorant at times, I reckon. But it's not like I do it on purpose. At least not all of the time.
{cps=50}It's just... you know... I don't really have a lot of people to talk to.
{cps=50}People who will at least try to listen to what I'm saying instead of simply waiting for their turn to speak.
{cps=50}All while staring at my ass.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}......
{cps=50}Ha-ha. Don't panic. You can stare.
{cps=50}Just don't let it distract you from the job. I know my looks can kill - you don't have to become a proof of that. Another one.
{cps=50}So. Now we have to deal with Duncan. And deal with him we will.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [robbin_the_hood.name]!
{cps=50}The instructions received from Alyssa regarding the location of Duncan's supposed hideout point at a particular area in the Weald but are still somewhat vague. Which leaves you and your men wandering around the woods for quite some time.
{cps=50}After a while, however, you manage to track it down.
{cps=50}This success, in all honesty, is only made possible by the bandits themselves who gave their hideout away by doing a rather poor job of hiding.
{cps=50}Guided by the sounds of music and the sights of smoke rising from the chimneys of the shacks, you and your men arrive straight to their doorsteps.
{cps=50}This hideout, as it appears, has been in use for quite some time, remaining undetected despite all the efforts on the part of the Caldwells. Here, the bandits felt themselves as safe as ever.
{cps=50}Maybe even too safe for their own good: having their camp surrounded, your men swiftly take out the sentries and storm the hideout.
{cps=50}Catching the enemies completely by surprise, you win the battle before it really has a chance to begin.
{cps=50}Seeing that those few who try to fight are executed on sight, the majority of the bandits prefer to surrender. Among them you find Duncan.
{cps=50}Alyssa's men, who are under your command, have suffered a lot from Duncan and his friends in recent months, and now they are clearly eager to get some revenge.
{cps=50}Torturing him to death is hardly on their minds, as he is too big of a prize to lose just like that. But he definitely won't be in this good of a shape once they're done with him. They will make him pay an arm and a leg. Maybe even literally.
{cps=50}This little payback however is not something you intend to allow to happen.
{cps=50}Be it because of chivalry, morals or something else, you stop Alyssa's men from torturing Duncan.
{cps=50}They obviously aren't happy about it, but still follow your orders, paying respect to the chain of command.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 15!
{cps=50}While the men are preparing the captives and the loot for the journey home, you for a short while find yourself alone with Duncan, who thanks you for what you did.
{cps=50}This show of gratitude however is quickly followed by a smirk... With which he deems this act of virtue utterly meaningless as the duchess will not only execute him but put him through something much uglier than anything the soldiers might've come up with.
{cps=50}Two of his mates, for example, recently ended up being flayed and then burnt alive. By the personal orders of none other than the young lady Caldwell herself.
{cps=50}When you asked Duncan - whether he is afraid of sharing their fate? - he straight up laughs at you, offering you to do a quick thinking exercise.
{cps=50}He got his hands on enough gold to travel far away and live as king - and yet he is still here. Living in a mud hut, sleeping with his sword and regularly risking his own life in skirmishes against local lords.
{cps=50}Why would he live like this?{w} Why wouldn't he adorn himself in silk instead of a blood-soaked chainmail?{w} Why would he be the Prince of Thieves instead of becoming Duke of Sussex or Count of Kent?
{cps=50}And, most importantly, why he - a murderer and a thug according to some - is met with open arms in any peasant's house.{w} Why are men ready to risk their lives for him? And why do women name their sons after him?
{cps=50}Duncan laughs, seeing your confused expression.
{cps=50}'Tell me, sire knight, how does it feel to realise that you're fighting on the side of evil?'
{cps=50}When you have almost figured out what to answer, a soldier comes to inform you that everything is ready for the journey back.
{cps=50}The road back to Greenwich takes you through several villages, all the inhabitants of which, through word of mouth, are somehow already aware of what has happened.
{cps=50}And, when your convoy makes its way through the streets of another village, a good half of people come out to gaze at you and your prisoner.
{cps=50}Interestingly enough, instead of cheering for the capture of a notorious criminal, the peasants show nothing but sullen discontent.
{cps=50}And not only that. At some places the sight of Duncan in an iron cage invokes sobbing cries and insults. Insults directed at you and your squad.
{cps=50}And this is how you make your way to Greenwich.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [robbin_the_hood.name]!
{cps=50}Remembering Alyssa's words about drowning Duncan in his own blood, you see no reason to interfere and leave him alone with several of the countess's soldiers.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 15!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 15!
{cps=50}And of course, as one should expect in such cases, things go exactly the way they were least supposed to.
{cps=50}After spending some time preparing to transport the captured captives and loot back to Greenwich, you return to the hut where Duncan is being held.
{cps=50}Only to find him tortured to death.
{cps=50}You can't help but find yourself wondering whether such an end is a fitting one for the most notorious criminal in the south of the kingdom.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [robbin_the_hood.name]!
{cps=50}It doesn't take you much time though to find various signs of glimmering life that is actually quite active. In one of the least ruined parts of the abbey, you find monks, as well as a bunch of peasants all grouped around a large food cart.
{cps=50}As you head towards them, out of the corner of your eye you notice one more detail - this time both unsettling and unpleasant. To the north, in the distance, you clearly observe a large cloud of dust, slowly floating along the horizon.
{cps=50}The kind that is created not by wind but by riders. And judging by its size, there's quite a few.
{cps=50}Who they are and where are they heading is unclear, but right away something tells you that they are nothing but trouble.
{cps=50}The monks, however, look at you with suspicion and do not rush to do what you asked for. Instead they attack you with numerous questions about who you are and why did you come to Lindisfarne.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check failed!]
{cps=50}According to the monks, the area is full of bandits. Until recently they were mostly rebellious peasants, but recently there's been news of rogue knights joining their ranks. These days they target not only caravans or merchants but also monasteries and estates - which explains the distrust of the inhabitants of Lindisfarne towards strangers.
{cps=50}Realizing that there's no other way to get things off the ground, you show the monks the Royal Seal you received from the Prince. According to him, it was to be presented exclusively to the abbot - in order to convince him to hand over the sword to you.
{cps=50}In order to avoid drawing too much attention, the Prince recommended that you do not show it to strangers. However, seeing how the cloud of dust continues to steadily approach the abbey, you realize that you don't really have a choice.
{cps=50}The Seal, albeit not immediately, helps you convince the monks and soon you are taken to the abbot.
{cps=50}After listening to you while carefully studying the Seal, he initially responds to your request without much enthusiasm. But when you convey to him the Prince's promise to rebuild the abbey and restore it to its former glory, the abbot quickly changes his mind. Expressing his readiness to support the Prince, he agrees to hand over the sword to you.
{cps=50}Having recognized a worthy person in you, the monks take you to the abbot without further questioning.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Virtue check passed!]
{cps=50}Telling him in all the details about the purpose of your visit, you also show the abbot the Royal Seal received from the Prince.{vspace=5}According to the instructions, it was supposed to be presented exclusively to the abbot - in order to convince him to hand over the sword to you.
{cps=50}While one of the novices fetches it, he urges several monks to immediately begin praying for the success of your endeavor.
{cps=50}This ardent support instantly reinvigorates you both spiritually and physically.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!{vspace=5}Vitality increased by 1!
{cps=50}Having obtained the sword, you are ready to start your journey back - only to be stopped by the very thing you were afraid might happen.
{cps=50}A cloud of dust seen on the horizon materializes into a group of horsemen who rush into the abbey, weapons in hands.
{cps=50}Watching them from one of the buildings, you see how the uninvited guests, loud and violent, are searching for the abbot while greeting peasants and monks with kicks and punches.
{cps=50}Even without being Nostradamus, you are well aware that nothing good awaits Lindisfarne and its inhabitants. At least if you don't interfere.
{cps=50}The reasoning behind this risk, however, raises big questions...
{cps=50}However, in a fit of blind chivalry, you prefer to forget about the danger and rush to face the attackers.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 20!
{cps=50}Everyone knows that if you don't want to experience defeat, you should carefully pick your battles.
{cps=50}Prefectly understanding that you alone will hardly stand a chance against a large group of attackers, you make a logical decision to retreat.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 20!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Your arrival catches the earl and the prince in the middle of a conversation; mostly likely an important one - as both of them are keeping their voices down.
{cps=50}Relationships can be...
{cps=50}But they're also...
{cps=50}That's right.
{cps=50}You think I should talk to her?
{cps=50}You think I should talk to her.
{cps=50}All right. I'll talk to her.
{cps=50}But she'd better be paying me some proper respect this time.
{cps=50}I get the importance of the political marriages but I don't really have time for this taming of the shrew thing.
{cps=50}Hey, [name]. You're back.
{cps=50}I see you have the sword! Who would've thought it would be still there after all the years.
{cps=50}What do we do with it now?
{cps=50}Eh, you can hold on to it, I guess.
{cps=50}You are just on time.
{cps=50}This morning my men returned from the Sheriff's estate with all of his papers, letters and documents.
{cps=50}And, after spending half the day looking through them, I think we found a lead.
{cps=50}In Sheriff's correspondence with Duncan there are more than several mentions of a particular hideout in the Weald that is to be used 'in times of serious trouble'.
{cps=50}Description is somewhat vague but it may be sufficient nonetheless.
{cps=50}So, now we just have to go and get him. By 'we' I mean 'you', of course.
{cps=50}You and the boys.
{cps=50}I'd love to go too, but I've got dress-fitting planned in an hour. This time it's this fancy-looking one from Italy.
{cps=50}I've been dying to try it on for a while now actually.
{cps=50}Or take it off for you - if you're even luckier.
{cps=50}You, in the meantime, have to take care of Duncan. This peasant bastard has been a thorn in my side for far too long.
{cps=50}Find him and drown him in his own blood for me.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [robbin_the_hood.name]!
{cps=50}And here you are - victorious yet again.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Alyssa) improved by 30!
{cps=50}For something that will require a genuine effort on your part.
{cps=50}But then again - what if it's all just me?
{cps=50}There's not much use for even the toughest of brawns without some proper brains behind it.
{cps=50}Because in the end it is all about outsmarting your opponent and coming up with a clever plan.
{cps=50}Isn't that right, [name]?
{cps=50}Oh yeah. It's all about a plan. Trust me - I would know.
{cps=50}And yours were... Nothing short of genius to put it mildly.
{cps=50}Especially that part about challenging a master duelist to a fair single combat instead of just, you know, poisoning him or stabbing him in his sleep. Brilliant, honestly.
{cps=50}I have no idea how did you even come up with that shi... I mean stuff.
{cps=50}Frankly speaking, I would even go as far as to rank you as one of my top three planners of all time.
{cps=50}But you only get the third place though.
{cps=50}Because the other two are just... On another level, you know. They've got some galaxy brain stuff going over there.
{cps=50}As a matter of fact, I feel like I'm being played by them even right now. And somehow harder than I'm being played by you.
{cps=50}Hey what's with this disrespectful tone!?
{cps=50}Did you forget who your mistress is?
{cps=50}Uhm... That... came out a bit wrong.
{cps=50}Did it really?
{cps=50}It did. And it's obviously because of you.
{cps=50}Is it really?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}This is the first time you see Alyssa blush.{w} And this makes her look even more gorgeous.
{cps=50}Whatever. I guess all that matters is that we won this bloody war. And stuff.
{cps=50}You shouldn't say 'and stuff'.
{cps=50}You can't tell me what to do, you are not my father...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}She blushes even harder starting to look almost incandescent.
{cps=50}But I...{w} but I can call you daddy, I guess...
{cps=50}I mean if you want it... and stuff.{w} It's not like I'm into it or something... Don't get any wrong ideas.
{cps=50}Stupid.
{cps=50}I'm into anything you're into. My lady.
{cps=50}Oh God.{w}{vspace=5}... Just...{w}{vspace=5} Just take my damn clothes off already.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You have received Alyssa's gift.{vspace=5}Quest updated - [genius_idea.name]!
{cps=50}Alright. Now - off you go. I've got an afternoon gossip session with my girlfriends scheduled around this time.

{cps=50}Yet another armed conflict between England and France scarcely qualified as a surprise to anyone. The two kingdoms were ardent rivals for more than a century now, and recurrent border clashes became a common thing. One might have mistaken this war for yet another small border clash, yet this time the King of England had other plans.{vspace=75}{color=#A9A9A9}Press TAB to skip text.
{cps=50}As soon as you give him the promise to do that, he passes away.
{cps=50}{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [bad_news_travel_slowly.name]!
{cps=50}There are many more adventures ahead of you. Old friends and new enemies, deadly battles and femmes fatales, mystical prophecies and great feats.
{cps=50}But that is a whole other story.
{cps=50}And it will be told. In its due time.
{cps=50}With the help of comrades, you repel the attack of Dupont's knights and city guards, firmly holding the prison building.
{cps=50}Any and all illusions about a peaceful resolution that you might've had were shattering rapidly.
{cps=50}Even without advice from your comrades, it was now crystal clear to you that you must get out of the city as fast as possible.
{cps=50}The only question left hanging in the air was Olivia's fate. And there were two options.
{cps=50}All the stuff you found in her chambers was enough on its own to warrant an execution. And this was only the tip of the iceberg with something way more dark and sinister potentially hidden underneath. An evil conspiracy waiting to be uncovered.
{cps=50}But even despite all that you still could hardly bring yourself to forget how good she was to you. And how she never harmed you. What if it all is just some huge misunderstanding?
{cps=50}What if there is a perfectly logical explanation to all of this? One that leaves Olivia innocent. What if it's just a mistake?
{cps=50}You would've given a lot for an opportunity to sit down and calmly think everything through. But time was precious, and any delay could easily cost you and your men their lives.
{cps=50}But facts are facts. There's no running away from it. What you found is more than enough to carry out a death sentence - and God only knows how many more ugly secrets you might have discovered after a more thorough inspection.
{cps=50}This is how this world operates. Someone always has to do the dirty work, dipping their own hands up to the elbows in blood, for the sole purpose of others to condemn and blame them.
{cps=50}But doing so in peace and safety. In law and order. The ones that you have provided them with.
{cps=50}It all ends here - in a small prison cell.
{cps=50}Seeing everything perfectly in your eyes, Olivia does not even try to beg, ask, explain or intimidate.
{cps=50}Only once breaking silence to say eight words.
{cps=50}'We could have been so much more...{w} Together.'
{cps=50}When her severed head falls to the floor, you feel as if a part of your own self has died alongside her.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 30!
{cps=50}But this is no time for mourning.
{cps=50}Fate was clearly laughing at you. And even the dizzying madness of what was happening could not hide the irony of the whole situation.
{cps=50}To spend so much effort saving this damn city - only to now be turning your own sword against the very people you vowed to protect...
{cps=50}Feeling rather repulsed by the idea of extending the list of your noble deeds by adding to it an execution of a woman - you decide to simply leave Olivia behind. Almost like running from a bad dream.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 20!
{cps=50}Let her be somebody else's concern.
{cps=50}You would've loved to reflect on this decision, but time was running short.
{cps=50}Somewhere outside, Dupont was hastily raising the whole city to its feet, and the prison was about to be surrounded and turned into a death trap.
{cps=50}You had to leave now. But before you did, one of the soldiers wisely suggested that you should pay a quick visit to the prison's storage rooms...
{cps=50}Ruffin's men have turned their camp into a heavily fortified position. Located on top of the hill, it is soundly protected from heavy cavalry charges, preventing you from pulling off the same trick twice.
{cps=50}On the following days Dartford turns into a rallying point for various forces, arriving from all directions.
{cps=50}With the castle and its surroundings quickly running out of space to even accommodate this emerging army, the Prince soon moves everybody to Greenwich making it his new base of operations.
{cps=50}Alyssa, of course, also fulfilled her part of the deal, joining forces with the army and providing resources to sustain its presence.
{cps=50}On Saturday the Prince gathers all nobles for a large military council, where for the first time unveils the plan of the upcoming battle.
{cps=50}According to the intelligence, Canterbury successfully managed to not only turn the Parliament to his side but also make it pay for his military efforts.
This in return allowed him to quickly build a considerable force of mercenaries and men-at-arms, which he sent south to prevent your advance on London.
{cps=50}Wisely choosing his position, he located his troops in between two natural obstacles - a river on the left and the Weald on the right. Thus protecting himself from potential flanking.
{cps=50}According to the Prince, his general strategy is very easy. Occupy an already strong position with a numerically superior force - makes us think twice about attacking him. Make us hesitate and make us wait...
{cps=50}...and turn the whole thing into a war of attrition which we simply cannot win. Even bled dry of everything there is to eat and drink, Dartford and Greenwich won't be able to sustain the army for more than a month. Which means that waiting game is not really an option.
{cps=50}And the only way we can win - is by attacking.
{cps=50}The plan looks like this. The attack is to be launched at dawn; the main force, commanded by the Prince himself, will create an illusion of a frontal assault. But instead of actually attacking, they will just distract the enemies - showering them with arrows and bolts, and acting as if they are just about to charge.
{cps=50}Meanwhile, a detached cavalry force, led by the earl, will do the very thing that Canterbury considers impossible - outflank them across the Weald. Those woods are notoriously hard to navigate, but several local hunters agreed to serve as guides, promising to do the job.
{cps=50}This detachment, suddenly appearing where least expected, will sow chaos on Canterbury's positions.
{cps=50}The main force would then attack, crushing an already wavering enemy between themselves and the cavalry.
{cps=50}'And after that we dinner in London', - eventually concludes the Prince.
{cps=50}Having carefully listened to every detail of the plan, you find it solid. And yet you can't seem to get over the idea that something is not quite right. Something that you can't properly put into words.
{cps=50}It all begins rather well.
{cps=50}Following the plan, the main forces (and you among them) slowly approach enemies' positions and begin to let loose volleys of arrows and bolts.
{cps=50}The rebels return the favor.
{cps=50}This uneventful skirmish lasts for about an hour.
{cps=50}Remembering that, according to the plan, you are supposed to simulate preparation for an imminent attack, you ask the Prince how exactly this simulation thing should be done.
{cps=50}Puzzled for a moment, he tells you to put on an angry look and, from time to time, shout something intimidating at your opponents.
{cps=50}An hour later of skirmishing both sides completely deplete their ammunition.
{cps=50}Soon both sides completely deplete their ammunition, which brings the skirmish to an end. Meanwhile the earl and his men, who at this time were already supposed to be wreaking havoc behind enemy lines, are nowhere to be seen.
{cps=50}The whole thing was starting to look unsettling.
{cps=50}Another half an hour later, the situation finally started to change... However, it was Canterbury's forces that were making a move. A move towards your lines.
{cps=50}You firmly hold your ground in the center of the position, but the flanks - both left and right - are crumbling under the enemy's attack.
{cps=50}Having crushed the flanks of the Prince's forces, the Canterbury troops are swiftly engulfing you in a semicircle.
{cps=50}Wielding long spears and halberds, the rebel heavy infantry methodically crushes your entire formation into one chaotic and uncontrollable crowd...
{cps=50}You fight as hard as you can, but despite the effort, the battered and weary forces of the Prince continue to lose ground.
{cps=50}Every minute more and more of your allies fall dead or take flight.
{cps=50}The army is crumbling, and your complete defeat starts to look like only a matter of time.
{cps=50}In the chaos unfolding all around, you suddenly find yourself face to face with a well-equipped enemy knight, fighting under his own personal banner and shouting orders left and right.
{cps=50}Indetifying him as a priority target, you instantly charge him.
{cps=50}Killing the knight, you deal a considerable blow to enemy morale, slowing down their advance and earning a brief respite.
{cps=50}Breathing heavily, to prepare to gather all of your remaining strength for one last time. And at this very moment you finally see them. On top of the hill which is behind enemies' backs - a small heavy cavalry detachment... under the earl's personal banner.
{cps=50}Everything happens unbelievably quick. Trotting down the hill, the cavalry rearranges into an attacking wedge and switches to a gallop. Several enemy soldiers notice the upcoming threat, but it doesn't change a thing and the cavalry charges right into the back of the unsuspecting rebel infantry.
{cps=50}Skewered by heavy pikes and trampled by horses, the rebels instantly lose their desire to keep fighting.
{cps=50}They still have a considerable numerical superiority, but it's completely nullified by unfolding chaos and their shattering morale.
{cps=50}Seeing the rebels starting to flee in all possible directions, you can't understand which is more surprising to you: the fact that you seem to be winning a surely lost battle - or the fact that even after failing completely, the plan of the prince and the earl still somehow managed to work.
{cps=50}Well, it sure took you a while...
{cps=50}Wasn't the attack supposed to be a surprise?
{cps=50}Yeah. For them, not for us.
{cps=50}Honestly, you can blame it on those damn locals that we took as guides.
{cps=50}They were so bad I almost had to figure the road out myself.
{cps=50}By yourself? Wonder why you didn't end up at some local tavern then, huh...
{cps=50}Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Prince's sudden burst of laughter is almost infectious and you, still overwhelmed by the feeling of relief, can't help but start giggling as well.
{cps=50}That's very funny.
{cps=50}Hey! And what are you laughing at, [name]?
{cps=50}I knew from that start that fetching booze is pretty much a career ceiling for you.
{cps=50}He's also good at talking to girls. Can't ignore that.
{cps=50}Good at talking to girls my arse! What's hard about that? Anyone can do it.
{cps=50}Approach her, take a deep look in her eyes... My lady this, my lady that. A little bit of touching...
{cps=50}You say there's something shiny behind her ear - and all of a sudden you're making her virginity disappear.
{cps=50}I was knee deep in pussy when I was your age, [name]. Those were the days...
{cps=50}How long ago was that by the way? Like Ancient Rome times?
{cps=50}...not some farmers' daughters, [name]. I'm talking princesses and duchesses. Bet you've never even seen one up close, boy. Never even smelled one...
{cps=50}As a matter of fact, [name] might just have an opportunity to do that.
{cps=50}Earlier this week I received a letter from France. Princess Emma of Aquitaine is in hostilities with the French king. And is desperately searching for allies.
{cps=50}It looks like I might be getting a chance to correct my father's errors. And [name] might get to meet an actual princess.
{cps=50}Yeah, right. And all I'm getting is an opportunity to waste my senior years covered with dirt and blood with a sword in my hand.
{cps=50}Can't say I complain though. Peaceful life is just not for me.
{cps=50}Who are you trying to fool, old dog!? You just like spending time with your friends - and we with [name] here are the only ones you have.
{cps=50}It is kind of funny, sir.{w} May I please laugh too?
{cps=50}Try keeping your mouth shut, [name], if you want to at least resemble a noble person.
{cps=50}You, [name], deserve some serious reward by the way. The whole today's affair might've ended up rather poorly if it wasn't for you.
{cps=50}I'm in your debt. Which means the crown is in your debt.
{cps=50}And that debt shall be paid in full once we get to London.
{cps=50}Which should be in a couple of hours.
{cps=50}Yes, and once we're there - you, [name], are heading straight to the Royal Treasury and stuffing your pockets with as much gold as you can carry.
{cps=50}We've all been fighting for quite a while - I think it's time we all had a little rest. After I'm crowned as the King of England - consider you both officially on vacation.
{cps=50}Just remember not to spend all that gold in one day, [name].
{cps=50}Because, well, you know what they say...
{cps=50}Once the money goes...
{cps=50}So does the hoes.
{cps=50}She looks like she is in her late 20th, but despite her young age she seems very domineering, confidently giving orders left and right. And, even stranger, both peasants and mercenaries prefer to obey.
{cps=50}Just like that!? How about you take me on a date first or something...
{cps=50}There's this thing that I found... In your room.
{cps=50}What do you mean - 'found in my room'? Have you been going through my stuff!?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}What I did was scummy, and I will offer you my deepest apologies because of that. But only after you explain something to me.
{cps=50}The thing I'm talking about... is this dagger.
{cps=50}A dagger? This one? Are you sure it is mine?
{cps=50}I'm quite convinced that I have never owned such an item - I would've remembered. This thing probably belonged to Duke de Monfort.
{cps=50}There's a lot of his stuff all around here since, you know, - he used to own the place.
{cps=50}You're right, I guess. I acted like an idiot with all these stupid suspicions.
{cps=50}Well, what can I say...
{cps=50}You were not wrong about 'being an idiot' part. I hope this day will forever serve you as a reminder of how not to behave yourself around women. Or any decent people in general.
{cps=50}I had a way higher opinion of you, I won't lie. And now I am seriously disappointed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]{vspace=5}Relationship (Olivia) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}You did a lot - both for me and for Rennes. Which is why I will not punish you. Neither for invading my privacy nor for questioning my honor and faith with serious accusations.
{cps=50}Yet I will not lie to you by saying that this incident did not damage our relationship. It did. And you will have to do a lot to earn back my disposition.
{cps=50}Now go. I have no desire to speak to you anymore.
{cps=50}Do something that you're actually good at. Killing the rebels, for example.
{cps=50}I don't believe you.
{cps=50}Well. Even though you lack the courage to say it out loud, I can clearly see it in your eyes that you have some serious accusations to make.
{cps=50}Go ahead then. What will it be? Practicing the occult? Murder? Human sacrifices? Skipping church day?
{cps=50}I'm dying to hear what will YOU come up with.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Stepping forward, Olivia offers you both her arms.
{cps=50}Why are you silent now? Arrest me! Put me on trial! And if my blood is spilled, then it will be on your hands!
{cps=50}Forgive me my suspicions...
{cps=50}It was foolish of me. Foolish to both believe in some nonsense about you and then go through your stuff.
{cps=50}But when you reach for her belt - all of a sudden - she swiftly grabs an iron chandelier off the table and directs it straight at your head.
{cps=50}We could've been together, you know? When you came into my life, I felt something. Something real. It seemed to me that I am able to breathe again for the first time in years.
{cps=50}But for some stupid reason you felt a burning desire to go and ruin everything.
{cps=50}For the sake of the truth. I guess.
{cps=50}Justice too... Maybe.
{cps=50}Oh, so you're this kind of guy. For the sake of truth and justice, I see... Look at yourself! Listen to what you are saying! You're pathetic.
{cps=50}A father who was killed in the war, a mother tortured to death by bandits and a baby brother who starved to death.
{cps=50}What a nice reward for piety, isn't it?
{cps=50}Therefore, there is no need to tell me about justice, truth and God, for none of this exists. In this world, there is only your own WILL...
{cps=50}I was hoping that you would stand beside me, and I would finally not have to be alone anymore. But now I see who you really are...
{cps=50}You are just another step on my journey.{w} Goodbye. And thank you for your service to Rennes.
{cps=50}To the questions about why are you here and what awaits you, he responds with a crooked grin. And only walking away he answers - tomorrow morning you will be executed.
{cps=50}Realizing that there is nothing you can do now, you wait for a morning to come, secretly hoping for a miracle...
{cps=50}And a miracle happens: at night, the men from your squad break into the prison with swords in hands. They deal with the guards and immediately release you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Reputation (soldiers) check passed!]
{cps=50}However, the miracle does not happen and the next morning your head is cut off in a cramped courtyard in the back of the city prison.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Reputation (soldiers) check failed!]
{cps=50}A quick search through Olivia's room and personal belongings confirms your worst fears.
{cps=50}Occult treatises, strange items with cabbalic symbols, drawings with instructions on how to perform bizarre rituals and make human sacrifices.
{cps=50}The more you find, the colder it turns your blood.
{cps=50}Among all else, in one of the rooms you stumble across a hidden door. Behind it you find a dark completely unlit labyrinth of secret passages and turns going deep underground.
{cps=50}In the meantime, Olivia - tied and gagged - slowly regains consciousness, urging you to think about your next step.
{cps=50}You won't get through this on your own, that is for sure. But who is it that you want to send for?
{cps=50}Given the delicacy of the situation and a large number of explanations that you will obviously have to do, only two options come to mind.
{{cps=50}There are either your own men - ex-soldiers from the King's army whom you've come to Rennes with. They are reliable guys who trust you and most likely will believe in whatever crazy story you will tell them.
{cps=50}Maybe even as crazy as this one.
{cps=50}Or, on the other hand, there's Dupont, commander of the city guard. Though you didn't like him that much originally, surviving and winning two battles side by side elevated your opinion of him.
{cps=50}He could be trusted. And, what is even more important, his involvement could make sure that there will be no hostilities between the city guards and your men - outsiders that dared to arrest the Duchess.
{cps=50}Perfectly understanding that any rash step could easily turn the whole city upside down, you send for the man who, as you believe, can help you keep the balance - Dupont.
{cps=50}He takes excruciatingly long to arrive. During this time, Olivia makes several attempts to talk to you, but the gag in her mouth prevents you from understanding even a word she says.
{cps=50}When Dupont eventually gets here, you instantly start realizing that the choice was right. He carefully listens to you, looks through the horrible items that you've found and then confirms that you made the right call.
{cps=50}He adds that he had his own suspicions about Olivia, but didn't want to rush things - especially at this time.
{cps=50}After making sure that he knows everything you know, Dupont gives you a nod and calls in his guards...{w} Whom he then tells to arrest you on charges of treason and an attempt of killing the Duchess.
{cps=50}What the hell did you think was going happen?
{cps=50}I'm not proud of it, no. However, it is what it is. And before you crossed me, you should have carefully thought about what exactly you are getting yourself into.
{cps=50}I've told you many times, haven't I? This is my city. Mine. So is everything and everyone inside of it.
{cps=50}Be serious with me. Did you honestly think that my own commander of the guard, the man who holds that position because of me and who is filthy rich because of me, would arrest me!? ME!
{cps=50}Unlike you, [name], Dupont is smart. He won't bite the hand that feeds him.
{cps=50}Today you want to arrest me because of couple o' books and inverted crosses. And tomorrow you might just as well be coming for him because of a handful of Florins missing from the treasury. Nobody likes saints.
{cps=50}I am very disappointed, [name].
{cps=50}And I don't even know what saddens me more - your narrow-minded morality or deficient mental abilities.
{cps=50}Although, come to think of it, one may just as well be a consequence of the other.
{cps=50}Oh, what hopes I had...
{cps=50}Although the mind tells you that you need to send for Dupont, you decide to go with your heart on this one. And the heart says that in such a situation you can only rely on those in whom you have zero doubt.
{cps=50}You send a servant to get your men and, as soon as they arrive, immediately arrest the duchess, locking her in a dungeon under the watchful eyes of your comrades.
{cps=50}This obviously does not go unnoticed, and the word of what is happening quickly gets to Dupont; who immediately rushes to confront you with a dozen of soldiers.
{cps=50}Trying to turn him to your side and making him see the truth, you show Dupont some of the horrible things you found in the duchess's chambers.
{cps=50}After carefully examining the evidence, Dupont promises to take care of this, but only after you hand Olivia over to him and tell your men to stand down.
{cps=50}At the same time, the commander of the guard guarantees safety to all of you and also promises that he will place Olivia under house arrest until everything is figured out.
{cps=50}The terms are far from ideal, but even without being a genius, you clearly realize that the alternate option is a much more grim one.
{cps=50}A full-fledged war on the streets of the city, between those who until recently defended its walls shoulder to shoulder.
{cps=50}Not wanting to drown Rennes in the blood of its own people, you agree...
{cps=50}Only to be chained and thrown into a prison cell a few moments later - completely trading places with Olivia who is released.
{cps=50}You tell Dupont that you cannot accept his terms.
{cps=50}Standing face to face, you both want to avert bloodshed and desperately search for a way to compromise with each other. However, none of you is willing to back down a step.
{cps=50}And, therefore, things turn out exactly as they do in this kind of situations.
{cps=50}And Dupont sends his men forward.
{cps=50}I get the importance of the political marriages, but there really should be some easier options than her.
{cps=50}With all the tantrums and shenanigans that she's put me through I almost feel qualified to write a book on this whole taming of the shrew thing.
{cps=50}Maybe you should.
{cps=50}Maybe I will.
{cps=50}And I see you have the sword! Who would've thought it would be still there after all the years.
{cps=50}It was there. But I wasn't the only one after it.
{cps=50}The abbey was raided by someone... Canterbury's men, I suppose. Too well-equipped for some local highwaymen.
{cps=50}Hm, it looks like the bastard had the same idea we did.{w} Good thing we're always one step ahead.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Prince shrugs with a smirk, demonstrating that there is nothing to be surprised at.
{cps=50}Superior planning.
{cps=50}And military genius.
{cps=50}Haven't you guys just lost a war? And aren't we on the verge of being outplayed by a murderous traitor who is about to steal the crown?
{cps=50}You said something, [name]? I didn't quite catch that.
{cps=50}So this is how we're going to play it... Alright.{vspace=5}No, sir, I didn't.
{cps=50}There rarely is a point to asking questions like - 'how well exactly are you doing?'.
{cps=50}You're either doing...
{cps=50}...or you're not.
{cps=50}Definitely sounds like something a crown prince would say.
{cps=50}So, what do we do with the sword?
{cps=50}The sword?{w} Ah, the sword!
{cps=50}Eh, you can hold on to it for now, I guess.
{cps=50}It's time will come.
{cps=50}Just tell me that you've got it all under control. And that there's nothing to worry about.
{cps=50}It's all under control, Olivia. There's not a thing to worry about.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 5!
{cps=50}It's all done. Alyssa will convince her father to support our cause.
{cps=50}And now that the bandits are completely gone, we can fully count on all the resources the Caldwells have. Which is quite a lot.
{cps=50}That's good news. And very timely, I must say.
{cps=50}We almost started to think that sending you to the countess was a mistake. But it looks like you did the job.
{cps=50}I did. And maybe it's time you finally stopped doubting me.
{cps=50}Ha! Stopped doubting you!? If I had even an ounce of doubt in you, boy, we would've left you back in France.
{cps=50}I'll be damned if you're not one of the best soldiers in the whole damn army!
{cps=50}The earl is right.
{cps=50}You have proven more than once that you can be counted on. Such things I don’t forget.
{cps=50}On Monday we march on London, and by evening I will be either king or dead.
{cps=50}If all ends well, then the reward won't disappoint you.
{cps=50}And if not... Then this is my fate.
{cps=50}Go and prepare, [name]. The next several days will not be easy.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Added new quest - [kingmaker.name]!
{size=+10}[consumables_container.fancy_name!t]{/size}
{cps=50}After the capture of the city, most of the lords and commanders of various detachments of the royal army rushed to seize all the most prominent and wealthy buildings in the city, making them their makeshift residences.

{cps=50}Ha! This doofus is impressed by anything that has the word 'royal' in it. That's just his yokel nature - you can take a man out of the countryside but not the countryside out of a man.

{cps=50}So yeah... And, by the way, you can also pay a visit to the Greenwich armory - I'll tell my people to let you in. It's not the Tower, of course, but there might be something useful.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Добавлен новый квест - [mortal_combat.name]!

{cps=50}Despite extreme fatigue and exhaustion, you are still able to reason soberly enough to understand that at this very moment the fate of the whole assault may be determined.
{cps=50}The French, just like you, are fighting with their last bit of strength. The death of the knight leading their defense is simply bound to make them quail.

{cps=50}Your courage, however, clearly does not go unnoticed and this act of bravery significantly increases the respect of your fellow soldiers, many of whom you saved  today.
{cps=50}Realizing that things are about to go down and is not at all about your courage now, you lead the flight and leave the wall among the first.

{cps=50}The sergeant have witnessed your act of bravery and on the way back to the camp,  promises to put in a good word for you with Earl, who promised a reward to all who show courage during the assault.
{cps=50}Forgive me if my question comes off tactless to you, but can you please share some of your recipes?
{cps=50}I'm not sure I understand what you're talking about ...
{cps=50}I meant recipes for medicine and various potions.
{cps=50}But why would you need it? Do you not trust my skills?
{cps=50}It's quite opposite. I completely trust your skills. However, every drop of blood counts on the battlefield and I just want to be sure that in case of injury I can provide myself with first aid...
{cps=50}...so I would be able to live a little longer and get to you.
{cps=50}I see. Yes, you are probably right. Many deaths could have been avoided if the soldiers knew even the basics of field medicine.

{cps=50}On the way back to the camp, the sergeant, who has witnessed your act of bravery, promises to put in a good word for you with Earl, who offered a reward to anyone who would show courage during the assault.
{cps=50}Anna's assignment leads you to a large forest east of Rennes. According to the map she gave you, the old chapel should be located right in its center.
{cps=50}However, despite receiving relatively precise instructions, you are able to find it only after thoroughly wandering through the forest thicket.
{cps=50}You keep your eyes peeled while searching, expecting to clash with the bandits that Anna warned you about.{w} But you never meet anyone.
{cps=50}Moreover, the wilderness you found yourself into, does not even look like the place bandits would be in anyway. But despite that, the deeper you wander into the thicket, the more difficult it is for you to brush off the strange uneasyness you feel.
{cps=50}When you finally get to your destination, you see a deteriorating and dilapidated stone chapel, in which the remains of a once grand structure are guessed.
{cps=50}The stone walls overgrown with moss seem to come not even from a few centuries ago, but most definitely from the antiquity. The time when myths and legends came to life.
{cps=50}The uneasy feeling that haunted you all the way here reaches its peak.
{cps=50}But even though you sense that nothing good will come out of it, you put your premonitions aside and confidently step inside the chapel.
{cps=50}Inside the chapel is twilight. Waiting for your eyes to get used to the darkness, you stand at the entrance for a while, looking around.
{cps=50}Contrary to your worries, there seem to be no unpleasant surprises inside.
{cps=50}The decaying pieces of furniture, fragments of the roof and walls laying on the floor, dilapidated stone bas-reliefs and a massive altar - everything that one might expect to find inside the old chapel.
{cps=50}The only detail that catches your eye is the strange statue overlooking the altar.
{cps=50}You cannot make out its details. The statue, wrapped in twilight, is covered with moss and entangled with branches and vines, which make the silhouette unrecognizable.
{cps=50}Building up your courage, you take the first step...{w} and immediately hear a metallic clang under your feet.
{cps=50}Turns out that the floor of the chapel is littered with all sorts of fragments of armor and equipment - as if a full-fledged battle with a dozen or even more participants was unfolding here.
{cps=50}When you take a closer look, you begin to make out dried out and faded bloodstains on the stones of the floor and walls.
{cps=50}Stepping carefully, you approach the altar, on which, to your surprise, you find a small medallion, which matches the description given by Anna.
{cps=50}But as soon as you reach out to take it, the chapel is filled with a sharp grinding of metal.
{cps=50}Jumping back, you forced to admit that it is exactly what you expected, but what you least wanted.
{cps=50}The statue towering over the altar, that was until recently completely still, now is rapidly coming alive.{w} Shaking off stones, leaves and branches, it got off from its pedestal and took a few steps towards you, catching rare rays of sunlight breaking through the crumbling roof.
{cps=50}A giant knight in rusted and half-rotted armor, casing him from head to toe is standing right before your eyes. Knights face is completely covered by shut visor of his helmet...{w} From under slits of which only a black void is gaping.
{cps=50}And in his hands rests a weighty two-handed ax that looks more like an executioner's weapon.
{cps=50}Everything suddenly makes sense to you. This living statue was like a missing piece of puzzle and now you can clearly see the whole picture.
{cps=50}If it was really about the bandits, then Anna would have simply send the mercenaries who were running errands for her to get the medallion.
{cps=50}And since this did not happen, it means that the matter here is somewhat more dangerous than bandits. Something that the mercenaries did not want to get involved in, even despite Anna's orders...
{cps=50}With this conclusion, you decide to take the most logical step possible - to turn back before it's too late.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A huge forged chest full of all sorts of stuff, most of which is useless.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Among other things, however, it also contains a capacious marching bag made of good leather, probably belonging to the Sheriff himself.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}It is filled to the brim with all kinds of medicine and potions.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As you continue to look through the bottles, you notice that the cork on one of them is a little bit loose.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}That reminded you about a small vial of poison, which rests in one of your pockets.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The solution suggests itself. But would it be right? After all, the Sheriff's guilt and his complicity in the affairs of the bandits are far from being proven to be true...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 15!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Alcohol is poisoned!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You would rather play by the rules.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}In the end, suspicions about the Sheriff can easily turn out to be unfounded, and he may well turn out to be a valuable ally in the future.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by [attackchance]!
{cps=50}Even when the severed head of the Warden falls to the ground, and his armored body drops on the floor with a deafening clang, you cannot shake off the feeling that he is about to rise again.
{cps=50}It's only after quite a few minutes of strenuous waiting you are able to convince yourself that he is really dead.
{cps=50}The Warden's equipment becomes your reward.
{cps=50}The fight is dragging on. It may be wise to retreat while you still can.
Feeling that you cannot handle the Warden, you flee.
{cps=50}After you have dealt with the mysterious Warden and obtained the medallion, you hastily leave the chapel and turn back.
{cps=50}The thing is that... That...
{cps=50}The map you gave me turned out to be slightly off.
{cps=50}Yes, that's right. I have spent half a day in search, looked under every bush in half of the forest, but I never found the chapel you mentioned...
{cps=50}What happened to all those who came before?
{cps=50}Tested?
{cps=50}I tried to save him.
{cps=50}He was not my friend.
{cps=50}I was under orders.
{cps=50}You've destroyed families. Left daughters mourning their fathers.
{cps=50}I fought in a war. I had to spill blood.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Kneeling down in front of you, the knight bowes his head, exposing it to your blow.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You raise weapon and, aiming at a small gap between the helmet and the armor, you bring it down with all of your strength.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A powerful strike shakes the knight and for a moment it seems to you that his head is about to fall and roll on the floor.{vspace=5}[[Coordination - success!]
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}However, the knight, as if nothing had happened, gets up and adjusts his grip on the ax handle.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Due to the twilight and your anxiousness, the blow turns out to be unimpressive, its impact going completely into the armor.{vspace=5}[[Coordination - fail!]
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Making it clear that this is where his generosity ends, the knight gets up and adjusts his grip on the ax handle...
{cps=50}Standing before de Roche, lying in oblivion, you do not at all feel enthusiastic for this mission.
{cps=50}You are a soldier, not a murderer, and the very thought of cutting the throat of a helpless person truly disgusts you.
{cps=50}Standing before de Roche, lying in oblivion, you suddenly catch yourself thinking that you do not feel anything about what you about to do.
{cps=50}Even though just a few months ago, you would be disgusted by the sheer thought of cutting the throat of a helpless person.
{cps=50}However, war changes people.
{cps=50}Your father used to say that often, but only now, holding a dagger to the throat of senseless a person, did you understand what he meant.
{cps=50}You slit de Roche's throat and leave his lifeless body behind, hurrying back to your comrades.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 50!
{cps=50}Knowing full well that you will definitely regret it, you lower your weapon and step back.
{cps=50}{cps=50}The news of your failed mission causes great discontent. The earl makes it clear to you that by failing the same highly demanding assignment twice, you have severely undermined his confidence in you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 20!
{cps=50}...there is an ugly underside. With poisons, cloaks and daggers. With dastardly murders, unworthy deeds and backstabbing.
{cps=50}The news of your successful mission are celebrated first by Earl and the Prince, and then throughout the whole English camp.
{cps=50}There is no time to continue the search, and all that left for you is to get back as fast as you can.
{cps=50}The Prince does not exert severe criticism, but points out that the night diversion to distract the French has cost Brittish army about hundred brave warriors who did not come back.
{cps=50}More horrible though is that the failure of this gambit further confirms French army's upmanship. The only recourse is for Edward to negotiate peace.
{cps=50}Ha, well, you don't have a lot of options, if you have ended up in a war bare-assed.
{cps=50}Take a look around the camp - someone might have a spare gambeson, chainmail or shield lying around.
{cps=50}Most soldiers would happy to sell off their loose junk or trade a war booty for a shiny coin. But to find something useful is mostly a matter of luck, you know.
{cps=50}Well, the second option is, of course, to loot it yourself. Searching off corpses like a vulture, of course, not the most pious thing, but sometimes if you want to live, you have suck it up.
{cps=50}If you prove that you are a decent lad, then so be it, I'll see what I can do.
{cps=50}You've proven yourself. I need men like you and preferably in one piece.
{cps=50}If you ever need to get ahold of something specific from the equipment - come to me and I will see what can be done.
{cps=50}I think I don't need to explain that it won't be for free. But don't worry - I will not rip you off either.
{cps=50}Sure we'd work something out.
{cps=50}My men got something for you. Here.
{cps=50}I remember your request. No news yet - come back later.
{cps=50}Short sword, you say? Hah! I thought better of you, son.
{cps=50}Okay, okay, I'll see what I can get my hands on.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You lost [trait] Florins!
{cps=50}Come back after a short while.
{cps=50}Long sword, you say? And a good one? Aren't you being a little bit too ambitious?
{cps=50}Perhaps your highness would like a war horse, a castle and a princess as well?
{cps=50}Okay, so be it, I'll see what I can do.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You lost [trait] Florins!
{cps=50}One-handed ax, you say? Good choice.
{cps=50}I'll see what I can get my hands on.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You lost [trait] Florins!
A two-handed ax, you say? Good choice.
{cps=50}The spear, you say, and a long one too?
{cps=50}So that your pampered ass could reach from your tent to stab a frenchie?
{cps=50}Aren't you being a little bit too ambitious?
{cps=50}A mace, you say? But just not too heavy?
{cps=50}Even if you meet a knight head to toe in armor, you can always smack him in the head!
{cps=50}I respect such a choice.
{cps=50}Come back to me after a short while - I'll see what I can get.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You lost [trait] Florins!
{cps=50}A shield, you say? Alright, I'll see what I can get my hands on.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You lost [trait] Florins!
{cps=50}A helmet, you say? Alright, I'll see what I can get my hands on.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You lost [trait] Florins!
{cps=50}An armor, you say? Alright, I'll see what I can find.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You lost [trait] Florins!
{cps=50}A crossbow, eh? Alright, I'll see what I can get my hands on.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You lost [trait] Florins!
{cps=50}I don't have time to fuss with every soldier, boy.
{cps=50}As I already said, if you want to be noticed - show yourself and prove that you are worth something.
{cps=50}Until then, piss off and don't waste my time.
{cps=50}Why are you so worried about his fate now? It was you who ratted him out in the first place, wasn't it!?
{cps=50}There is no need to beat yourself up because of it though - you did the right thing... Probably...
{cps=50}Falling-out with the allies over a small gang of thieves is the last thing we need right now. Although, if we look at it from a moral side of things, then what you did is of course, highly dabatable...
{cps=50}Either way, it really doesn't matter for two of them anymore. But the third one...
{cps=50}However, they say that the valiant guards have beat him to a pulp on the first day... Won't be surprised if poor lad has kicked the bucket already, ha-ha
{cps=50}Ha... Although there is clearly no laughing matter... God rest his soul.
{cps=50}Earl loaded me with another errand of his...
{cps=50}Yeah, it won't be easy.{w}But we are not strangers, so I will help you.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation check passed!
{cps=50}Yeah, it's not an easy task.{w} But you have proven yourself well and people respect you.
{cps=50}And therefore, so be it - I will help you.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation check passed!
{cps=50}Yeah, it's not an easy task.{w} And, given your reputation, there won't be a line of those who could help you out.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation check failed!
{cps=50}But so be it. I'll help you, but you owe me a bottle of good wine then.
{cps=50}How's the search going?
{cps=50}Fine, i'll take it. In theory, Hoggard shouldn't get a dirt nap from such a small portion of poison anyway, but it would't hurt to play it safe.{w} Especially since he is, damn him, the earl's relative...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}Take these canteens. I have a bag for you, if you can't carry them in your hands - you can fit everything in it.

{cps=50}Sitting by the fire in the company of other soldiers, you decide to give the lute a try and strum something.
{cps=50}You have never played any musical instruments before, so you hope to master the lute along the way.
{cps=50}However, something is not right.
{cps=50}Either the lute is completely out of tune, or your fingers are too crooked, thick, and slow, because instead of a pleasant melody, you are only able to play some kind of infernal cacophony that aggravates everyone around the fire.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Coordination check failed!

{cps=50}I'd rather take the gambeson. Thanks anyway.
{cps=50}About the ingredients...
{cps=50}For a sleeping aid.
{cps=50}For the one you talked about. For the warehouse.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item handed over!
{cps=50}Without a hitch, you say?
{cps=50}Let me guess... Everything is covered, but there is one 'but'?

{cps=50}What can I say ...
{cps=50}The deal is suspicious, the prospects are vague.{w} I'm in.
{cps=50}It's an interesting proposal, but I think I'll pass.

{cps=50}You shoot and miss.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Crossbow skill check failed!
{cps=50}While collecting all kinds of herbs in the forest, you suddenly notice a venomous snake lying on a large stone.
{cps=50}Exploring the surroundings of Cambrai, you wander into a small grove to the west of the city, where, on one of the narrow paths, you literally bump faces with a French soldier.
{cps=50}You immediately draw your weapon, but the Frenchman not only does not respond in kind but, on the contrary, signals you in every possible way that he has no intentions to fight.
{cps=50}Taking a closer look at him, you notice that this goon does not pose a big threat: he is so puny, that his equipment hangs on him like a sack on a stick.
{cps=50}According to the Frenchman, he passed through Cambrai on the way to one of the neighboring villages.
{cps=50}But, after the start of the siege, the city authorities indiscriminately dragged everyone who was able to hold weapons into the city militia. And he, among many others, was drafted too.
{cps=50}However, not wanting to fight, he hastened to desert at the first opportunity and now is heading home.
{cps=50}Noticing the appraising look with which you inspect his equipment, the Frenchman unexpectedly offers you to buy anything you like from him, as he does not plan to fight, but an extra couple of florins would definitely come in handy...
{cps=50}Thanks to the quality shoes, you are able to move at a high pace and soon safely get out of the woods.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Trinket check passed!
{cps=50}However, this does not help, as ten minutes later a small pack of aggressive wolves appears near you, and their intentions are clear.
{cps=50}Luckily for you, the sounds of a struggle catch the attention of a small detachment of English soldiers patrolling the area.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (Sergeant) check passed!

{cps=50}Great job. I have no idea what you were doing in the forest, but the fact that you found this bastard is wonderful.
{cps=50}There are always a lot of deserters during any campaign... Usually, these rats run away light, but this scoundrel took a whole set of excellent equipment with him!
{cps=50}I think he'll be very happy to see us again.{w} And especially the torture master.
{cps=50}I've already seen him at work a couple of times, and the guy clearly knows his craft. I would even say that he is too good. After a couple of hours with him, people begin to confess to anything and everything...
{cps=50}And this is for you. Well deserved.

{cps=50}This is very funny.
{cps=50}Alright. So who is she?
{cps=50}Shouldn't that count you out by default?
{cps=50}I'm not sure I quite follow you.
{cps=50}Sorry to disappoint, but I'm neither a tailor nor a fashioner...
{cps=50}H-m-m... Sounds doable, I guess.
{cps=50}On the way back, the clouds over your head rapidly cover the sky, and heavy rain begins.
{cps=50}Not wanting to get soaked, you look for a shelter and stumble upon a hunting hut in the woods.
{cps=50}Most likely made as a temporary shelter in case of bad weather or something like that.
{cps=50}As it rains for a long time, you waste a lot of time waiting...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time until next event: -2

{cps=50}Moving through the thicket, you wander into a small clearing. There you find a makeshift hut made of branches, which looks like it was set up in haste and quite recently.
{cps=50}A brief glance at the dwelling reveals traces of a bonfire, as well as food scraps - apple cores, gnawed animal bones, and a couple of empty bottles of ale.
{cps=50}But before you even try to guess who lives here, the owner of the dwelling himself appears.
{cps=50}An untidy-looking armed man with a bundle of brushwood emerges on the opposite side of the clearing. His clothes, smeared with mud, are torn and frayed by tree branches. However, some of the heraldic symbols on them are still visible... and they seem suspiciously familiar to you.
{cps=50}You are willing to swear that you are looking at a deserter.
{cps=50}Upon seeing you, the stranger immediately draws his weapon and rushes in your direction.
{cps=50}Not wanting to shed blood in vain, you try to reason with the deserter and convince him that you do not pose a threat to him.
{cps=50}He, however, only laughs at your words. Noting that you definitely do not pose a threat to him, because you do not even have your armor on. And therefore, it will be much simpler for him to dispose of you than to risk leaving you alive.
{cps=50}Your words make him think. By the facial expressions and demeanor of the deserter, you sense that he is in a desperate situation, and letting you go will put him in no less jeopardy than if he were to face you in combat.
{cps=50}After a little hesitation, he nevertheless agrees to confide in you, making you give him your word that you won't give out his whereabouts to anyone.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check passed!
{cps=50}He contemplates your words for a second... However, he quickly casts his doubts aside, stating that he cannot trust you, and you will certainly snitch on him.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check failed!
{cps=50}The way back is uneventful at first.{w} However, with each new step, it becomes more difficult for you to shake off the feeling that someone is watching you.
{cps=50}Several very suspicious fellas suddenly block your way.
{cps=50}At first you mistake them for ordinary robbers, but quickly realize that something is very wrong with them.
{cps=50}As if in confirmation of these thoughts, strangers, without even voicing their demands, draw their weapons...

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tutorial: Armor{vspace=5} Your character has 5 different armor slots that allow you to wear 5 different armor pieces at the same time.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}First of all there is a body armor slot for various big armor pieces — gambesons, chainmails, plates, etc. Body armor usually offers the biggest amount of protection and sometimes can cover not only your torso but also your limbs and neck. It also, however, can apply a lot of penalties to your attributes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Second big one is the helmet slot — for various helmets and head protection items. In battle, the head is harder to hit than the torso, but the blows, received to the head, do more damage and can inflict particularly nasty injuries. So it would be wise to keep your head safe.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}There are also three additional armor slots: gorget slot (for items that protect neck and throat), bracer slot, and leg armor slot (both for items that protect limbs).{vspace=5}Neck is very hard to hit, but strikes to the neck do the most damage and sometimes can cut the throat causing massive bleedings.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Limbs, on the other hand, have the lowest damage modifier out of all body zones, but every successful strike to the limbs builds up the fatigue. On top of that, injuries to arms and legs greatly diminish your weapon skill and agility which are responsible for your attack and defense. Thus, even though the limbs seem like the least vital body part, they definitely are not the least important.
{cps=50}The effectiveness of repairing a mechanical drum depends on your Craftsmanship skill. Each repair attempt will consume some of your time.{vspace=5}It is only possible to conduct repairs while in camp.
{cps=50}Being the youngest son of an impoverished merchant, you never had any particular ambitions about your future. And never in your wildest dreams had you imagined yourself becoming a warrior.
{cps=50}Living a poor but steady life you, from a young age, found solace in hard and honest physical labour. Never asking for much, you were happy to spend your days working and evenings partying with friends at a local tavern — letting wine and ale wash away the sweat.
{cps=50}It was one of these evenings that turned your whole world upside down.
{cps=50}Drunken brawls at the tavern were not uncommon — especially when the place was visited by some fancy-dressed outsiders with fat purses and bad manners. The locals didn't take kindly to this kind of strangers.
{cps=50}That night it was the Sheriff's youngest son with his buddies who showed up at the tavern. Loud, haughty and full of his usual obnoxious swagger, he immidiately started to boast about how he and his family own all of Greenwich; telling stories about riches of his father and countless men killed by his older brother — a bloodthirsty duelist.
{cps=50}They were almost openly asking for an ass-whooping. This time, however, it didn't end with a simple fistfight. Things escalated and soon after first hands were thrown people started reaching for clubs and knives.
{cps=50}You reached for yours too.{w}{vspace=5}It was not really clear who had landed the blow that killed the Sheriff's son. But it were you who had to pay for it.
{cps=50}A couple of hours later that same night armed people dragged you out of your own house, throwing you into Greenwich jail. The Sheriff paid you a personal visit and — after a rather brief half-hour beating — promised you that you'd be hanged by the next noon.
{cps=50}At dawn, using the carelessness of the sleepy guards who were taking you to see the judge, you escaped.
{cps=50}A day later — hungry and dirty — you arrived in London. With no idea where to go, you came across a wagon of royal recruiters, agitating local beggars and drunkards to join militia of the king's army that was about to set out north — to wage war against the invading Scots.
{cps=50}Finding yourself in the middle of a strange city with no friends or money but with a hefty bounty on your head, you didn't really had much of a choice.{w} If you had to lose your life — you'd rather die by a sword or an arrow than from a shameful noose around the neck.
{cps=50}A couple of hours later you entered a large military encampment on the northern end of the city.
{cps=50}Ruffin was right and precisely one week after you appeared in the camp the army set out north.
{cps=50}The days of waiting and constant nervous excitement were finally over and, for the first time in a very long while, you caught yourself actually being hopeful about the future.
{cps=50}Yes, the fate did drag you through the mud and, yes, you did end up going to a war. But whatever battles and perils lay ahead — you'd rather take your chances surviving them, than a hangman's noose.
{cps=50}And if this whole campaign somehow ends up being a success, then you might return back not only alive but even a wealthy man. And even if you can't come back home — the money surely will help you settle down somewhere else.
{cps=50}With these optimisctic thoughts running through your head you marched forward.
{cps=50}After two month of grueling travel the king's army finally made it to outskirts of York — a northern stronghold of the kingdom.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance — success!{vspace=5}You took the march well.
{cps=50}After two month of grueling travel the king's army finally made it to outskirts of York — a northern stronghold of the kingdom.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance — fail!{vspace=5}Fatigue +15!
{cps=50}Eventhough the common militiamen like you were not made aware of the battleplans, various rumours and talks painted a very clear picture of the city of York playing a crucial role in defense of the northern lands of the kingdom.
{cps=50}However up until this point there was no precise information about what's going on inside the city. And noone could even say for sure if it was still loyal to the crown or has already been captured by the Scots.
{cps=50}Seeking to avoid unnecessary risk, the command decided to send out a small party of militiamen to the city suburbs to conduct a field reconnaissance.
{cps=50}You happened to be one of those chosen for the task.
{cps=50}After observing the area from atop of nearby hill and not seeing any enemy forces, your party enters the city's suburbs where you immediately run into an unpleasant surprise...
{cps=50}There indeed are no Scots around, but the place is overrun with a large group of marauders pillaging and then setting aflame houses on this side of the city walls.
{cps=50}Seeing the modest size of your party they immediately attack...
{cps=50}You turn back to see a warrior with large bow. At first glance he seems to be a total stranger but after a couple of seconds you recognize him as one of the Welsh archers that were arguing with the mercenary crossbowman back at the camp.
{cps=50}After making sure he hit the enemy, the archer hastily switches to another target, leaving you to your own devices.
{cps=50}Marauders fight with ferocity but slowly they begin to crumble.
{cps=50}Very soon all of the poorly armed ones are either killed or forced to flee and the only ones left fighting are the experienced and well-equipped brigands.
{cps=50}You receive a respite... And an understanding of the fact that you have made it out alive of your first battle.
{cps=50}Even managing to kill someone.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}A brief pause in battle gives you a chance to search the bodies of the killed enemies. Or use this time to rest and do away some of the fatigue.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Recovered [player_stamina_max] fatigue!
{cps=50}Meanwhile the battle continues and those marauders who are still alive don't intend to surrender.
{cps=50}Fighting furiously they manage to one by one kill several of your comrades, forcing many of the militiamen to freeze in fear.
{cps=50}Only several bravest men continue to fight and they desperately need help.{w} But the corpses of comrades lying on the ground are a quick reminder of what an overconfidence might lead to.
{cps=50}Not willing to hide behind friends' back you ignore the danger and rush in.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 8!
{cps=50}Deciding not to risk it, you hand back: not retreating, but not trying to be a hero either.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 5!
{cps=50}This decision proves to be a wise one as marauders manage kill another half a dozen men, before they are finally surrounded and dealt with.
{cps=50}This tactics, however, definitely doesn't earn you any new friends, as those soldiers who fought in the first line don't really look kindly on you and other 'risk avoiders'.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}Despite their heavy resistance the surviving marauders are gradually encircled and picked off one by one.
{cps=50}The last one to fall is their leader, whose death officially signifies the end of your fist ever battle.
{cps=50}Comrades come to your aid and gradually encircle the surviving marauders...
{cps=50}Soon all of them are dead. All except one.
{cps=50}The last one alive is a brutish looking warrior, armed and equipped almost like a knight — with helmet, armor and shield. You easily identify him as the leader of the gang.
{cps=50}Cornered and surrounded, he spews all kinds of curses and, wildly rolling his eyes around, tries to guess where the next strike is going to come from.
{cps=50}Calling you and your comrades 'cowardly broads' and 'dishonourable dogs' he urges you to fight him fairly — one on one.
{cps=50}Nobody around, however, is showing any indications of an actual desire to fulfill his — probably dying — wish.
{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 5!
{cps=50}An honour is an honour, but there're no fools around. Encircling him with a wall of spears and swords, the militiamen carefully rain strikes on the enemy.
{cps=50}The shield, the armor and the helmet offer him a very well protection, but for every dozen of strikes blocked there's another dozen that wounds him.
{cps=50}...a couple of minutes later the man — badly bloodied and wounded all over — falls to the ground. His death signifies the end of your first ever battle.
{cps=50}To great surprise of your comrades — and partly even your own — you take a step forward.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!
{cps=50}Encouraged by the fact that a hopeless group beating has suddenly turned into a fair duel, marauder charges you with a loud battlecry.
{cps=50}Leaning towards your dying friend, you hear his last request - he asks you to find his mother and sister at home in England and tell them how he died.
{cps=50}The defeated enemy falls to the ground and his gear becomes your rightful reward.
{cps=50}Defeating a tough and well-armed enemy in a fair one on one combat earns you a lot of respect.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}The death of the last marauder signifies the end of your first ever battle.
{cps=50}York, occupied by the royal troops, proved to be a rather depressing sight with even a peasant like you, who has barely even seen a big city before, easily guessing that things aren't going that well around here.
{cps=50}Despite the fact that the Scots were yet to appear on the horizon, various rumours about their inevitable and devastating invasion have already managed to spread all around like wildfire, plunging everything into an uncontrolled chaos.
{cps=50}The gang of marauders that you've crushed outside the city walls was, according to the townsfolk, just one of many gangs that are terrorizing the region. Ever since the local nobles have decided to take shelter in their fortified castles, fearing the invasion, there was basically noone left to keep the bandits in check.
{cps=50}The mayor of York too decided to hide behind the city walls with; and, instead of taking any decisive actions, preferred to concentrate on writing daily and very tearful letters to the king, begging him for help. And when it comes to his men then he didn't really think of anything more clever than ordering all of them to guard his own residence day and night.
{cps=50}The city itself, overflown with refugees and various stranded travellers, reminded you of a mad ant colony, that each day gave birth to increasingly more wild rumours regarding the ongoing invasion. The wilder those speculations were, the more obcsenities and profanities featuring the mayor' mother were raised as toasts in local taverns.
{cps=50}This what York looked like when the king's army set camp near its wall.
{cps=50}Thanks to the information about the real location of the Scottish forces that you've managed to obtain, the English army had enough time to set up a fortified postion on the hills near the city. And when the enemy's banners finally appear on the horizon you're already in battle formation.
{cps=50}Thanks to the information about the location of the Scottish forces obtained by the scouts, the English army had enough time to set up a fortified postion on the hills near the city. And when the enemy's banners finally appear on the horizon you're already in battle formation.
{cps=50}Scots continue to approach English positions in marching columns and only when there's about half a league separating you, finally spread into some sort of battle formations.{w} But instead of charging the enemy right away they take a pause — recovering their strength and, perhaps, awaiting reinforcements.
{cps=50}Originally intending to hold a strictly defensive position, the English command starts to hesitate. In front of them was a weakened enemy, exhausted by a long march and obviously requiring some time to regain its combat capabilities. Seizing this moment to attack made a lot of sense.
{cps=50}But, on the other hand, any kind of attack implied leaving the fortified position behind which, again, meant sacrificing a guaranteed advantage.
{cps=50}After a brief military council, the command came up with an unexpected compromise — rather comfortable for the army in general, but promising nothing good for you personally.
{cps=50}Some light infantry, including militiamen, was to conduct a 'probing' attack and depending on its success the rest of the forces would either follow up or remain in a fortified position.
{cps=50}Throwing one last farewell glance at all the holes you've dug and sharp stakes you've placed, you sigh and, together with your comrades, leave the positions behind...
{cps=50}Unable to withstand your attack, the Scots begin slowly falling back...
{cps=50}At first the attack looks to be a success. The Scots, who haven't yet recovered from the march, cannot withstand the charge of a fresh force and soon begin to slowly fall back.
{cps=50}Crushing rank after rank, English infantry deeply wedges into enemy formation.{w} And bogs down.
{cps=50}For every enemy that is killed or forced to retreat — two new appear. As fight your way deeper and deeper into enemy formation, left and right flank of the Scottish force gradually start coming together somewhere behind your backs.
{cps=50}Hiding behind massive shields and wielding long spears, the Scots push English infantry into a disorgerly heap. Swiftly losing ground you and your comrades soon find yourselves being pressed harder and harder against your fellows, crushing and trampling one another.
{cps=50}Struggling to keep at least some semblance of spatial awareness, you, judging by what's happening, understand that you've probably been encircled...
{cps=50}Despite all your best attempts there's no chance of breaking through. With each passing minute the circle of enemies gets tighter and more of your comrades fall to the ground killed and wounded only to be then trampled into a bloody and muddy mess by their own allies.
{cps=50}And when you're almost ready to accept that this is how your story ends — the ground underneath you starts to shudder...
{cps=50}Shudder because several dozen mounted knights who, appearing from somewhere behind enemy backs, ram through the Scottish ranks at full speed shattering the whole enemy formation and forcing them into a chaotic retreat.
{cps=50}When one of the horsemen comes near you recognize him as Ruffin.
{cps=50}Kept you waiting, huh?
{cps=50}You sure did. I already thought that we'd been abandoned.
{cps=50}Nonsense! The earl doesn't leave his men behind.
{cps=50}As soon as he saw that you're pushing the Scots back he ordered to prepare the cavalry for attack.
{cps=50}And it seems like it all worked out.
{cps=50}Does it mean that... we won?
{cps=50}Even better! it means that Lady Luck is smiling at us and is offering us a very rare and precious opportunity...
{cps=50}To do some good old pillaging!
{cps=50}If we hurry we can get to the enemy camp together with the advancing cavalry. The Scots will be too busy fleeing and hiding in nearby woods to worry about saving their stuff so chances are the camp isn't even going to be guarded!
{cps=50}So what? You coming?
{cps=50}Good old pillaging, you say?
{cps=50}Then I'm in.
{cps=50}I think I've had enough adventures for today.
{cps=50}Are you serious!? The Scottish camp has to be full of loot! How can even think of turning down such an opportunity?
{cps=50}I don't know about you but during these last several hours I've survived through far too many close calls and I'm not taking any more unnecessary chances today.
{cps=50}I'm still alive and this is a good enough reward for me. I've had enough.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}At this moment you notice a slowly spreading blood stain on the gambeson under Ruffin's armor.
{cps=50}...And I think you've had enough too.
{cps=50}Despite his fierce protests you somehow manage to convince Ruffin to stay back and take care of his wound. The wound, fortunately, turns out to be not that serious and yet its effect soon shows. As soon as Ruffin's adrenaline rush wears out the pain instantly starts getting to him, swiftly suppressing his belligerent zeal.
{cps=50}The raid on the Scottish camp does happen, but neither of you takes part in it, watching from the sidelines as the events unfold on the horizon.
{cps=50}English knights, followed up by some eager militiamen, break into the unguarded camp and instantly begin franticly plundering it. Distracted by looting, they don't notice the approach of about a dozen well-armed Scottish horsemen who start a surprise counterattack. As soon as the battle breaks out, English horsemen instantly reatreat, leaving their infanty behind to be slaughtered by the enemy.
{cps=50}Exchanging meaningful glances you both agree that, in the end, staying back wasn't perhaps that bad of a decision.
{cps=50}Using this unfolding chaos to your advantage, you follow a small group of knights who, instead of running down the fleeing enemy, head straight towards the supposedly unguarded Scottish camp.
{cps=50}The camp does indeed turn out to seemingly be unguarded and, once inside, you all quickly spread around, hurrying to search through as many wagons and tents as possible in search of some fat spoils.
{cps=50}Ruffin — as an experienced fat loot enjoyer — immidiately heads to the center of the camp. And his gut doesn't fail him as there you find several richly decorated wagons loaded with all kinds of war spoils.
{cps=50}There's also a half a dozen of enemy soldiers fussing around — obviously trying to prepare the wagons to get as far away from here as possible.
{cps=50}As soon as they see you some of them run away but a couple decides to stay — ready to fight and rather die than give up the loot.
{cps=50}With all the enemy soldiers dealt with you hurry to search the wagons.
{cps=50}The enemy is fiercly resisting, forcing you to eventually retreat and then quickly taking off with their wagons. The biggest prize is now gone and you'll have to settle for something else.
{cps=50}The camp turns out to be full with all kinds of loot and, while stuffing your bag and pockets with valuables, you catch yourself thinking that maybe the life is not that bad in the end.
{cps=50}But this doesn't last long as seemingly defeated Scots conduct some sort of a sudden counterattack on the camp.
{cps=50}Seeing that well-armed enemy knights are entering the camp from the far side, you, despite the exhaustion, prepare to fight. But English knights, whom you've followed here, for some reason do not really share your belligerence and, after swiftly packing all the plundered goods, jump on horsebacks and begin turning back.
{cps=50}Puzzled by this behavior of theirs, you, however, do what Ruffin tells you to and, without wasting any time, join the knights in their retreat. This decision turns to be very timely as several of other militiamen, who were not quick enough to fall back, are surrounded and slaughtered by the Scots.
{cps=50}But you watch this sad picture from a safe distance.
{cps=50}SAMPLE TEXT.
{cps=50}The battle drags on. Perhaps, if you can last some more time, the allies will come to your aid.
{cps=50}!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
{cps=50}The battle on the hills near York ends in a decisive victory of the English forces.
{cps=50}Even despite some unpleasant mishaps that did take place and several more or less successful enemy counterattacks — the day ends with the Scots largely shattered and falling back.
{cps=50}The only two of their regiments that remained more or less intact were the cavalry and a large party of foreign mercenaries who managed to hold their ground in battle.
{cps=50}With many of enemy soldiers killed in combat and the subsequent chaotic retreat, while even more of them were scattered around in fear and panic, it really seemed to you, and many people else, that the Scottish army was now gone for good.
{cps=50}Watching the sunset and relaxing after a long day you were fairly convinced that the war was just won. But you're also noticed that the English army camp around you got a lot emptier...
{cps=50}The negotiations were to be held in manor of one of the local nobles that sat about half way between the city and the Scottish camp.
{cps=50}The Scottish side is represented by about fifty men and none of them are small fish — all knights and nobles with retinues. There's so much gold chains and polished armor around that your eyes begin to ripple.
{cps=50}The English side, represented only by the earl, mayor and two other lords, is way more humble in numbers, but not in pomposity as both the earl and mayor are sporting chains thicker than your wrist.
{cps=50}Another detail you notice right away is that not only does the English side turn out to be smaller by about a quarter, but it also has a about half a dozen or so militiamen who, when compared to the Scots, look horribly out of place.
{cps=50}After exchanged long ceremonial greetings, lords and knights proceed to the master chamber to hold the talks, leaving the servants, bodyguards and various members of the retinues behind in the main hall.
{cps=50}But before the doors of the chamber slam shut, the earl gives a few short orders to the sergeant, who nods and immidiately leaves the hall with a couple of his men.
{cps=50}With them gone, you start feeling even less comfortable than before as now you, Ruffin and a couple of your comrades find yourself all alone with the Scottish bodyguards. And, in case something happens, you have absolutely no chance of dealing with them.
{cps=50}But Ruffin is keeping his cool, acting almost as if it were the Scots who were outnumbered and outmatched. After a while his confidence gradually spreads to you and, when in about half an hour the manor's servants bring all of you wine and snacks, you too feel rather calm and collected.
{cps=50}The appearance of the free wine, of course, does not come unnoticed, and — after Ruffin nods in approval — none of the English have to be asked twice. Cups filled with wine quickly disperse from hand to hand with everybody taking a swig or two.
{cps=50}Seeing this picture unfold, the Scots, who didn't risk tasting the wine first, join in.
{cps=50}With everybody now partaking in this improvised feast you too decide to snatch some wine for yourself. But once the filled cup only so much as touches your lips Ruffin suddenly — surreptitiously but very firmly —  pokes you with an elbow.
{cps=50}'Don't even think about drinking this shit', — he says in an undertone while trying to make sure noone hears this conversation. 'Pretend that you do but don't swallow a drop'.
{cps=50}Guessing by his weird behaviour that this is no time for asking questions you silently oblige. And, for the next half an hour, diligently pretend to take a sip every now and then.
{cps=50}It doesn't take long for it to become clear what exactly did Ruffin save you from. All of a sudden everybody around you starts grabbing their throats while making weird, almost a deathrattle like, noises.{w} The grimaces of pain distort the faces of both your comrades and the Scots.
{cps=50}The only two men left untouched by this are, of course, Ruffin and you.
{cps=50}...{w}......{w}...
{cps=50}And just as you start to finally get an idea of what was going on the events begin unfolding at an even quicker pace. The doors of the main hall are pushed wide open and two heavily armed English soldiers rush in. Taking it as a sign Ruffin immediately draws his weapon and all three of them charge at the barely standing Scots.
{cps=50}The fight barely lasts a minute. Poisoned and choking with their own blood, the Scots can barely move and are easily killed.
{cps=50}You comrades, however, are hardly in any better position as some of them are lying on the ground, convulsing and making horrible noises. While others don't even move.
{cps=50}You think about helping them but one glance is enough to understand that it might be a little too late to administer first aid.{w} On top of that, nobody except you seems to even have a semblance of interest in their fate: after dealing with the bodyguards and making sure their throats are slit, Ruffin and the soldiers kick down the door to the negotiations chamber, ignoring everything else.
{cps=50}Not having much of choice you follow them.
{cps=50}Seeing that you're having troubles with your opponent, the sergeant sends another soldier to help you out.
{cps=50}The Scots try to resist but, affected by the poison, they obviously don't stand much of a chance and very soon all their negotiation party is butchered.
{cps=50}Keeping silent you patiently wait for either the earl or Ruffin to speak, hoping to finally get at least some sort of an explaination for all the madness that you've just witnessed. But neither of them deems you worthy of a clarification.
{cps=50}Through the open windows you hear sounds of another battle raging somewhere in the courtyard. The earl immediately orders you and Ruffin to go out there and help the sergeant and his men who are fighting the Scots outside.
{cps=50}In the courtyard there's a full scale battle going on as the rest of the Scots — untouched by poison and still very numerous — are trying to fight their way out of the manor. The sergeant with about a dozen of his men is blocking their way.
{cps=50}Ruffin enters the battle without hesitation.
{cps=50}You too join in right away.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 7!
{cps=50}You're borderline exhausted and decide to not take unnecessary chances fighting against fresh and well-armed enemies. So you prefer to hang back.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}Perhaps your passivity turns out to be the deciding factor as, after a short but bloody battle, the Scots manage to break through the English forces and successfully retreat from the manor.
{cps=50}This small victory, however, barely changes something in the grand scheme of things that have unfolded. All the Scottish leaders who've showed up for the negotiations are still dead leaving the invading army seemingly all but completely decapitated.
{cps=50}With nobody eager to voluntarily provide you any answers you decide that maybe it was time you started to demand some...
{cps=50}Despite all of your efforts the Scots still manage to break through and successfully retreat.
{cps=50}Still hoping to catch them, the sergeant orders a pursuit.
{cps=50}Ignoring wounds and fatigue you join the chase.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 2!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 2!
{cps=50}Ignoring fatigue you join the chase.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 2!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 2!
{cps=50}Back when you were still fighting in the courtyard of the manor, you noticed that one of the enemies blew his hunting horn making its thundering sounds roll all around the area.
{cps=50}The help that he was obviously asking for is not taking long to arrive. As the retreating Scots are heading towards a nearby grove, crossbowmen suddenly appear from the cover of the trees and bolts immediately start flying everywhere around you.
{cps=50}There have to be some pretty good shots on the enemy side as the first volley hits sevral targets right away. One of the men who fall to the ground is the sergeant.
{cps=50}Tables are turning fast and the predators are becoming the prey. Seeing that now it's them who have the advantage the Scots, reinforced by the crossbowmen, turn around and attack you.
{cps=50}Completely and thoroughly exhausted you cannot muster any energy to chase the retreating Scots preferring to stay back at the manor.
{cps=50}With herculean efforts you somehow manage to hold your ground. Unwilling to waste too much time on you and wary of coming English reinforcements, the Scots retreat to the grove and disappear.
{cps=50}The sergeant, much to his fortune, despite being hit with two shots ends up alive. One of the bolts recocheted from his gorget and the other struck him in the knee causing a painful but nonleathal wound.
{cps=50}Many others however did not fare that well: during the short battle the crossbowmen mowed down a lot of soldiers making some of them look like literal hedgehogs with dozens of bolts poking out of their bodies. This grim picture saddens you... And you begin frowning even harder when you remember the distorted faces of your poisoned comrades back at the manor.
{cps=50}If all of this was indeed someone's plan then it'd better been worth it.
{cps=50}The next few days pass in a relative calmness. But only in a relative one as, despite the recent success, the news and rumours that are coming to the English camp paint an increasingly grimer picture.
{cps=50}Even though pretty much decapitated, the invading army not only didn't scatter around but rather continued to grow in size. Primarily thanks to French reinforcements arriving pretty much daily.
{cps=50}Very soon everyone in the camp comes to understand the much dreaded second pitched battle — that the English command tried so hard to avoid — is at this point inevitable.
{cps=50}Thus, about a week after the bloody 'negotiations' that were supposed to put an end to the whole campaign, both armies met each other at the same precise positions as before — on the hills near the city. The English, once again, in the safety of their field fortifications and the Scots, once again, right in front of them — ready to attack.
{cps=50}Even though at this point the enemy already possessed a pretty considerable numerical superiority, the fortifications as well as hundreds of longbowmen stationed on a hill behind you, gave you and your comrades a decent confidence.
{cps=50}If last time you had success attacking then this time holding your ground shouldn't be a problem.
{cps=50}It was Ruffin who suddenly — and perhaps involuntarily — sowed the first seed of doubt by noticing that the earl for some reason decided not to dismount the knights. Instead of using them to strengthen the infantry lines he kept them mounted and moved to the side, as if preparing for a counterstrike.
{cps=50}Surely this was done with some sort of tactics in mind aimed at winning the battle. And the yet this noted absense of the elite units was dealing a solid blow to the overall confidence of the men around you.
{cps=50}The battle commenced at noon. The Scots began with advancing several regiments of light infantry towards your position, but met with an endless rain of arrows, they were swiftly forced back.
{cps=50}In a quarter of an hour the enemy repeats the attack — but this time with well-armed and well-armored heavy infantry.
{cps=50}They move slowly, hiding behind shields and taking almost no losses. Meanwhile the rain of arrows let loose by the archers seems to gradually become less and less massive as they maybe start to conserve ammunition.
{cps=50}The sight of this monolithic shieldwall that is slowly but inevitable creeping towards you quickly dispells all enthusiasm that you've got watching the first wave get mowed down.
{cps=50}The archers weren't saving you this time. You were on your own.
{cps=50}At first both sides manage to keep their formations intact, fighting pretty much wall to wall. But after a while heavily armed Scots start slowly pushing you back, wedging deeper into your ranks and soon both formations become completely mixed up as battle devolves into a chaotic slugfest.
{cps=50}Finding yourself right in the middle of the chaos, you try to keep closer to Ruffin who is furiously slashing away with his sword while dodging enemy strikes.
{cps=50}Suddenly arrows come raining down your heads, wounding allies and enemies alike. Having no idea what is going on you seize a moment to take a look back — and indeed it's the English archers who let loose volley after volley shooting indecriminately at the battle.
{cps=50}One of the arrows pierces the throat of a Scottish warrior who was about to strike you with an axe. An then another one, a moment later, hits Ruffin in the arm.
{cps=50}Several enemies immediately rush towards him eager to finish him.
{cps=50}Joining the forces you and Ruffin manage to fight them off and fall back to catch your breath and take a look around.
{cps=50}The situation on the battlefield keeps shifting. Letting loose one final volley the archers hastily turn back, retreating from the hill. And the knights are nowhere to be seen.
{cps=50}The Scots meanwhile continue their advance — several of their regiments are already flanking your position from left and right in a pincer movement.
{cps=50}And just when think that there is no way things can get any worse — they actually do.{w} On the hill behind you, that was just abandoned by the archers, you can now see cavalry. Cavalry with French banners.
{cps=50}The horsemen don't waste any time and, after forming a wedge, start heading towards you like an avalanche.
{cps=50}Screaming and shouting on top of your lungs you try to warn your comrades about the incoming attack. Those few, who hear your warnings in time, do indeed turn around trying to form some sort of shieldwall.
{cps=50}But all is futile. Galloping cavalry rams into your ranks at full speed destroying any and all resistance.
{cps=50}Knocked down by a horse you labouringly stand up — just in time to see Ruffin dueling an ironclad knight.
{cps=50}You want to come to his aid, but you are not fast enough.
{cps=50}With one fell swoup of his huge sword the knight shatters Ruffin's shield in half, chopping off his hand.{w} And then, incredibly swiftly, lands a second blow right on his face splitting Ruffin's head open.
{cps=50}The body falls to the ground. And even your limited knowledge in medicine is enough to tell that there's no standing up from that kind of strikes.
{cps=50}And, as if that was not enough, the knight then stomps Ruffin's head into the mud with his plate sabaton completely destroying what was left of your friend's face.
{cps=50}This ultraviolent act of pointless barbarity burns into your memory eclipsing anything that came before.
{cps=50}At this very moment, for the first time since you got to this war, you suddenly understand that you finally have something personal to fight for.
{cps=50}You fight like you have never fought before, giving your all.{w} But that is not enough.
{cps=50}Another strike drops you to the ground.{w} You try to get up but there's just no more strength left.
{cps=50}Watching the enemy slowly lift his sword for the finishing blow, you are faced with the face that you've just lost the single most important fight of your life. The only one that actually mattered.
{cps=50}Unable to change anything, in a fit of powerless rage you stretch your arm towards the sword that fell out of your hand, gritting the teeth and muttering curses.
{cps=50}Seeing you do this, the knight lowers his weapon and lifts the visor of his helmet.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And then, shutting the visor of his helmet, the knight disappers.
{cps=50}A minute later, completely overcome by pain and exhaustion, you lose consciousness.
{cps=50}You come to a while later, having completely lost any track of time. Stranger's hands are running around your body, emptying your pockets and relieving you of any kind of valuables or equipment.
{cps=50}Wounds and bloodloss make your body unresponsive; you barely feel anything and are surprised to see one of your hands still clutching hilt of a weapon.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tutorial — Siege and Assault.{vspace=5}Northampton ordered you to coordinate the siege and the following assault on Windsor.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The city is well protected and is very unlikely to be captured by a small force.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The strategy that has been proposed by the earl suggests multiple attacks that would gradually drain defenders' resources.{vspace=5}Assault the city, deal some damage to the enemy and then retreat to regain your strength and repeat the attack once you're ready.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Surrounded by the allies' forces, the city is cut off from any supplies, and thus the defenders will not be able to replenish any losses inflicted upon them.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}There are two ways to assault Windsor.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You can either attack the city together with your squad, personally leading the charge and subjecting yourself to risk.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Or gather a militia and then order it to assault the city while you stay in safety.{vspace=5}In order to gather a militia, talk to the sergeant. Some other influential characters might also offer you their help under fitting circumstances.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Even though the siege won't last forever and your time to capture the city is limited — bruteforcing your way in might not be the best idea, especially if you're having a hard time doing it. Look for allies and remember that sometimes it's better to lose gold than blood.

{cps=50}A breakout of yet another war between England and France was barely a surprise to anyone. The rivalry between the two kingdoms has lasted for more than a century, and small but regular armed conflicts have become commonplace for them. This war seemed to many to be an ordinary event, but the English king had other plans.{vspace=75}{color=#A9A9A9}Hold CTRL to skip text.
{cps=50}This time he had no interest in lesser goals and aimed as high as to ascend to the throne of France itself, using its ongoing dynasty crisis as a casus belli.
{cps=50}War preparations started by Edward III have surpassed any of his past military campaigns. Understanding the scope of his ambitions, the king of England did not delude himself. The war that he was about to embark on was going to be the greatest in history. And for an undertaking like that a proper army was in order.
{cps=50}The core of his forces, as it has always been, was constituted by the best of England's chivalry — eagerly awaiting their chance to finally outshine the French chevaliers and claim the laurels of the best in the world.
{cps=50}Struck down by an enemy blow, Bartholomew slowly sinks to the ground. One look at him is enough to immediately understand that he's not going to make it.
{cps=50}Leaning towards the dying man, you try to hear his last request addressed to you... but can no longer make out the words.
{cps=50}Giving you one last look in the eyes, Bartholomew breathes his last breath.
{cps=50}The course of the battle gradually changes. The confident onslaught of the English, which allowed you to take over a large section of the wall, is now slowly but surely fizzling out.
{cps=50}The French on the other hand, thanks to the constant flow of reinforcements, begin to push even harder, threatening to throw you off the wall very soon.
{cps=50}Right in the heart of battle you spot a tall knight leading and cheering the French soldiers.{w} Confidently wielding his halberd, he fights with such fury, as if he intends to win the battle just by himself.
{cps=50}Several of your comrades rush at him, but one by one they all fall dead from his heavy blows.
{cps=50}Despite the fatigue and exhaustion, you remain clear-minded and are able to see that this is the exact moment that might decide the fate of the whole assault.
{cps=50}The French, just like you, are standing on their last legs, and the death of the knight leading the defense cannot but topple their ranks.
{cps=50}With these thoughts in mind you take a step forward...
{cps=50}Despite the fatigue and exhaustion, you remain clear-minded and see that you're no match for a foe like that.
{cps=50}Especially after everything that you have been through today.
{cps=50}Seeing victory slip out of hands, your allies begin to pull back. Those closer to the ladders and siege towers hurriedly descend, while others are trying to slow down the French advance and cover the retreat.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}You bravely join those few remaining soldiers who continue to fight, and with combined efforts you win a little bit of time for the retreating.
{cps=50}Being among the last to leave the wall, you barely manage to make it out alive...
{cps=50}Fighting off the pursuing enemies, you receive several nasty wounds.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality lowered by 1!{vspace=5}Endurance lowered by 1!{vspace=5}Coordination lowered by 1!{vspace=5}Agility lowered by 1!
{cps=50}Your courage, however, clearly does not go unnoticed, and this act of bravery significantly increases the respect that your fellow soldiers have towards you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (the earl) increased by 5!
{cps=50}Realizing that things are about to go south and it is every man for himself, you lead the retreat and flee the wall among the first.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 15!
{cps=50}You manage to return to the camp safe and sound, but this action does leave a stain on your reputation.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 15!{vspace=5}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 3!
{cps=50}The fight is not going your way, and, in an attempt to save your life, you are forced to run to the laughter and hooting of the French.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 5!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}The air in the camp fills with tension as the English army is getting on for the second decisive assault. The initial plan of a lightning-fast campaign and fast advance into the French territory, as envisioned by the King, is not just at risk, it is about to come apart at the seams. Any delay can result in incalculable risks.
{cps=50}Reports from the farthest sentries indicate that the French King Jean II is already pulling in troops from all across his realms to the borders of the province. That means thousands of knights, including the very best of the French chevaliers.
{cps=50}Lingering at Cambrai for one more week would pretty much spell doom for the English army that will find itself stuck between a rock and a hard place — with impenetrable city walls on one side and French King's ironclad heavy cavalry on the other.
{cps=50}Seeking to delay the advance of the French troops and buy more time for another decisive offensive, King Edward allocates about a quarter of his troops to Thomas Marshall, a prominent English commander, to intercept and set back Jean's approaching forces, not yet joint together into one unstoppable army.
{cps=50}This bold move leaves no doubt that the events of the several upcoming days will decide the fate of the campaign.
{cps=50}The tension quickly spreads from lords and knights to sergeants and mere soldiers. And, when the time for the assault comes, the whole army is on edge, with every last man understanding the weight of the situation.
{cps=50}Learning their lesson from the previous failed attempts to storm the city, the English begin the assault by barraging the walls from all the available siege engines.
{cps=50}This time, however, this barrage is not chaotic and is only aimed at the several spots considered to be the weakest.
{cps=50}Tattered by the siege, the fortifications can barely withstand the onslaught. Soon several fragments of the walls start to crumble, creating gaps in what previously seemed to be an impenetrable defense.
{cps=50}The southern wall, which has suffered some of the most devastating blows, collapses almost by a quarter, creating a way into the city. Observing this, the King declares that section as the main attack direction and orders the infantry to advance.
{cps=50}Reluctant to risk his best men right away, Northampton orders his most competent soldiers, including you, to stay back and let the militiamen pave the way.
{cps=50}Having spilled enough of your own blood in previous battles, you're happy to oblige.
{cps=50}After about half an hour of wait, a courier arrives with the news that the southern wall has been pretty much entirely captured but the attacking force has been bogged down in the street fighting.
{cps=50}The King immediately orders reinforcements to head towards the southern wall to aid the militia. This second wave is led by the Prince himself, who has been told by his father to come back either the victor or a dead man.
{cps=50}Entering the city through the collapsed wall, you arrive just in time for a French counterattack.
{cps=50}And with the first wave already having been bled dry — the task of repelling it falls on your shoulders.
{cps=50}Despite Northampton's attempts to stop you, you simply cannot let your comrades fight and die on their own while you idly wait. Disobeying the orders, you head towards the city with the first wave of attackers.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) improved by 15!{vspace=5}Reputation (the earl) decreased by 3!
{cps=50}The first wave is met with a huge avalanche of arrows and bolts from the fortress' walls, hitting every other soldier that rushes towards it.
{cps=50}Several of your comrades fall dead right beside you, but you remain unharmed.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility check passed!
{cps=50}You too are grazed by one of the arrows which causes a light but very painful wound.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility check failed!{vspace=5}Health lowered by 5!
{cps=50}Bursting into the city through the destroyed wall, you immediately start pushing back the defenders, almost forcing them to flee, when suddenly an unknown sergeant appears behind French soldiers. Taking control of the action, he shouts orders and quickly starts to rebuild their crumbling defense.
{cps=50}Identifying him as a priority target, you immediately attack him...
{cps=50}Having fought your way to the sergeant, you kill him in close combat.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 7!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) increased by 5!
{cps=50}Shaken, the mass of the French warriors begins to fall back with only a couple of brave daredevils still eager to continue the fight.
{cps=50}You fight your way to the sergeant and attempt to kill him in close combat but fall short.
{cps=50}Reinvigorated by your failure, the French immediately go back on the offensive.
{cps=50}Even though the French counterattack ultimately results in failure, it manages to delay you and earn the enemy more time. Now, instead of a dozen disorganized men, the entrance to the city is protected by a fully assembled shield wall.
{cps=50}Immovable as a monolith, it easily repels one English attack after another.
{cps=50}Winded and bloodied, with each failed attempt your allies are less and less eager to continue pushing forward.
{cps=50}In the absence of volunteers it falls to you to lead another charge...
{cps=50}As it turns out, while you were trying to take the southern wall, Count Canterbury and his men managed to take Cambrai's northern wall that too was heavily damaged by the barrage...{w}And now it's been almost an hour since the city was captured.
{cps=50}From Northampton you learn that the decisive role in the battle was played by one particular warband of Count Canterbury's mercenaries — Ruffin and his men. They were the first ones to enter the city and then paved the way for the rest of the army.
{cps=50}As you reach the tent where injured de Roche is said to be in, your luck suddenly runs out — as the entrance is well protected by a group of heavily armed warriors.
{cps=50}Count Sunderland — the hand-to-hand fighting enthusiast — is exchanging whispers with Count Canterbury — the leader of mercenaries that were assembled for this campaign from every corner of Europe.
{cps=50}Both Earl Northampton and Prince Edward are nowhere to be seen, and the only at least somewhat familiar face belongs to Count Canterbury, who, surrounded by a bunch of his men, is fighting with the bodyguards of the French King.
{cps=50}The situation on the battlefield is changing...
{cps=50}The situation is changing. The battle might soon be coming to an end.
{cps=50}With your assistance, Count Canterbury's men manage to kill the French warriors in the bloody battle.
{cps=50}Chaotic fight in the forest quiets down just as suddenly as it broke out.
{cps=50}Just a few moments ago, you were in the thick of battle, exchanging furious blows with enemies, and now — just like that — everything was silent.
{cps=50}Looking for any kind of a familiar face, you awkwardly wander back and forth, tripping over tree roots and dead bodies.
{cps=50}After a while you stumble upon a large group of men, who are encircling a body lying on the ground.
{cps=50}In one of the figures you recognize Prince Edward, standing a little further away from everyone with a bloodied sword in his hand and a devastated gaze. He doesn't look like himself at all.
{cps=50}In another figure, sitting beside the dead body whose face is still obscure, you recognize Northampton.
{cps=50}Surrounding them are knights and lords — some of whom are still breathing heavily, with blood seeping down their armor and weapons.
{cps=50}Still having no idea what is going on and not daring to break the silence of the nobles, you freeze, patiently awaiting.
{cps=50}Luckily you don't have to wait long...
{cps=50}As the silence is interrupted by the earl.
{cps=50}Standing up and turning to the Prince, he raises his sword into the air and loudly says...
{cps=50}The King is dead.{w} Long live the King!
{cps=50}After a moment's hesitation, the crowd surrounding them follows his example and their shouts echo throughout the area.
{cps=50}An opportunity to get a full picture of what exactly has happened during the hunt is given to you only after some time, when the earl finally bothers to provide you with at least a brief explanation.
{cps=50}With nobody bothering to explain anything to you, an opportunity to get a full picture of what exactly has happened during the hunt appears only a while later — from rumours, contradictory eyewitness accounts and scraps of overheard conversations.
{cps=50}As it turns out, the peace talks were nothing but a ruse of the French who came up with an unthinkable villainy — an attempt to assassinate the English King as well as all of his most loyal lords.
{cps=50}The wine was spiked with some kind of poisonous brew, with which they intended to incapacitate the King's entourage, leaving them defenseless. But by some miracle their poison hadn't worked.
{cps=50}That left them no choice but to draw their swords and try to take the King's life with steel.
{cps=50}Further developments didn't really require an explanation as you've witnessed everything yourself. The King was killed in battle, but the prince, as well as the rest of the English lords, survived, rendering the enemy plan only partially successful.
{cps=50}And yet, as it turns out, the King's death was enough to sow the seeds of discord in the English camp. Now the whole army found itself pretty much split into two groups: with some of the lords — primarily Canterbury and Sunderland — insisting on continuing the war, while others — led by Northampton and Prince Edward — insisted on suing for peace.
{cps=50}At first glance, their stance might've seemed cowardly, but, according to Earl Northampton himself, things were not as easy as they seemed.
{cps=50}In his own words, the desire to seek peace with the French came not from cowardice or excessive friendliness, but rather from the fact that in this particular case the French were not the real enemy of the English crown...
{cps=50}...with a number of clues pointing not at French soldiers but at Count Canterbury's mercenaries as the real killers of the King.
{cps=50}These accusations were also reinforced by de Roche, who once again somehow managed to emerge unscathed from the chaotic battle in the forest and almost right after that had several private meetings with Northampton and Prince Edward.
{cps=50}Being in charge of all the royal mercenaries, Count Canterbury oversaw the vast finances that the crown spent on their military services. On top of that, he had the right to a substantial part of any and all war spoils due to occupying one of the key positions in the army.
{cps=50}Thus, even a peasant could make a pretty logical conclusion that the timely death of the King, who was about to make peace with the French, indeed benefited Canterbury much more than anyone else.
{cps=50}After several days of intensive thinking filled to the brim with countless meetings with various nobles and exchanging numerous messengers with the French — the Prince had finally come to a decision.
{cps=50}A lot of nobles were displeased with such a turn of events, and yet, despite all the efforts from Count Canterbury and his supporters, the army did not mutiny.
{cps=50}Exhausted by a long and rather unsuccessful campaign, the majority of soldiers and commanders were eager to return home — albeit without much war spoils.
{cps=50}However, even though the bulk of the forces remained loyal to the Prince, not everyone was willing to obey his orders. As soon as the decision to make peace with the French was announced, Count Canterbury — ignoring any and all subordination — abandoned the army and, accompanied by his retinue and some of the mercenaries, sailed back for England.
{cps=50}Sensing danger, Prince Edward hastily concluded all of his affairs on the continent, dismissing mercenaries and handing over what remained of the army to Thomas Marshall, whom he instructed to return the men home as soon as possible.
{cps=50}Having earned both the prince's and the earl's respect during the course of the French campaign, you receive an offer to join them and continue your service as a squire.
{cps=50}Given the urgency of the situation, you are forced to leave immediately, without even saying a proper goodbye to all the comrades and acquaintances you've managed to make.
{cps=50}The only person to whom you manage to say a proper farewell is your friend Bartholomew.
{cps=50}Saddened by the fact that you have to part ways, he nevertheless praises your wise choice and predicts a bright future in the capital for you. He also makes you promise that someday you will pay him a visit.
{cps=50}When asked about his own plans, Batholomew — now a hero of the final assault on Cambrai, rewarded by the King himself — replies that he's already got everything figured out. He's going to buy a small estate on the lower reaches of Thames, get a wife, kids and a bunch of voluptuous maids — to help him around the house, listen to his war stories and keep the drinks on ice.
{cps=50}When you ask him what he is going to do after the war — Bartholomew evasively replies that even though he didn't manage to get rich through his military career, he's already come up with a couple of 'schemes' of how to fix this situation once he's back home.
{cps=50}And thus the war comes to a conclusion — and with it, your stay in France.
{cps=50}With the King dead and Canterbury, Northampton, and Prince Edward now gone, the discipline in what remained of the English army took a serious change for the worse. Bands of mercenaries, assembled for this campaign with prospects of generous war spoils, all of a sudden found themselves without a leader and without a war — but with a bunch of unfulfilled promises instead. Considering themselves betrayed and lied to, they started deserting the army en masse — flooding the neighbouring regions and spreading a wildfire of small-scale wars and skirmishes all around this part of the kingdom.
{cps=50}The mysterious death of the King, followed by an abrupt conclusion to the war with England pretty much abandoning all of its continental allies, brought a collapse to the pre-war alliance. This resulted in the Flemish fleet refusing to aid in ferrying Thomas Marshall's forces back to the island, leaving this job to the much smaller and battered English fleet.
{cps=50}When asked about his own plans, Batholomew — now the hero of the final assault on Cambrai, rewarded by the King himself — replies that he's already got everything figured out. He's going to buy a small estate on the lower reaches of Thames, get a wife, kids and a bunch of voluptuous maids — to help him around the house, listen to his war stories and keep the drinks on ice.
{cps=50}In the opinion of the English king this failing campaign could still be saved and turned around — through one decisive battle that would see a complete defeat of the French.
{cps=50}What was happening at that time in the camp of the French king - you did not know. Already a few hours after the death of de Roche, rumors spread that the French barons were fleeing, leaving their overlord to fight off the English alone.
{cps=50}And indeed, while observing the enemy camp from the city walls, you yourself witnessed a lot of movement and various activity in it.
{cps=50}Unlike the fresh French, who had just arrived, Edward's army had been fighting for months. The realization that the flames of a war that had already ended was flaring up with renewed vigor did not at all contribute to raising one's spirits.
{cps=50}On the third day, when it became completely clear to the English command that the enemy army was not planning to scatter and its own army was rapidly losing its fighting spirit, the king decided not to wait any longer and attack now.
{cps=50}It was decided to fight outside the city, and, since no one needed another siege of several months, the French did not prevent the English from safely withdrawing troops from the city and deploying them in the field.
{cps=50}Thanks to your physical strength and craftsmanship, things are going well, and soon enough imposing fortifications rise in front of your position.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength, Crafting - success!
{cps=50}However, due to lack of physical strength and lack of habit of working with your hands, things are not going well for you, and, instead of imposing fortifications, something rather pathetic appears in front of your position.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength, Crafting — fail!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}However, the fortifications you have built prevent the French from easily breaking into your line.
{cps=50}The fortifications you built somehow help, but only partly, slowing down the French and preventing them from powerfully wedging into your formation, yet they do not have a strong effect.
{cps=50}Thanks to your impressive stamina, you easily break away from your pursuers and, together with other survivors, safely escape.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Stamina — success!
{cps=50}Your worst fears are confirmed in the late afternoon, when the prince, earl, and Counts Canterbury and Sunderland return to Cambrai with a small retinue of knights, escorting a covered wagon adorned with the French royal coat of arms.
{cps=50}But not everyone supported him. The leadership of the English army was quickly split into two irreconcilable camps with a clearly defined 'war party' - a group of influential commanders led by Counts Canterbury and Sunderland, who demanded bloody revenge for Edward and the continuation of the war to a victorious end.
{cps=50}Many people reacted with indignation to this turn of events, however, despite all the efforts of the supporters of Count Canterbury, there was still no mass discontent in the army.
{cps=50}Hearing about the conclusion of peace, Count Canterbury, spitting on subordination, left the army and, with a small detachment of his people, immediately left for England.
{cps=50}Your meager endurance, however, is not enough to sustain the grueling pace of the chase for long, and you soon fall to the ground, completely exhausted, becoming the enemy's prey.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance — fail!
{cps=50}You no longer have time to use the received weapon. Desperate to force you to retreat, the French pull up a detachment of crossbowmen to your position, which floods it with a hail of bolts.
{cps=50}One of them smashes right into your chest, knocking you unconscious.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality reduced by 3!
{cps=50}Exhausted and wounded, you end up captured by the French.
{cps=50}According to the numerous and conflicting rumors that gradually came to the French camp in the following weeks, there was a mercenary revolt led by several lords in the English camp shortly after the defeat and death of the king. Because of this, the Prince, already not too inclined to continue the war, was forced to seek peace with the French on any terms and, after its conclusion, hastily departed back to England to try to keep the throne.
{cps=50}However, the harsh conditions of imprisonment still affected your health, and very strongly.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}All stats lowered by 3!
{cps=50}We're here not to hide behind city walls. Me and my people are ready to fight for you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 3!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [suicide_squad.name!ti].{vspace=5}Rennes strength increased by 3!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}While you're coming up with an answer, Anna disappears in the depths of her lab.
{cps=50}During the voyage you think about your future and come to a conclusion that, after everything you've been through, you have zero desire to go back to quiet peasant life. And so you decide to continue your career as a mercenary, since the demand for them, considering the times, looks to be extremely high.
{cps=50}By agreement with the sailors, you are landed in Paris, where you hope to find a new job for yourself and your comrades.
{cps=50}You immediately understand who is in front of you and want to start chasing, but prudence still prevails. Wounded and exhausted, you can hardly stand on your feet from fatigue, so getting involved in another fight would be a suicidal idea.
{cps=50}As you watch the riders go, you wonder if you'll ever be able to face Ruffin again...
{cps=50}Guessing that these are the leaders of the rebels, you, nevertheless, hesitate for a second, not daring to immediately give chase.
{cps=50}At first, seeing the pursuer behind them, the fugitives accelerate, trying to break away. But after some time, having made sure that it won't be possible to flee, and it is only one person chasing them, they stop, allowing you to get close to them.
{cps=50}I've already kicked your ass in a fair fight, boy.{w} Don't make me do that again.
{cps=50}Because this time I won't spare you.
{cps=50}I've come to Rennes to settle a score with one particular man.{vspace=5}{w}It's done. And now I'm going to leave these lands and never come back.
{cps=50}I don't have a side in this conflict anymore. There's no one's banner above my head.
{cps=50}And I have no interest in killing you.
{cps=50}That might be so. But who said that {i}I{/i} have no interest in killing {i}you{/i}?
{cps=50}This is something personal, isn't it?
{cps=50}You should be careful with these kinds of grudges, boy. Revenge is not as tasty a dish as it might seem.
{cps=50}But once you bite into this pie, there'd be no going back. You'd have to finish it — or die trying.
{cps=50}So think carefully.
{cps=50}There's too much blood on your hands. I can't let you go.
{cps=50}You say my hands are covered in blood? Maybe so.
{cps=50}But take a look at yours.{w}{vspace=5}How many men have you killed?{w} How many families have you destroyed?{w} How much sorrow have you brought to this world?
{cps=50}How much gold have you taken off the dead bodies?
{cps=50}What is the difference between us?{w}{vspace=5}What makes you better than me?
{cps=50}You don't know a thing about me.
{cps=50}And you!? What the hell do you know about me!? About anything that is going on?
{cps=50}I know enough.
{cps=50}Realizing that it's over, Ruffin exhales. Exhales like a tired person, who has been carrying a heavy burden on his shoulders for a long time, and who now, finally, got rid of it.
{cps=50}{i}If you're used to living hard, Ruffin,{vspace=5}then dying should come easy.{/i}{vspace=15}{w}In the end the last word is yours.
{cps=50}You have won again! I can't even count the times I said these words...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Olivia) improved by 50!
{cps=50}After marrying Olivia and taking the title of duke, you move into a completely new role for yourself.
{cps=50}Over time, however, your relationship with Olivia begins to cool. The reason for this is some very strange hobbies of the duchess, which you, as a good Christian, cannot possibly accept.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue — fail!
{cps=50}If in the first months of your life together it all starts with a relatively harmless fortune-telling on cards, then soon you notice suspicious treatises on demonology and various heretical teachings in your spouse's possession.
{cps=50}In the future, even more terrifying rumors about abominable rites and rituals that the duchess performs in secret from prying eyes reach you.
{cps=50}Waking up one morning, you realize that it can't go on like this any longer and it's time to make some kind of decision.
{cps=50}Determined to find out what is going on, you share your suspicions with Dupont, hoping that the head of the guard will help you find the right solution.
{cps=50}Having carefully listened to your suspicions, Dupont agrees that the duchess should be temporarily placed under house arrest and thoroughly questioned about everything.
{cps=50}Dupont promises to do this today.
{cps=50}Satisfied that you have found a like-minded person, you leave his office in a somewhat elated mood.{w}{vspace=5}However, this joy does not last long, because an hour later Dupont's people come to you and take you under arrest.
{cps=50}You spend the night in solitary confinement, and in the morning Olivia comes to you.
{cps=50}Not wanting to repeat the fate of the late de Montfort, you decide that it would be safer to leave Rennes and make arrangements with the captain of one of the merchant ships preparing to sail from Brittany to the royal domain.
{cps=50}On the same day you board the ship and very soon Rennes is left astern.
{cps=50}Your relationship with Olivia is perfect, and you feel like you got everything you wanted out of life.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue — success!
{cps=50}For a while, thoughts of new adventures still haunt you, but when you wake up one morning, you suddenly clearly realize that you have nothing more to look for.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 1 of 10.
{cps=50}But this charm does not last forever. After a couple of years of a calm and happy life, you again begin to yearn for adventure and decide to go to Paris.
{cps=50}Terrified Olivia declares that she will not let you go and will force you to stay with her - even if this requires chaining you.
{cps=50}But before she can do anything, you board one of the merchant ships heading for the royal domain, and pretty soon Rennes is astern.
{cps=50}Despite Olivia's beauty and the all-round appeal of her proposal, a ducal title and a settled married life don't appeal to you, for your soul still yearns for adventure.
{cps=50}After refusing, you decide not to linger in Rennes and make arrangements with the captain of one of the merchant ships preparing to sail from Brittany to the royal domain.
{cps=50}Olivia, enraged by your actions, declares that she will not let you go and will force you to stay with her - even if it means putting you on a chain.
{cps=50}But before she can do anything, you board the ship, and pretty soon Rennes is astern.
{cps=50}When the city's defenses fail completely, it's every man for himself. Militias and civilians, pushing each other, fill the city streets, hurrying to get to the pier - the only salvation.
{cps=50}But only a few lucky ones manage to reach it - the city, torn apart by enemies and shrouded in flames, becomes a deadly trap for most of its inhabitants.
{cps=50}Miraculously, you manage to get to the pier too. Pushing aside the townsfolk and militia, you climb aboard one of the ships and, dumping the contents of your pockets in front of the captain, buy yourself a place on the ship, which immediately leaves.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue reduced by 40!{vspace= 5}Florins lost: [player_gold]!{vspace=5}Prestige lowered by 10!
{cps=50}So, having lost your squad and money, you leave Rennes astern to move into the unknown.
{cps=50}According to an agreement with the sailors, you are dropped off in Paris, where, according to them, a person like you can easily find a new job.
{cps=50}In Paris, you don't have to sit unemployed for a long time. The turbulent times created a huge demand for people in your profession, especially those who could boast of any kind of experience.
{cps=50}Despite your young age, you were a full-fledged veteran of two military campaigns, both of which were well-known, and therefore job offers poured in.
{cps=50}Most of them came from all sorts of large and small lords who had claims to the land of their neighbors or, on the contrary, wanted to protect themselves from such claims.
{cps=50}One of the proposals made to you, however, strongly stood out from this orderly row.
{cps=50}It came from Bernard de Chatillon, an influential lord from southern France, who sent his cousin to the capital of the kingdom to find suitable people.
{cps=50}In a conversation with you, he said that Seigneur de Chatillon needs a detachment of daredevils who are ready to go overseas - to Outremer - to find there and safely return his son, who went on a crusade.
{cps=50}After getting interested in this offer, you give your consent and go to the court of Bernard de Chatillon to conclude an official contract.
{cps=50}Of course, sire.{vspace=5}My name is...
{cps=50}I'm all ears, sire.
{cps=50}Your son, sire.{vspace=5}Who is he? What do I have to know about him?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Closing his eyes, Bernard takes a deep breath and continues to speak only after a lengthy pause.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}At these words the calm voice of Bernard de Chatillon starts shaking.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And every following phrase is getting harder and harder for him to utter.
{cps=50}This won't be an easy task, sire.{vspace=5}{w}I'd like the reward to reflect that.
{cps=50}Outremer is a vast place, sire. Where exactly am I to search for him?
{cps=50}I understand, sire.
{cps=50}You are spending the next few months on the most amazing journey of your life.
{cps=50}Leaving the Châtillon estate in June, you arrive in Marseille, from where you sail to Cyprus and safely reach Limassol by mid-July.
{cps=50}Thanks to the business connections of de Chatillon-senior, a long wait on the island is avoided and soon you board the ship again, where you overcome the last leg of the journey.
{cps=50}In the first days of August, the African shores, which seemed unattainably distant, finally appear before your eyes.
{cps=50}You arrive in Damietta.
{cps=50}Damietta is a major port city, serving as the main European bulwark in this part of Outremer.
{cps=50}Covered from the north by the sea, from the east by lakes, and from the south and west by powerful fortifications, Damietta seems to be an impregnable citadel capable of providing Christians with relative security even in this unfriendly land.
{cps=50}On the advice of the captain of the ship that brought you here, you begin your stay in Damietta with a visit of respect to the governor of the region, Arnaud de Lusignan.
{cps=50}From the moment you meet, the governor immediately makes a good impression on you. After thanking you for the tribute paid to him by this visit, he inquires at length about what brought you to Outremer.
{cps=50}Without saying too much, you convey in general terms the essence of the task received from Seigneur de Chatillon and ask the governor for assistance in the search.
{cps=50}He does not hesitate to say that he is ready to help you, but it will not be easy. Although his office tries to keep a record of all the soldiers who have arrived, these data cannot boast of absolute accuracy. And it would take a lot of time to dig through them as well.
{cps=50}Traveling in his footsteps is a dangerous undertaking, especially if you do not have any information about the course of hostilities and the whereabouts of numerous detachments of Saracens.
{cps=50}Not knowing what to do, you ask the governor for assistance in your search, offering your help in any matter in exchange.
{cps=50}The mention of your rich combat experience, as well as the fact that you arrived in Damietta at the head of a detachment, impresses the governor and he agrees to your proposal.
{cps=50}The plan he proposes is as follows: the first thing he would do is have his men go through the arrival lists to see if Renauld even made it to Damietta.
{cps=50}As soon as his name is found, it will be possible to proceed further.
{cps=50}As for you, you and your men at this time will help maintain order in the vicinity of Damietta. You won't sit idle, as just this morning news came of the capture of Farascur by the Saracens, an important staging post south of the city, which provides Damietta with maritime communication with Central and Southern Egypt.
{cps=50}Since the governor's own troops are engaged in heavy fighting with the rebels in the west, it is suggested that you be temporarily entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the city from the south.
{cps=50}You can't say that the governor's plan really inspires you, but the very fact that he is ready to assist you in your search provides strong hope for the success of your search. And you agree.
{cps=50}After shaking hands, you promise to report to the governor as soon as Farascur is safe again.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [war_in_the_east.name!ti].
{cps=50}Leaving the governor's residence through the courtyard, you meet a richly dressed young lady strolling through the garden.
{cps=50}The rules of proper conduct don't allow you to just walk past her without greeting, and you decide to introduce yourself.
{cps=50}You ignore her and go about your business.
{cps=50}When you lose the trail of Renauld de Chatillon in the endless expanse of Outremer, you resign yourself to the fact that you won't be able to find him.
{cps=50}With no money for the return trip, you decide to stay in Damietta in search of some way to make money. And since the only thing you're really good at is war, you don't really have a choice.
{cps=50}Having enlisted in the company of one of the newly arrived lords, you go with him on a campaign to the west, towards the fabulously rich, according to rumors, city of Damanhur.
{cps=50}Somewhere out there, in the vast western deserts, your trail is lost.
{cps=50}No one knows what your end was.{vspace=5}But that doesn't matter. For there is no one to mourn you anyway.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 2 of 10.
{cps=50}Considering your mission completed, you set off on your return journey, preparing to cross half the world again on your way home.
{cps=50}Somewhere here, during this journey, your trail is lost.
{cps=50}Whether your ship was swallowed up in the depths of the sea, whether you died at the hands of highway bandits, or simply settled in some place along the way - no one knows.
{cps=50}But this is not so important. For you have already played your part in history.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 3 of 10.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Not enough money!{vspace=5}1000 florins required.
{cps=50}During your search, however, Damietta manages to become your new home - not least thanks to the relationship with Emma, who lets you know that she does not mind spending the rest of her life together with you.
{cps=50}The governor, who clearly intended to marry his daughter to a more powerful man, hesitates at first. But your status as a noble warrior, as well as the numerous services rendered to him, outweighs and he blesses the marriage.
{cps=50}So, having crossed half the world, you find an unexpected haven here in Outremer.
{cps=50}And you live a generally happy life.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 4 of 10.
{cps=50}But the governor of Damietta, who clearly intended to marry his daughter to a more influential person, does not approve of your union.
{cps=50}In an effort to increase your authority in his eyes, you decide to make a name for yourself on the battlefield and enlist in the squad of one of the newly arrived lords. Under his banner, you are marching west, towards the fabulously rich, according to rumors, city of Damanhur.
{cps=50}But an ill-prepared expedition ends in failure, and somewhere out there, in the boundless western deserts, your trail is lost.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 5 of 10.
{cps=50}Disturbing rumors are reaching Damietta about a significantly increased pirate threat in the Mediterranean.
{cps=50}The captain of the ship, who, under an agreement with Bernard de Chatillon, was supposed to transport you back to Europe - and who has even received money for this, tells you that prices have now increased. And, in order to sail home you will have to pay him 1000 florins.
{cps=50}Otherwise, he will unilaterally consider the agreement terminated.
{cps=50}Your opponent, Count Canterbury, is one of the richest and most powerful men in all of England. He was one of those from whom the king himself borrowed money to finance his military adventure on the continent. In addition, for more than a decade, Canterbury acted as a link between the crown and mercenaries from around the world, whose services the English monarch regularly resorted to in numerous conflicts.
{cps=50}Honestly speaking, I'm not that impressed.
{cps=50}...it's not entirely clear - what's clear is that he intends to prevent me from ascending the throne.
{cps=50}But what is my task? It is unlikely that I will make a good negotiator. I'm afraid they won't let me in...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [genius_idea.name!ti]!
{cps=50}Impressed by your service and accomplishments, Prince Edward has decided to grant you a knighthood.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You have received the title of Knight bachelor.{vspace=5}Knighthood enables you to gather and lead your own warband. The sergeant can aid you with finding suitable candidates.
{cps=50}You've killed two of my men.
{cps=50}I'll skin you alive and then roast you on a spit like an animal!
{cps=50}With all of Canterbury's men dead the battle comes to an end.
{cps=50}Among the fallen you see Roger — with a hideous gaping wound all across the face and his mouth forever shut.
{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}Seeing that the battle is taking a turn not in your favor, you seize the opportunity to retreat.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Prestige lowered by 1!
{cps=50}Roger and his men are mocking you and hollering insults but they are too tired to give chase, allowing you to safely escape.
{cps=50}Unfortunately, in the process of fleeing you lose the sword that ends up in the hands of Canterbury's men.
{cps=50}And you make your way back to Dartford empty-handed...
{cps=50}But before you can do it, you're surrounded by a small crowd of peasants and monks, who thank you for saving them from being robbed — if not worse.
{cps=50}They want to reward you and you happily allow them to show their gratitude.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}100 florins received!
{cps=50}The road back to Dartford is uneventful.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [the_sword.name!ti]!
{cps=50}During the next two days warbands of various quality and size under all kinds of banners gradually begin flocking to Dartford from every corner of this part of the realm.
{cps=50}Once the castle and the surrounding grounds run out of space to accommodate the newcomers, this newly formed army moves to Greenwich which replaces Dartford as the main rally point.
{cps=50}Soon Dartford castle and its surroundings run out of space to accommodate all the newcomers, which leads Northampton to constantly remind you how useful it would have been to secure the Caldwell family's Greenwich estate as the main rally point.
{cps=50} Your first opportunity to acquaint yourself with the plan of the upcoming campaign comes on Saturday during the war council held by the prince and the earl for all of the counts and barons who have decided to support your cause.
{cps=50}According to the earl's spies, Canterbury — aware of the loyalist forces build-up — has secured a large sum of money from the Parliament and is now ceaselessly conscripting men and hiring mercenaries to form his own formidable and ever-expanding army.
{cps=50}On top of that, he is also said to daily receive endless caravans with supplies — so numerous that all of the roads to the north of the capital are crowded with wagons.
{cps=50}This scale of military preparations was an obvious sign that Canterbury was awfully serious and ready, if necessary, for a prolonged struggle, making him impossible to defeat in a war of attrition.
{cps=50}Against every soldier that Prince Edward had — Canterbury could easily muster two of his own. And, what's even more important, both of them would be well-armed, well-equipped, and well-fed for the whole course of the campaign.
{cps=50}Dartford and Greenwich were not the poorest places in the kingdom by far and yet they alone could hardly provide enough supplies for your forces for more than two or maybe three weeks. After that there'd be simply no more food left. And when there is no food — there is no army.
{cps=50}Dartford was not the poorest place in the kingdom by far and yet it alone could hardly provide enough supplies for your forces for more than two weeks. After that there'd be simply no more food left. And when there is no food — there is no army.
{cps=50}Thus, the seemingly only chance you had to come on top in the conflict was in acting decisively... and trying to turn the rebels' large-scale preparations against themselves.
{cps=50}Numerous forces that Canterbury has been assembling were still rather poorly controlled, rag-tag, and scattered in many places around the capital — some of them many miles away. And also only a few of them have already crossed the Thames while the majority was still to the north of London — unready for an immediate battle.
{cps=50}All of that effectively meant that the rebel army was split in two by long distance and a river, and thus those parts were unable to come to each other's aid.
{cps=50}With that, a large portion of the forces to the south of the Thames consisted of freshly conscripted soldiers who had zero military experience and had at best completed only basic training.
{cps=50}The core of rebel defence here was formed by Count Canterbury's personal warband of a couple dozen elite and highly experienced warriors...{w} some of whom met their end at Lindisfarne.
{cps=50}The core of rebel defence here was formed by Count Canterbury's personal warband of a couple dozen elite and highly experienced warriors.
{cps=50}If the loyalists were to strike fast and strike hard enough — the rebel defence could crumble.{w} And in this case Canterbury's apparent military supremacy could play a trick on him.
{cps=50}Having massive reserves to the north of London he is not likely to gamble away his most precious men in a seemingly losing battle. He, of course, won't hesitate to drown you in the blood of his fresh recruits but should they crumble — he will, most likely, order a retreat to protect his veterans.
{cps=50}Letting London fall into your hands.
{cps=50}And while so far every part of the plan did actually make at least some sense — it, for some reason, did not specify what was your next step {b}after{/b} taking the capital.
{cps=50}Next morning, at dawn, you advanced to the rebel position with the vanguard of Prince Edward's forces.
{cps=50}Thanks to the good location of Greenwich, the march does not drain a lot of your energy.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Success!
{cps=50}Failing to ally with Count Caldwell, you have to start the march from Dartford rather than Greenwich, forcing you to cover a lot of additional distance.{vspace=5}Exhausting march drains a lot of energy from you and your men.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}The quality of rebel forces becomes apparent as soon as you approach their camp.
{cps=50}Noticing your arrival, the enemy attempts to meet you in some kind of a battle formation. But instead of a solid immovable wall, it gives off an impression of a restless anthill.
{cps=50}Soldiers are chaotically running from place to place; commanders can't agree on the placements of their squads and shift them left and right; and the wooden wagons that are supposed to act as barricades are, for some reason, being set up way behind the lines.
{cps=50}It's all a mess.{w} The only men who seem to know what they're actually doing are a bunch of well-armed mounted warriors, standing to the side of the infantry formations with Count Canterbury's personal banner flying over their heads.
{cps=50}Observing this undescribable turmoil that envelopes the enemy forces, you immediately think that you simply cannot pass up this kind of opportunity. And, instead of awaiting the arrival of the main part of Prince Edward's army, you charge the rebel forces with only the vanguard, targeting one of their flanks — furthest away from the veterans.
{cps=50}This sudden attack catches rebels unprepared, forcing them to fight in a messy and disorganized formation.
{cps=50}Using their numerical superiority, the enemy tries to crush you through the sheer force of their numbers — but you manage to hold your ground long enough for the main reinforcements to arrive.
{cps=50}Unable to defeat your vanguard and now faced with the arrival of the main loyalist force, led by Prince Edward himself, the enemy begins to rapidly lose morale.
{cps=50}Seeing that the inexperienced part of his forces is coming dangerously close to routing, Canterbury orders his veterans to enter the battle...
{cps=50}Well, hello there, son!
{cps=50}It seems that the Fate is crossing our paths for a second time.
{cps=50}Which is very convenient as after our last encounter I ended up being a little in your debt...
{cps=50}But don't worry, son. This time I'm ready to return the favor.
{cps=50}With interest.
{cps=50}Nice to see you too, Roger.{w} I see you missed me?
{cps=50}Oh, you can't even imagine how.
{cps=50}Oh, I don't even have to imagine, Roger.{w} It's written all over your face.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Roaring with anger, Roger rushes forward...
{cps=50}Last time we met you showed us your impressive running skills...{w} Maybe this time you can show us how you fight.{w}{vspace=5}If, of course, you actually can fight, that is.
{cps=50}Only if you insist, Roger.
{cps=50}Watch and learn.
{cps=50}Canterbury's veterans, who have been through many wars, fight ferociously and at a certain point it almost seems like they can turn the tide of battle by themselves.{w} But there're too few of them to fully stifle the advance of the prince's forces.
{cps=50}The veterans are ready to continue the battle and fight to the death — but at this point, all their confidence and efforts cannot change a thing as the inexperienced soldiers have already begun a disorganised retreat that is more resembling a chaotic rout.
{cps=50}Soon the whole enemy formation is collapsing.
{cps=50}Standing above Roger's body, hardly further than a couple dozen paces away from the enemy, you can hear one of Roger's sergeants assuming command of what remains of his men, gathering all survivors around him and once again raising their banner.
{cps=50}However, instead of ordering a retreat, he rallies his comrades for an attack to recover the body of their fallen commander.{w} Lowering their visors, the men — exhausted and bloodied but unbroken and forever loyal — once again move forward.{w} This time fighting for something personal.
{cps=50}Seeing the fury with which veterans, driven by a sense of duty to their fallen brother, rush into this last suicidal blow, you involuntarily think about stepping back and allowing them to take Roger's body - avoiding a senseless meat grinder.
{cps=50}Looking around, you realize that neither Northampton nor the prince is nearby, and even the sergeant, whose advice you could count on in such a situation, was far on the left flank.
{cps=50}The decision is yours to make.
{cps=50}In confirmation of this responsibility, you notice numerous questioning glances from your comrades awaiting your order.
{cps=50}And judging by their battle-weary faces, they are clearly counting on you to order them to retreat. Moreover, this is the rare case when the manifestation of nobility in relation to the enemy will help save the lives of your own soldiers.
{cps=50}After all, the last thing you want is to get some more of your people killed in the last minutes of an already won battle. Or worse, die yourself.
{cps=50}By taking your men literally fifty steps back, you allow the veterans to take Roger's body from the battlefield, as well as several of their other fallen comrades, and quietly retreat from the battlefield.
{cps=50}Neither from your side nor from the side of the enemy no one comments on what happened, however, by the silent reaction of everyone around you, you understand that you did the right thing.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 15!{vspace=5}Prestige increased by 1!
{cps=50}But today, displaying generosity and nobility is not in your plans.{w} And you give your people, who are barely standing from fatigue, the order to stand to the death.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}In a hard-fought battle you stop a suicidal charge of Canterbury veterans, killing them one by one.
{cps=50}Already being surrounded, the last few people still continue to fight to the last drop of blood and die with weapons in their hands.
{cps=50}However, they carry a lot of your comrades with them away to the next world, thoroughly thinning the ranks of the best fighters of the army gathered by the prince.
{cps=50}Standing in the middle of a field littered with chopped and mutilated bodies, you estimate the ratio of losses and you feel uneasy.
{cps=50}You paid with the lives of at least five of the prince's soldiers for each Canterbury veteran you killed.
{cps=50}The alignment is just a little bit not in your favor.
{cps=50}Feeling that the battle is not going well, you give your men the order to withdraw.
{cps=50}After evacuating Roger's body from the battlefield, as well as the bodies of several more of their dead comrades, the people of Canterbury hastily retreat.
{cps=50}By tying you into battle, Canterbury's men buy enough time to evacuate Roger's body from the battlefield, as well as the bodies of several more of their other fallen comrades, before retreating.
{cps=50}Exhausted by the long battle, the prince's forces are unable to organize their pursuit...
{cps=50}A captivating sight, isn't it?
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Standing together with Northampton and Prince Edward, you watch the field of recent battle covered with bodies.
{cps=50}Here it is, [name]. The price of ambitions of a single man who decided that he's got what it takes to get the crown.
{cps=50}My crown.
{cps=50}If only he knew how far I'm prepared to go...
{cps=50}If only he knew...
{cps=50}Looks like your plan worked.
{cps=50}You sound surprised, [name].
{cps=50}Do I?
{cps=50}You do. While in reality it's us who should be surprised.
{cps=50}Why is that, sire?
{cps=50}Because we had no bloody idea that you'd be so stupid.
{cps=50}See that pile of corpses over there in the centre?
{cps=50}A pile of corpses of OUR soldiers?
{cps=50}It didn't have to be there. It shouldn't have. And it took someone's unbelievably awful decision for it to appear there.
{cps=50}Forcing Canterbury's veterans into a last stand was a really awful move, [name].{w} Especially considering that they were ready to back off.
{cps=50}Canterbury himself probably ordered them to retreat too. The only thing you had to do was let them.
{cps=50}We cannot afford to take these kinds of losses.{w} One more victory like that and we won't have any men left... While Canterbury will become the first ever general in history who won a war thanks to two defeats.
{cps=50}He too lost his best warriors today, yes — but it's a very small consolation for us.{vspace=5}{w}He can afford it. We can't.
{cps=50}I let you down. I'm sorry.
{cps=50}I'm used to only one kind of fighting — fighting to the death. Mine or the enemy's.{vspace=5}I was ready to die on that field together with everyone else.
{cps=50}Your honour is not at question here, [name]. And neither is your loyalty.
{cps=50}But you're not a wee lad with a burning heart and an empty head anymore. You're a knight. I trust you with the lives of my men. It's time to grow up.
{cps=50}Didn't I mention that the reason we took you with us from France was not because you're good with a sword, but because you're smart.{vspace=5}Or at least it seemed so at that point...
{cps=50}Don't disappoint us.
{cps=50}This battle is won, but the real challenges are still lying ahead.
{cps=50}Understood, sire.
{cps=50}Cheer up, lad. Just take this lesson to heart and don't do anything stupid in the future.
{cps=50}We don't fight the same way the French do. It's not about how many bodies you can throw at the problem — it's about making the least amount of mistakes.
{cps=50}Waging a war is a complicated business, [name].{vspace=5}Remember that.
{cps=50}Not at all, sire. I... The plan was great.
{cps=50}You're goddamn right it was!
{cps=50}All went as planned — one calculated strike and all this army that Canterbury's been gathering for weeks broke down and shattered like a clay pot dropped on the floor.
{cps=50}You did very well, [name]. Today you had to make several important decisions on your own — and you did not let me down.
{cps=50}It was your swift attack that prevented the rebels from setting up a proper battle formation and caused disarray. And a disorganized army — no matter how big — is just an uncontrollable crowd that would never defeat an organized force — no matter how tiny.
{cps=50}After the first hour everything was already over. Canterbury's elite did manage to escape, yes, but it was precisely what we expected.
{cps=50}Canterbury can afford to take any kind of losses — we can't.{w} At least for now.
{cps=50}I gave you my trust, [name]. And you did not let me down.
{cps=50}It means that it's time to see how you'll deal with a really important task.
{cps=50}As further events of the same day showed, the scale of the victory was really difficult to overestimate.
{cps=50}Having suffered a catastrophic defeat and having lost combat-ready forces on the south bank of the Thames, Canterbury decided to leave the capital completely and, together with all the people loyal to him, retreated in the direction of Oxford.
{cps=50}Looking at the wide grins with which Prince Edward and Northampton, at the head of a tiny vanguard, entered abandoned by the rebels London, you felt extremely strange.
{cps=50}It was very difficult to explain everything that happened with something other than huge luck. But the fact remained that, by some miracle, their latest crazy plan worked again.
{cps=50}After the ascetic modesty of Dartford, the capital residence of the king, in which you settled after the occupation of London, made a strong impression.
{cps=50}Huge wall-to-wall tapestries, stone and marble statues, silverware, and tall ceilings with chandeliers holding hundreds of candles.{vspace=5}The grandeur of the picture, which was the decoration of the royal estates, was breathtaking.
{cps=50}Even relatively modest by the standards of a royal residence, the chambers allocated to you personally easily turned out to be the most luxurious place you have ever had to live in.
{cps=50}To your considerable surprise, the capital itself, which found itself literally in the very center of the bloody struggle for the throne, seemed not to notice this at all.
{cps=50}The city was filled with people: the marketplaces were crowded, the shops of merchants were bursting with goods, waterfalls of ale and wine flowed in taverns and eateries, and loaded boats and ships scurried up and down the river non-stop.
{cps=50}The royal residence was also filled with servants. In response to your question - is it possible to trust these people, who only yesterday served Count Canterbury and his minions located here - Northampton only waved it off, saying that these scoundrels serve not kings, but their portraits on gold and silver coins.
{cps=50}And as long as these coins regularly go into their pockets, there is no point in doubting the loyalty of the servants.
{cps=50}The defeat of the rebel troops, the flight of Canterbury from the capital to Oxford, and the luxurious conditions of the royal residence lulled vigilance, making us think that the victory had already been won.
{cps=50}But, as you were about to find out, nothing was over yet.
{cps=50}Impressed by your service and accomplishments, Prince Edward has decided to grant you the title of Knight banneret.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You have received the title of Knight banneret.
{cps=50}A messenger appears to inform you that the earl is calling you to his office on some important matter.
{cps=50}When you arrive, you find Northampton and Prince Edward in the armory, where they are discussing something in a very cheerful mood.
{cps=50}Good news, [name]. It seems that our diplomatic efforts have had some success.
{cps=50}Canterbury is ready for negotiations.
{cps=50}I'm sure that it was the battle of Windsor rather than diplomacy that made up his mind.
{cps=50}He expected us to fail in retaking the city.{vspace=5}Seeing us successfully take it back might have shattered his idea of superiority over us. He might be thinking that our strength is more or less equal to his.
{cps=50}But let's not fool ourselves — there's no guarantee that he will take these negotiations seriously. And there's a high chance that he'll be using them as a ruse to buy time and see what we're up to.
{cps=50}No doubt.{w}{vspace=5}But that's exactly what we want.
{cps=50}... I'm not sure I'm following you, sire.
{cps=50}Why would we waste our time negotiating with rebels if we don't plan on reaching some kind of agreement with them?
{cps=50}Especially since time, as you said, is also on their side.
{cps=50}You see, [name]...{w} As I have already told you — smart general avoids big battles. Particularly those where too much would be at stake.
{cps=50}If a certain complicated problem can be solved with one stab of a dagger — then there's no need to march thousands of men to their death.{w}{vspace=5}Especially since you might unknowingly end up being one of them yourself.
{cps=50}I'm still not entirely understanding your point, sire.
{cps=50}That's alright. You will soon enough.
{cps=50}A small estate to the west of Windsor, owned by Baron Reading, who did not take sides in the war and volunteered to mediate in resolving the conflict and ending the bloodshed, is chosen as a place for negotiations.
{cps=50}Both sides were obliged not to bring troops closer than two miles to the estate, and groups of negotiators were to be represented only by lords with their inner circles - without additional protection.
{cps=50}An important condition that was supposed to guarantee the safety of the upcoming negotiations was the ban on wearing any armor for all members of the delegations without exception.
{cps=50}When you heard about this, at first you wanted to protest, stating that you did not trust Canterbury - especially after what he arranged for you in Cambridge. However, Northampton, for reasons unknown to you, remained perfectly calm and ordered you to do as you were told.
{cps=50}Your inability to acquire influential allies naturally leads the rebels to refuse any negotiations and, having completed the preparation of their forces, march on London.
{cps=50}Despite the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, you fight, hoping to reproduce the miracle that took place in the previous battle.
{cps=50}But this time luck turns against you and the battle turns into a rout for the loyalists.
{cps=50}You die on the battlefield.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 7 of 10.
{cps=50}You may not go into negotiations with overly conspicuous protective gear or a shield.
{cps=50}The loyalist delegation led by Prince Edward, in addition to Northampton and you (as a bodyguard and confidant of the earl), also naturally includes the Duke of Cambridge, who recently arrived in London at the head of his troops.
{cps=50}Without hiding his contempt for Northampton, the duke openly makes it clear to him and the prince that if anything in the negotiations goes against his wishes, he will not hesitate to go over to the side of the rebels.
{cps=50}According to him, it would be better if both of them kept quiet and gave him the opportunity to resolve the situation on his own. Especially since he knows how.
{cps=50}Faithful to the agreements, the rebels show up for negotiations in a small group and without armour.
{cps=50}They are led, of course, by Count Canterbury, but he is the only one in the group whom you recognize.
{cps=50}The only one except for another man whose face was deeply carved into your memory ever since the day you met him in France.
{cps=50}This time he accompanies Count Canterbury as a bodyguard, seemingly fulfilling the same role as you are for the earl.
{cps=50}His cold dark eyes carefully examine everyone present, lingering on you a little longer than on anyone else. But it looks like he doesn't recognize you.
{cps=50}Ruffin's appearance further increases the sense of danger that you've been having for a while now. But it's too late to change anything.
{cps=50}And thus the negotiations commence.
{cps=50}Gentlemen, we've gathered here today to determine the fate of the kingdom.
{cps=50}An unsuccessful campaign in France, that took the life of the king, killed a lot of most honourable men. But now the war is over — and yet the blood still continues to be spilled.{w}{vspace=5}Why is that?
{cps=50}And shouldn't we put an end to this?
{cps=50}I am convinced that everyone here is a loyal servant of the crown. And if that is the case, then it won't be hard for us to find understanding among each other.
{cps=50}Nice speech, {i}Prince{/i} Edward. Very inspiring.{w}{vspace=5}Definitely in your father's spirit, our late king.
{cps=50}The king who dragged us into a misguided conflict on the continent, who repeatedly failed to achieve a decisive victory on the battlefield and then, at the moment of truth, when we were one step away from finally being rewarded for our efforts — sued for a shameful peace with the French.
{cps=50}Not giving a single damn about everything that we've been through.{w} All the sacrifices that we've made. All the hardships that we've endured. All the blood that we've spilled.
{cps=50}Your father, Prince Edward, {i}owes{/i} us. Me and many other of his loyal vassals, who time after time responded to his calls, gathered under his banner and from our own pockets financed all of his war ventures...
{cps=50}...but never ended up getting anything in return for our service and loyalty.
{cps=50}You know it all too well, prince.
{cps=50}And if it is your honest desire to put an end to this bloodshed then there's only one way that can be done.
{cps=50}Step away from the crown.
{cps=50}A rare man is strong enough to carry a monarch's burden.
{cps=50}Your father was not that man.{w}{vspace=5}And now look what his rule has brought upon us.
{cps=50}Do not repeat his mistakes, prince.
{cps=50}And who do you think should get the crown, Alfred?
{cps=50}And don't call me Alfred.{w}{vspace=5}We might have been friends once, but those days are long gone.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And, turning to the earl, he adds.
{cps=50}Good idea, Henry. I was just about to suggest the same thing.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Trying to keep your voice down, you ask the earl.
{cps=50}Sire, is your name actually Jerome?
{cps=50}I knew you'd ask that, you dosser.{vspace=5}At least my name is Jerome and not [name].
{cps=50}When servants show up with beverages and snacks and wine starts flowing, the tension in the room does seem to ease off at least a bit. But that doesn't last long.
{cps=50}Just as you are about to reach for your freshly filled goblet, the Duke of Cambridge — who was the first to be served and the first to take a sip — makes a weird noise.
{cps=50}With a loud rattle he clutches his throat and tries to stand up but is unable to control his body and instead collapses to the floor where he continues to convulse.
{cps=50}It's almost like he's choking on something... {vspace=5}What that might be, I wonder.
{cps=50}His ambitions, perhaps?
{cps=50}Is that it, Henry?
{cps=50}Alas, no response.
{cps=50}And what about you, gentlemen? How are you feeling?{w}{vspace=5} No complaints?
{cps=50}I told you he's going to do that again.
{cps=50}You did.
{cps=50}For a man who spent so much time blaming me for dishonourable actions, you don't seem to be all that concerned about your own honour, Jerome.
{cps=50}Respectable men agree to sit at the same table with you in order to discuss important matters — and you attempt to poison them like a filthy yokel poisons rats in his cellar.
{cps=50}Even I don't remember falling this low.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Northampton shrugs his shoulders with a light chuckle.
{cps=50}I play the hand I was dealt.{w}{vspace=5}But if in order to win you have to pull an ace out of your sleeve — then why the hell not?
{cps=50}All is fair in love and war.
{cps=50}Well, some things were just not meant to be, {i}sire{/i}.{w}{vspace=5}Sometimes your past catches up to you when you least expect it.
{cps=50}I remember you, lad. Scottish campaign, a decade ago.{w} You were...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ruffin's hand goes down one of the pockets of his jacket, for a moment pulling down its collar.{w}{vspace=5} Allowing you to catch a glimpse of a chainmail under the cloth.
{cps=50}For my brothers.
{cps=50}Sire, they're wearing chainmails under their clothes!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Drawing a dagger out of his pocket, Ruffin hurls it forward in a single motion, aiming right at Northampton's chest.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Men from both sides of the table jump up reaching for their weapons.
{cps=50}Chainmails don't save Canterbury's bodyguards, and one by one they end up dead.
{cps=50}But while you were busy dealing with them, actions around you take a dramatic turn.
{cps=50}Eager to finish off Northampton, who is wounded by the thrown dagger, Ruffin charges at him around the table, running into baron Reading, who, in confusion, drew his sword along with everyone else.
{cps=50}But the mercenary has other plans and, disemboweling the baron like a pig, pushes him to the floor.{w}{vspace=5}Walking over Reading's brutalized but still breathing body, Ruffin continues to fight his way to Northampton.
{cps=50}And now the only — and the last — obstacle on his way to the earl are you.
{cps=50}Exchanging blows, you and Ruffin both keep glancing to another side of the room, where Prince Edward is duelling against Count Canterbury.
{cps=50}At first they seem equally matched, but very soon the prince starts gaining an advantage as he is both younger and faster as well as more skilled at fencing.
{cps=50}Time after time the tip of his sword pierces through the count's defences only to be stopped by the chainmail that he's wearing under the clothes.
{cps=50}Forced to back off under the prince's relentless offence, Canterbury asks Ruffin to come to his aid.
{cps=50}But all of Ruffin's attempts to reach his boss keep falling flat as you turn into an impassable obstacle on his path.
{cps=50}Meanwhile Canterbury's luck finally runs out and another sharp attack of Prince Edward cuts his throat.{w}{vspace=5}Letting go of his sword, the count sinks to the floor.
{cps=50}This is for my father, count.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Choking on his own blood and clutching the wounded throat, Canterbury struggles to speak.
{cps=50}I did...{w} what I believed was right.
{cps=50}Let this be...{w} a lesson for you, prince.
{cps=50}Don't repeat...
{cps=50}...your father's mistakes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Watching this scene unfold distracts you for just a fraction of a moment, but that is enough for Ruffin to grab a hold of your wrist, disarming you with one quick move.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And then knock you down with an elbow strike to the face.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You can already feel the steel of his sword on your throat when his finishing blow is interrupted by Count Canterbury's voice.
{cps=50}Ruffin...
{cps=50}I relieve you...{w} of duty.
{cps=50}You don't have...{w} to die here.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And with these words the count dies.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}At that very second, several more armed knights from the retinue of Baron Reading burst into the room through the open door.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Seeing how the balance of power is rapidly changing not in his favor, Ruffin chooses not to waste another second with you. Instead, in one big dash he gets to the window, knocks out the shutters, and jumps out of it onto the roof of an annex building.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Sliding down the roof he disappears into the courtyard.
{cps=50}Why the hell are you lying on the floor, [name]!? Get up and chase him!
{cps=50}Following Ruffin's example, you follow the path he has traveled with the agility and grace of a cat, and in a few jumps you also find yourself in the courtyard.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility, Coordination - success!
{cps=50}Following fleeing Ruffin, you try to repeat the path he has traveled, but your dexterity is not enough for such acrobatic tricks, and you fall from the roof of the outbuilding.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility, Coordination — fail!{vspace=5}Vitality reduced by 3!
{cps=50}In the courtyard, meanwhile, a real battle is already unfolding between the people of Baron Reading and the retinue of the prince on one side and the people of Canterbury on the other.
{cps=50}You notice how Ruffin, taking advantage of the chaos of the battle, slips out of the courtyard into the garden, from where one can quietly leave the estate.
{cps=50}You chase him.
{cps=50}Stop running away, you coward! Stand and fight!
{cps=50}I don't care about the outcome of this war. My men are in France. My service to the count is over.
{cps=50}I have no side in this conflict anymore. There's no one's banner above my head.
{cps=50}You should be careful with these kinds of grudges, boy. Obsessing about settling scores won't do you any good.
{cps=50}Believe you me.
{cps=50}You can hate and despise me all you want, but in truth we are not so different, you and I.
{cps=50}Just don't bring morals into this.
{cps=50}I remember you now. The last time I saw you, you were a dirty footsoldier. An errand boy.{vspace=5}And look at you now — a knight, a right-hand man to earls and princes.
{cps=50}That's quite a long road you've traveled. And I know perfectly well what these kinds of roads are paved with.{vspace=5}{w}And what does one have to step over on his way to the top.
{cps=50}And you!? What the hell do you know about me!? About anything that going on?
{cps=50}Is that so? Well then, tell me this.
{cps=50}Are you sure that there was no poison in your own wine cup?
{cps=50}You will understand one day, I'm sure. But that might be too late.
{cps=50}Enough talking.{w}{vspace=5}We've got some unfinished business.
{cps=50}You do understand that this time I will kill you?
{cps=50}I do.{w}{vspace=5}But that cuts both ways.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ruffin nods and draws his sword.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}As you lower your weapon, Ruffin gives you a barely noticeable nod.
{cps=50}Neither of us has to die here.
{cps=50}Sometimes, to win means just to stay alive.
{cps=50}Farewell, brother.
{cps=50}{i}If you're used to living hard, Ruffin,{vspace=5}then dying should come easy.{/i}{vspace=15}{w}The last word is yours.{vspace=5}{w}But at this point he doesn't really care.
{cps=50}When you come back, the battle is already completely over.
{cps=50}As word spreads through the ranks of the rebels about the death of Count Canterbury and the disappearance of Ruffin, their morale quickly vanishes.
{cps=50}Those who can retreat are fleeing, and the rest are quickly killed.
{cps=50}After climbing upstairs to the room where the negotiations were taking place, you find Prince Edward giving instructions to the captain of his bodyguards, as well as Northampton, around whom several healers fuss, providing first aid.
{cps=50}Are you all right, sire?
{cps=50}Never better. Except for a nasty bleeding wound in my stomach.
{cps=50}Doctors say that it was the thick lower jacket that saved me. If the blade would've penetrated just an inch deeper...
{cps=50}Then I'd be spending this evening in the company of Count Canterbury and Baron Reading.
{cps=50}I never thought that I'd be saying that to you, [name], but this is the rare occasion when I'm actually incredibly happy to still be seeing your face.
{cps=50}Talking about the baron. I knew him back before the war. He was at my engagement ceremony.{vspace=5}{w}He was a good man.
{cps=50}Yeah, poor fellow. Sad fate. But what can you do...{vspace=5}{w}As they say — good health to the deceased.
{cps=50}He wished for the kingdom to be in peace and this is exactly what he got. Even at the cost of his own life.
{cps=50}Does that mean that we won?
{cps=50}Yes. Canterbury with his wealth, cunningness, and authority was the force that held the rebel alliance together.{vspace=5}{w}With him out of the picture, they'll quickly get into a fight among themselves.
{cps=50}I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow morning two thirds of their Oxford camp are gone.
{cps=50}The war is won, [name].{vspace=5}{w}In a couple of days I will officially become the king.
{cps=50}And then what, sire?
{cps=50}Then? Then I'll have to tidy up this mess of a kingdom that I inherited from my father.
{cps=50}A failed expedition to France and a bloody civil war took a serious toll on the kingdom's well-being, my friend. So I'll have my hands full for quite a long time.
{cps=50}And when it comes to me — I believe I've earned some rest. Once the crown is placed on the prince's head, my promise to the old king will be fulfilled.
{cps=50}I think I've had enough of wars and adventures. Especially since lately they've been getting rather... bad for my health.
{cps=50}You've earned your rest, old friend.
{cps=50}Well, as for you, [name]...
{cps=50}I won't lie — you're one of the best warriors that I've ever seen and having you at the royal service would be my great pleasure.
{cps=50}Under the walls of Cambrai, in Dartford, in London, and at Windsor, you have always been true to your oath, and you deserve a proper reward.
{cps=50}You will be granted a small estate in some picturesque corner of the kingdom, and you will be able to spend the rest of your days there doing whatever it is your heart desires.
{cps=50}But if you want to continue the service then...
{cps=50}As you can see, the ranks of English lords have thinned quite a bit recently.{w} So it's about time someone got promoted...
{cps=50}You can become one of us.
{cps=50}I've spilled enough blood, sire. Both others' and my own.{vspace=5}{w}My war is over.
{cps=50}Alright. This is your choice, [name]. You've been loyal to me and I shall keep my word.
{cps=50}It was an honour to have you under my command.
{cps=50}Let's be honest, [name], you did sometimes act like a total buffoon...{vspace=5}{w}But I won't lie — a couple of times you did drag us out of an absolute ass of a situation.
{cps=50}And acted like a true hero.{vspace=5}So, I guess...
{cps=50}It was an honour for me too to have you under my command.
{cps=50}I'll be missing your stupid questions and that dumb look on your face.{vspace=5}{w}At least for the first two or three days.
{cps=50}Farewell, [name]. Be happy.{vspace=5}{w}You've deserved it.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 8 of 10.
{cps=50}I have no intention of leaving my service, sir. I have sworn allegiance to the crown and only death will set me free from that oath.
{cps=50}I'm glad you've made this choice, [name].{vspace=5}{w}I'm sure we've got a lot of victories ahead.
{cps=50}Thank you, sire.{vspace=5}It was an honour for me as well.
{cps=50}Alas, I'm afraid this is where our paths diverge: I step down and you move up.
{cps=50}Oh well...{w} This, I believe, is for the better. The hour of my generation has passed.
{cps=50}And now it's time for new heroes.
{cps=50}Prince - and now King Edward - kept his word and, soon after the coronation, you had the opportunity to get your own land allotment, and with it a full-fledged title of nobility.
{cps=50}There were several options to choose from: both near London, where you can enjoy all the amenities of metropolitan life, and in the outskirts of the kingdom, where you can take possession of rich, but far from the benefits of civilization, lands.
{cps=50}You choose Arlington Manor, near London, and become a baron.
{cps=50}You choose Scarborough Manor, near Nottingham, and become a count.
{cps=50}You choose Hereford Estate, on the border with Wales, and become a viscount.
{cps=50}For the first time in your life, you have not only your own house and land but also servants who are ready to fulfill any task.
{cps=50}The title of nobility, combined with the status of the hero of two past wars, causes universal respect for you - including from people who would not even talk to you until recently.
{cps=50}Pretty soon you forget that you were once a poor peasant who worked in the fields for pennies, or a dirty militiaman who dug trenches and cesspools.
{cps=50}However, it is not destined to enjoy this new life for a long time, and, about a month after the coronation, bad news comes from the north.
{cps=50}The Scots, to whom Count Canterbury sent envoys, have crossed the northern borders of the kingdom and are approaching York with unclear goals.
{cps=50}You have been assigned to lead the royal troops advancing north.
{cps=50}One week was allotted for training.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Added a new quest - [going_north.name!ti].
{cps=50}The troops gathered by King Edward to march north are nothing compared to the grandiose army with which you once invaded France.
{cps=50}The unsuccessful campaign on the continent and the ensuing bloody civil war seriously depleted the kingdom's reserves. And so now we had to rely on very modest forces.
{cps=50}A small consolation could only be the fact that the king ordered you to regularly inform him about the course of events and promised, if necessary, to send reinforcements as soon as possible.
{cps=50}Another unexpected reason for joy was the news that an old sergeant decided to go north with you.
{cps=50}Having spent his whole life in military camps and campaigns, he did not see himself in civilian life and, released from service by Northampton, he preferred to re-enlist in the royal army.
{cps=50}You were glad to meet an old acquaintance, especially one you could rely on.
{cps=50}The purpose of your campaign is the northern outpost of the kingdom - the city of York, from whose mayor the news of the impending invasion of the Scots was received.
{cps=50}And so, leaving London to the north, for the first time you find yourself at the head of your own army.
{cps=50}Managing a full-fledged army, even if relatively small in size, turned out to be not an easy task.
{cps=50}However, thanks to your prestige, you handle it brilliantly.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}However, thanks to your authority, you coped with it. Albeit not without problems.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — neutral result!
{cps=50}And your authority is clearly not enough for this task.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige - fail (required: 75)!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) reduced by 15!
{cps=50}Under your leadership, the army is rapidly advancing.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) - success!
{cps=50}Due to problems with troop management, the pace of advancement leaves much to be desired.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) — fail!{vspace=5}Fatigue increased!
{cps=50}Nature itself throws you another challenge. After your forces pass Nottingham, the weather begins to deteriorate rapidly and heavy rains soon hit.
{cps=50}Day after day of downpours turn all the surrounding roads into a muddy swamp, making it difficult to move. There is only a few days' march to York, but the pace of traffic drops to a snail's pace.
{cps=50}During one of the forced halts, when soldiers are pulling wagons stuck in the mud and drying their soaked-through clothes, an envoy from York arrives at the camp with disturbing news.
{cps=50}Realizing that every hour is precious and seeing that the weather is not going to get any better, you decide to rush forward with only a small detachment, leaving the main forces behind.
{cps=50}York turns out to be a large city with dilapidated but still massive fortifications, under the protection of which thousands of people from all over the area flocked.
{cps=50}Flooded with endless rains, buried in mud, and packed with refugees to the eyeballs, the city is a pitiful sight.
{cps=50}God damn, it's been years since I've been here last, but this place is absolutely the same.
{cps=50}Same dirt, same crowds of vagabonds on the streets, same Scottish invasion looming on the horizon. Same old mess.
{cps=50}Judging by what I see, the city is not ready for a siege. Not in the slightest.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [whats_going_on.name!ti].
{cps=50}Wasting no time, you head straight to the mayor's residence, but there you will be disappointed - the mayor is not there.
{cps=50}His people respond to your questions extremely briefly and vaguely, stating that the burgomaster has left on business, and where exactly— is none of their business.
{cps=50}Questions regarding the location of the Scottish troops, as well as the state of affairs in the city, are also perceived by them with absolute apathy and remain without a specific answer.
{cps=50}The feeling that something is obviously wrong here immediately creeps into your head.
{cps=50}Bewildered by the coldness and taciturnity of the steward and the captain of the guard, you find yourself even more surprised when one of the maids unexpectedly approaches you and, making sure that no one is around, starts talking...
{cps=50}Forgive me my rudeness, sire...{vspace=5}{w}I heard you talking to the steward about the mayor and thought I could be of help.
{cps=50}What's your name?
{cps=50}My name is Lina, sire. I am a maid here at the residence.{vspace=5}I keep the place clean and also help in the kitchen.
{cps=50}My father got me this job a couple of years ago. My family comes from a village nearby...
{cps=50}At first they told us that there's no need for a maid, but once they have tasted my cooking — they changed their mind.
{cps=50}Why do you want to help me?
{cps=50}I know who you are.
{cps=50}[name], [player_full_title!ti]. Rumours spread quickly here in York. People say that the king has sent you here to save us. To protect from the Scots and to finally bring order to the northern lands.
{cps=50}For an ordinary maid you're rather well informed. It's all correct.{vspace=5}But, judging by the behavior of the steward and the captain of the guard — they don't seem to be all that concerned with any of those issues.
{cps=50}It's the mayor, sire. When I first got here he was... different. Normal. He kept track of city affairs, fought crime.{vspace=5}But about a year and a half ago, something began to happen to him.
{cps=50}It's almost as if he turned into another man.
{cps=50}What's that supposed to mean? Don't speak in riddles.
{cps=50}I'm just a maid, sire.{vspace=5}I might hear a thing or two now and again but no one's letting me in on any serious affairs.
{cps=50}Especially not the mayor.
{cps=50}Tell me everything you know.
{cps=50}I was telling you! So just like I said, about a year or so ago something happened to him. He started to change — became detached, secluded, acting weird. Almost ceased to show up in public.
{cps=50}And then all of a sudden charged his own son with treason and ordered to execute him.{vspace=5}May God rest his soul.
{cps=50}After that, pretty much on the next day, he threw out all of his old counselors and advisors from the local nobility who have been helping him to manage the city and replaced them with... With I don't even know who.
{cps=50}Now nobody is watching over the city. It's gotten to the point where it was the head of the local trade guild who informed the king about this Scottish invasion.{vspace=5}Mayor doesn't seem to care at all.
{cps=50}That's... intriguing. And what might be the reason for such a change in his character?
{cps=50}I have no slightest idea. You'll have to ask him.
{cps=50}I would love to do that but he is nowhere to be found.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}I'm pretty sure he's in prison right now.
{cps=50}...!?{vspace=5}{w}What do you mean — in prison!?
{cps=50}That's what we call an ancient fort at the western end of the city across the river.{vspace=5}Since all the criminals are kept there.
{cps=50}In recent months the mayor has been regularly visiting it with his bodyguards.{vspace=5}It's the only place where he can be found if he's not in the residence.
{cps=50}And what the hell is he doing there?
{cps=50}Sire, I'm a maid, not a spy! And it's really not in my habit to stick my nose into somebody else's business.
{cps=50}Well, maybe only a little.
{cps=50}Thank you for the help. I'll pay a visit to that prison of yours.
{cps=50}I am so happy to see you here, sire.{vspace=5}I already feel much safer.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Lina) improved by 10!
{cps=50}You can easily find the prison building that Lina was talking about.{vspace=5}Rain and a cloudy sky give the already gloomy-looking fort a completely infernal look...{w} as if turning it into a grim omen of future troubles.
{cps=50}Cold and twilight reign inside, which are only in some places pierced by the light of rare candles. A booming echo carries throughout the building the howling of the wind, the splashing of drops of water falling from the roof, and the heavy groans of the prisoners.
{cps=50}The guards inside are trying to block your way, but the mention of the king's name brings them to their senses.
{cps=50}Following the instructions of the guard, who informed you that the burgomaster is on the lowest tier, you descend down the spiral staircase, passing level after level.
{cps=50}With each new flight of stairs you dive deeper into the darkness and, finally finding yourself on the lowest tier, you plunge into complete impenetrable blackness like an ocean.
{cps=50}After half a minute, when your eyes get used to the darkness, you notice a reflection of torchlight in the depths of the corridor, and also catch snippets of words spoken in a half-whisper.
{cps=50}As you move to the light, you step forward carefully, step by step.{w} Carefully enough to stop in time when the icy blade of a sword rests on your chest.
{cps=50}Lower you sword. Do you have any idea who you're talking to?
{cps=50}I've arrived in York on behalf of the king. And the king requires no invitations.
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}The tip of the stranger's sword is aimed right at your heart.
{cps=50}How dare you speak to me like that?
{cps=50}I'm giving you the second and the last warning: lower the sword or I will break it over your head.
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}With all your speed you reach for the scabbard, but the moment your hand touches the hilt of the sword, the stranger's blade is already at your throat.
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}It is so sharp that it immediately leaves a small wound, from which a few drops of blood appear.{vspace=5}{w}Realizing that the odds are not in your favor, you freeze without drawing your weapon.
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}An appearance of the mayor lowers the tension and makes the stranger put away his sword.
{cps=50}We have received a letter asking for help. And with it, numerous reports of the invasion of the Scottish armies into the borderlands.
{cps=50}The king has made a decision to send an army to protect York. This force is led by me — [name], [player_full_title!ti].
{cps=50}Roads are impassable due to bad weather. My forces remained a few days' march from here. I arrived in the city with only a small vanguard.
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}Mayor points at the man beside him.
{cps=50}Forgive me my rudeness, mayor, but the reason I've dragged myself here all the way from the south is neither rest and relaxation in your residence nor making new friends.
{cps=50}I'm here to protect the city from the invaders, and the only thing that I would like to hear from you is — where is the enemy, how numerous are they and how is the city preparing for the defence.
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}The more he talks, the more bewildered you get.
{cps=50}What do you mean 'safe'? The city's full of refugees and everyone around is talking about a massive Scottish army coming from the north...
{cps=50}I will choose to trust my own eyes then and take a ride to the outposts.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [watchmen.name!ti].
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}The mayor shurgs his shoulders in disappointment.
{cps=50}I will keep that in mind.
{cps=50}As promised by James, the next morning Scottish forces begin their assault on the city.
{cps=50}Observing the enemy camp from the city walls, you notice multiple signs of the upcoming assault.
{cps=50}And true to these observations, the next morning Scottish forces begin their attack on the city.
{cps=50}Less than two days after your arrival in York, a large Scottish army appears under the walls of the city.
{cps=50}Overwhelming superiority in numbers allows them to attack the walls from several - most vulnerable - sides at once, located at a great distance from each other.
{cps=50}Having placed the city guards in their places and distributed the areas of responsibility between your few detachments, you and the sergeant find yourself at opposite ends of the fortress.
{cps=50}As you part, you exchange wishes of good luck and promise each other that you will survive this day...{vspace=5}{w}Knowing well that the chances of that are slim.
{cps=50}You somehow manage to stifle the onslaught of the first wave, but the enemy is far from being done.
{cps=50}Despite the fury with which you fight, a miracle does not happen. In place of each enemy soldier you kill — another two show up. You stand your ground for as long as you can, but nothing can turn the tide of battle.
{cps=50}Wounded and encircled by enemies, you lose the ability to defend yourself. And this is when the final blow comes.
{cps=50}Slowly falling from the city wall, you see the triumphant enemies raise their banner.
{cps=50}You close your eyes, and when the body finally reaches the ground, you cannot feel the impact.
{cps=50}To be a warrior — is to live forever.

{cps=50}Rumors of that King Edward, who was heavily wounded in battle and now is barely clinging to life, immediately spread throughout the city.
{cps=50}And closer to midnight, when you are on guard on one of the fortress walls, watching the celebration in John's camp, the bells of the city churches, one by one, start to toll. Marking the end of the life of another English monarch.
{cps=50}After hearing about the conclusion of peace, Count Canterbury, spitting on subordination, left the army and, with a small detachment of his people, immediately left for England.
{cps=50}With the situation not tolerating any delay, you are forced to leave immediately, without even saying a proper goodbye to all the comrades and acquaintances you've managed to make.
{cps=50}Saddened by the fact that you have to part ways, he nevertheless praises your wise choice and predicts you a bright future in the capital. He also makes you promise that someday you will pay him a visit.

{cps=50}If in the first months of your life together it all starts with a relatively harmless fortune-telling on the cards, then soon you notice suspicious treatises on demonology and various heretical teachings in your spouse's possession.
{cps=50}In the future, even more terrifying rumors about poisonous rites and rituals that the duchess performs in secret from prying eyes reach you.
{cps=50}On the same day you board the ship, and very soon Rennes is left astern.

{cps=50}The only thing that is known is that Bernard de Chatillon never saw you return back to him.
{cps=50}But merciless time will not be kind to you, and just one generation later you will already be forgotten. As many other heroes of the past were forgotten and as many of those who will come after you will be forgotten too.

{cps=50}Our paths have crossed once before, boy.{w} You won't survive a second time.
{cps=50}Some grudges cannot be forgiven.{w} No matter how much time has passed.
{cps=50}I've sworn that I'll hunt you to the ends of the earth... And now that we're finally face to face, I will make you pay.
{cps=50}Make me pay, you say?{w}{vspace=5}Well, fate is not without a sense of irony.
{cps=50}The only reason I dragged myself to Rennes was precisely to settle the score with a certain longtime debtor of mine.
{cps=50}If it's the same reason that brought you here - so be it, I won't refuse you.
{cps=50}Now that my vengeance is fulfilled, dying by your sword would be even... poetic.
{cps=50}Well then? Let us see how badly you want to claim your revenge.
{cps=50}Apparently, you and I have more in common than it might seem at first sight.
{cps=50}Enough talk, Ruffin.{w}{vspace=5}We have unfinished business.
{cps=50}You do realize that this time I'll kill you, right?
{cps=50}Yes.{w}{vspace=5}I hope that you realize this as well.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Ruffin curtly nods and draws his sword.

{cps=50}The plan strikes you as absurd and foolish, while the idea of betraying the prince and the earl for the sake of highly dubious prospects appears downright moronic.

{cps=50}You again, eh? Need your junk repaired?
{cps=50}Fine, I'll see what I can do. But money first — no delays and no discounts!
{cps=50}These are the times we live in. If I can't even trust a bloody knight, then there's no way I'm going to trust a bum like you!
{cps=50}Well, neither would Hoggard, Lord curse his name! Got me to fetch something for him, promised to pay but never showed up.
{cps=50}About two weeks back that drunkard parody of a knight commissioned me to get him a chest — 'for spoils and trophies'.
{cps=50}For all this time he's been constantly hurrying me to get it done faster. Even tried giving me — ME — advice!

Heads Will Roll uses a turn-based combat system. All characters participating in the battle take turns in the following order: you, your allies, and your opponents (left to right).
This order never changes. A character's turn can be skipped only in one case — if that character has a 'stunned' effect applied to them.
At the beginning of each turn, the player can choose one of several actions — all of them are listed on the character control panel in the lower right corner.
Attack.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for attacking with your main weapon. Upon clicking it, you will have to select a target to attack, a particular move to use and, lastly, a part of the enemy's body to target.
Feint.{vspace=5}This button allows you to execute a feint with your main weapon.
A feint is a deceptive move that distracts your opponent. A successful feint will drain some of the target's Stamina while applying an attack accuracy debuff that lasts for 1 turn.
Shield.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for actions with a shield (if your character has one).
A successful shield bash can stun the enemy, making them skip their next turn and massively decreasing their evasion. Stunned characters are unable to block incoming attacks — even with a shield equipped.
Crossbow.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for actions with the crossbow (if your character has one).
Stances.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for changing stances.
Recover.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for restoring Stamina. The effectiveness of Recover and the amount of Stamina recovered depend on the character's Coordination.
Items.{vspace=5}This button brings up a list of items that can be used. These items can be bandages, antidotes, flasks, alcohol, etc.
The full list of items (including crossbow ammunition) that you're currently carrying can be viewed by pressing the Pouch button. It is located at the bottom left.
Respite.{vspace=5}This button is responsible for lowering your Fatigue level in battle. The general principles of Respite are similar to those of Recover, and the amount of recovered Fatigue also depends on your Coordination.
The 'Character' button will bring up a menu with all of your stats, injuries, and active effects.
Injuries and active effects will also be displayed in the lower panel, above the health and stamina bars.
Information about your enemies will be located in the upper right part of the screen. Click their icons to see this information.
Injuries.{vspace=5}You and your opponent can attack each other's body parts. Each body part has different damage multipliers, different armor value and armor coverage (depending on the items worn), as well as different injuries associated with them.
For example, successful strikes to the limbs may result in a broken leg or damaged arm muscles, which lower Agility or Weapon Skill, respectively.
The severity of injuries depends on the Strength of the attacker.
Fatigue.{vspace=5}The last aspect to be discussed is Fatigue.

{cps=50}Recovering a little, you realize that you were miraculously saved by the poor accuracy of the shooter; the bolt only grazed you, passing close to the body and leaving a bloody, but shallow wound.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality lowered by 2!

{cps=50}As he sends you on your way, he promises to personally deliver the good news to the prince. He further notes that this one fortunate shot may have just turned the tide of a campaign that had seemed lost.
{cps=50}Infiltrating the city hall will not be an easy task.{vspace=5}Relying on your experience, Bartholomew is letting you determine the best course of action...
{cps=50}Sadly, the trick doesn't work. As you approach the city hall, you run into a patrol, who immediately sees through your deception. You are forced to flee.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Items, Prestige - fail (required: 35)!{vspace=5}Fatigue increased!
{cps=50}Also, the bribery option is now off the table as it's now the middle of the night.
{cps=50}At the last minute, you decide you're not ready to leave yet.
{cps=50}The earl's a big dosser, that much is true. But he did kick the Scots' arses in that war in the North, didn't he, boss?{vspace=5}Even if that was luck, he can always get lucky again for all I know.
{cps=50}If the count's such a smart fella, why is he always playing second fiddle, boss?
{cps=50}And what about us, boss? We're coming with him as long as we're getting paid, right?
{cps=50}Is it Brittany next then, boss?
{cps=50}Looks like this knight is shit out of luck.
{cps=50}A dozen of voices burst into laughter.
{cps=50}They say the French king has brought the best knights from all over his kingdom under the walls of the city....
{cps=50}Well, well... It looks like we've pulled it off after all.
{cps=50}I guess I should thank you.
{cps=50}Well thank you then. I don't think I would've managed to do that without your help.
{cps=50}I'll be honest with you: my head still refuses to believe that we actually pulled it off.
{cps=50}But something tells me that I've already stolen her most valuable possession.
{cps=50}And she did the same to me.
{cps=50}I think it's best not to keep the lad in the city. Returning him to Jeanne would be complete folly after what we've pulled off. Canterbury's men will have the whole city turned upside down.
{cps=50}Neither he nor Jeanne can stay here any longer.
{cps=50}I am.
{cps=50}We're leaving Cambrai at dawn during the changing of the guard. There's a guy who's going to let us out. I've already set everything up.{w} And once we're out, then...{w} Then we'll see how it goes.
{cps=50}I love her.
{cps=50}Or so I think, at least.{w} I'm ready to take my chances.
{cps=50}I don't give a crap about this war anyway. I was only here for the gold and adventure.
{cps=50}When it comes to the latter we've already had quite enough for a lifetime. And when it comes to the gold...{w} I never thought that I of all people would say this... but there are more important things than gold.
{cps=50}Right?
{cps=50}So will I. Thanks for everything you did for me.
{cps=50}Oh, I almost forgot! This is for you. I wanted to hold onto this thing, but it would be far more useful to you than me.
{cps=50}Good luck, [name].{w} Maybe one day we'll see each other again.
{cps=50}The road to the Southern Farm — the closest of the three to the city — is undefended, and your party safely approaches it.
{cps=50}The battle is taking longer than expected. Enemy reinforcements may arrive at any moment.
{cps=50}With the battle dragging on for an eternity, the crowd gradually loses interest. The organizers are getting ready to stop the duel.
{cps=50}You decide to help out with the medicine shortage. You're promptly handed a list of the required medical supplies. {vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated - [st_lazarus.name!ti].
{cps=50}In addition, as a token of gratitude, the head of the hospital presents you with a gift in the form of a medical manuscript on the treatment of combat wounds.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Item received - [medical_book.name!ti].
{cps=50}Finding Farris turns out to be quite easy. The merchant confirms that he did in fact bring the jewelry ordered by Emma de Lusignan, but informs you that he will only hand it over after you pay him an additional 500 florins — the sum he lost paying off bandits on his way here.
{cps=50}You return to Damietta.
{cps=50}Such disrespect for dead fellow believers offends you, but you can't afford to waste time giving them a proper burial.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 15!
{cps=50}The duel is dragging on...
{cps=50}Your plan does not work; in the heat of battle, someone inflicts a fatal blow on Beibars, and he dies on the spot.
{cps=50}Your plan works. You swiftly neutralize the guards, incapacitate Beibars, and successfully make your getaway.
{cps=50}You're running out of time!
{cps=50}Armed with maps of the region, you leave Damietta, traverse past Faraskur, and soon plunge into the abyss that is the endless southern desert.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: 1

{cps=50}Aleanor... Forgive me.
{cps=50}That is my name.
{cps=50}My father...
{cps=50}I would love to go back... To a home I once had.
{cps=50}Before I destroyed it with my own hands.
{cps=50}I took the life of a man who was guilty of nothing other than having the courage to defend the honor of his sister.
{cps=50}I doomed an innocent girl to eternal suffering.
{cps=50}I besmirched my family's name.
{cps=50}I do not dare to go back.
{cps=50}Henri...
{cps=50}I have seen it all with my own eyes, brother.
{cps=50}It is true.{w} All of it.
{cps=50}I saw the burning bush on the hill.
{cps=50}I heard a voice that spoke to me.
{cps=50}I was healed from a deadly disease.
{cps=50}I saw the Lord bring down ten plagues on the heads of the unbelievers.
{cps=50}I saw the heretics and sinners burn in Gehenna's fiery inferno.
{cps=50}I praised His name and He gave me victories.
{cps=50}I shed my blood for Him and He healed my wounds.
{cps=50}All will be as it should be.
{cps=50}And you're a living proof of that.
{cps=50}I knew that I was destined to die on this field. And yet no matter how hard I chased Death, it still managed to escape me.
{cps=50}But now it all makes sense.
{cps=50}Tell my father and brother that I love them.
{cps=50}Tell Aleanor...
{cps=50}That I...
{cps=50}That I am sorry.
{cps=50}And that I shall die with her name on my lips.
{cps=50}Now... Please...
{cps=50}I understand, brother.{vspace=5}{w}But I will have to make you do it.
{cps=50}Your appearance does not inspire confidence in the guards, and you are not granted an audience with Count Caldwell or his daughter. You're not even allowed to enter the castle.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — fail (required: 40)!

{cps=50}Despite your desire to continue exploring the room, the attendant states that the time you've bought has expired and demands your immediate leave.
{cps=50}However, as you watch the poison in the sheriff's wound mingle with his blood, you realize that you're hardly in a position to complain about anything.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9} Virtue lowered by 30!

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}200 florins lost!{vspace=5}10 allied soldiers have joined your forces at Windsor!
{cps=50}The prospect of allying with bandits does not faze you. You accept them into your squad.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}15 allied soldiers have arrived at Windsor!{vspace=5}Prestige decreased by 1!
{cps=50}Despite your unsavory reputation, you rebuff their offer.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}However, as you take the floor, it becomes evident that mere grandstanding will not suffice in swaying your audience.
{cps=50}Despite the colossal size of the requested sum, your influence over the merchants is so great that they agree without hesitation.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige, Virtue - success!{vspace=5}10,000 florins received!
{cps=50}Your request is not approved by the merchants.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige, Virtue — fail!{vspace=5}Merchants' trust lowered by 30!
{cps=50}Although your request is quite bold, your influence over the merchants is so great that they agree without hesitation.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige, Virtue - success!{vspace=5}5,000 florins received!
{cps=50}After some consideration, the merchants agree.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige, Virtue - success!{vspace=5}3,000 florins received!
{cps=50}After some consideration, the merchants agree.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige, Virtue - success!{vspace=5}1,000 florins received!
{cps=50}Stop. Nobody gets past this point. Baron's orders.
{cps=50}Turn back while you still can.
{cps=50}I don't care who you are, you donkey. You're treading on the Baron of Colchester's land, and he has made it clear to you southerners that he doesn't want any of you here. Whether it's a knight or a peasant.
{cps=50}The late king, you say? What an irony. The old man was so blinded by the pursuit of glory and gold that he left us here to die, indifferent to our fate. Yet somehow he still ended up being the first to kick the bucket.
{cps=50}The king's men are not welcome here, boy. So, I say it for the second and last time: turn back while your head is still on your shoulders.
{cps=50}Say goodbye to your head.
{cps=50}The battle is dragging on too long. You are forced to retreat...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Baron of Colchester agrees to support you in the war!{vspace=5}A squad of 30 men has joined your forces!{vspace=5}Reputation (earl) increased by 15!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The Baron of Colchester agrees to support you in the war!{vspace=5}Reputation (earl) increased by 15!
{cps=50}Easy there, buddy. Don't panic.
{cps=50}My name is Jones.{w}{vspace=5}You can trust me.
{cps=50}Me and my... business associates keep law and order in these lands. And, to tell you the truth, we don't take too kindly to strangers.
{cps=50}So tell me: who are you and what the hell are you doing here?
{cps=50}Whoa, easy there, lad! Knights, princes, earls, and marquises...
{cps=50}I didn't desert from the royal army to tremble at the mere mention of hefty titles and big names. You might be the long-lost grandson of the Pope himself, for all I care. That still ain't gonna impress me.
{cps=50}As for the purpose of your visit, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you: the Marquis of Radcliffe, to the great regret of all those present, and myself personally, has left us.
{cps=50}He has departed for a better world.
{cps=50}Now there are no marquises here, so this land belongs to the free people of Chippenham...
{cps=50}...and their leader: Duncan, the Prince of Thieves.
{cps=50}He gets caught and executed somewhere almost every week. Old man Radcliffe caught him at least three times — hanged him twice and quartered him once.
{cps=50}Duncan personally severed one of the marquis's limbs for each of those three.
{cps=50}Do I need to specify which one of them is now lying in a grave?
{cps=50}You guessed it.
{cps=50}He's the one who's now calling the shots around here, so show some respect when you mention his name.
{cps=50}A business proposition, you say? Sounds very captivating...{w} Sounds like there might be money involved.
{cps=50}And when money is involved, a certain question appears...
{cps=50}...what's in it for us?
{cps=50}These are troubled times we live in, you see. Roads aren't safe. One can easily run into a gang of scoundrels and never make it to wherever they were going...
{cps=50}Yes, precisely. This is why my comrades and I would be happy to escort you to Chippenham and introduce you to Duncan. Make sure you get there safe and sound.
{cps=50}But any work must be paid.
{cps=50}How about... let's say... {w} 250 florins?
{cps=50}You are in no position to bargain, knight.
{cps=50}Either you pay us 250 florins and visit Duncan in Chippenham.{w}{vspace=5}Or you don't pay us a single dime. But then it's the old marquis whom you'll be visiting.{vspace=5}And there's no coming back from that journey.
{cps=50}Take what you can, give nothing back.
{cps=50}Alright.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}250 florins lost!
{cps=50}Hm-m-m... Well let's see...
{cps=50}That's a thick-ass chain you've got there on your neck...{w}{vspace=5}I think it'll suit me.
{cps=50}That's a nice gold cross you've got there on your neck...{w} I'm a religious man, too.{w}{vspace=5}I think it'll suit me.
{cps=50}That's a nice medallion you've got there on your neck...{w}{vspace=5}I think it'll suit me.
{cps=50}That's a nice ring you've got there on your finger...{w}{vspace=5}I think it'll suit me.
{cps=50}But what's there to think about? We always find a way to take what's ours.{w}{vspace=5}If not from the living, then from the dead.
{cps=50}Very good.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Item lost — [trinket_container.name!ti].
{cps=50}Not so fast, knight.
{cps=50}An audience with the late marquis is still quite possible. We'd be happy to send you there if you so desire.
{cps=50}But we don't thirst for blood, and you seem to be a rather well-off fellow.
{cps=50}So why don't we strike a deal?
{cps=50}Very good. We'll pretend we didn't see you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}250 florins lost!
{cps=50}Good. We'll pretend we didn't see you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Item lost — [trinket_container.name!ti].
{cps=50}Accompanied by Jones, you cross a lowered suspension bridge, pass the guards, and enter the main hall.
{cps=50}After crossing the lowered suspension bridge, you introduce yourself to the guards. Upon learning that you have business with Duncan, they let you through and escort you into the main hall.
{cps=50}Your vision darkens as you face your demise.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Men gathered under Windsor: [windsor_militiamen_gathered]{vspace=5}Men available in Chippenham: [chippenham_men_to_hire_left]{vspace=15}Florins: [player_gold]
{cps=50}You agree to pay the bloody price.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Arm injured!
{cps=50}You enter the city without any issue, but you find the gates of the duke's residence closed to you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige - fail (required: 50)!
{cps=50}To your surprise, the duke's guards appear to be anticipating a 'messenger from London'; upon informing them that you bear a letter from Prince Edward, you are promptly escorted to the duke...
{cps=50}I know who you are, [name]. You're quite the talk of the town these days.
{cps=50}You're of peasant stock, aren't you? Mudblood, yes...{w}{vspace=5}You've climbed rather high for a mere yokel, I have to admit.    
{cps=50}I don't hold your kind in too high of regard, but I do value hard work and courage. That I can respect.
{cps=50}Hate to break it to you, kid, but, unfortunately for you, you've bet on the wrong horse in this race.
{cps=50}I know. Didn't I just tell you that? I am perfectly aware of who you are and what you came here for.
{cps=50}And I know who sent you perfectly well.
{cps=50}That old devil Northampton wants to trick me again.{w}{vspace=5}He thinks I have forgotten everything.
{cps=50}He thinks he can insult me and then, when he requires my assistance, simply come and request it, pretending as if nothing occurred.
{cps=50}Thinks he can whistle and I'll come running to defend the worthless young prince whose father stabbed me in the back.
{cps=50}Ha.
{cps=50}You see...{w} I'll be honest with you; if Canterbury hangs the three of you, I'll be the first one to raise a pint to the new king. To justice being finally served.{w}{vspace=5}No offense, I'm just saying...
{cps=50}And you know what the funniest part is? I could actually help you. Seriously, I could.
{cps=50}Northampton even knows what he has to do in order to earn my forgiveness.{w} But something's telling me that he would rather die.
{cps=50}In any case, those are his problems. His and yours. When it comes to this war, I find myself perfectly satisfied with the role of an observer.
{cps=50}A letter, you say? Interesting.{w}{vspace=5}Alright. I'll give it a read.
{cps=50}Oddly enough I too have something in store for you.
{cps=50}Count Canterbury, who is now also actively currying my favor, knew that you would show up here sooner or later. He asked me to arrange you a 'proper meeting'.
{cps=50}Unlike him or Northampton, I still possess some sense of honor; I would never orchestrate an ambush at my own residence for my guests.
{cps=50}But, considering the current balance of power, denying a request from a man like Canterbury would be awfully inconsiderate on my part. Thus, a compromise was found. {w}One of your old friends just happened to {i}accidentally{/i} show up here at the same time as you.
{cps=50}Try not to break anything during the fight, alright?{w}{vspace=5}This is the residence of a duke — not a tavern full of puke.
{cps=50}Well, as they say here in Cambridge —{vspace=15}{i}It's going down{vspace=5}In C-town!
{cps=50}You cannot fathom how delightfully absurd the words in this letter are, my boy. Who would have imagined that the master schemer would end up as a helpless old man, reduced to begging for help?
{cps=50}And offer all of his land in exchange.
{cps=50}I'll be honest with you, lad. A mere couple of hours ago, I was absolutely convinced that if I were to enter this war, I would only do so on Canterbury's side.
{cps=50}Not out of any personal sympathy towards him, not at all. I consider him to be cut from the same cloth as your boss — as thirsty for power as Northampton is for wine.{vspace=5}My initial decision to side with Canterbury was purely pragmatic.
{cps=50}But this letter, in conjunction with the latest developments, can't help but change my perspective.
{cps=50}You've taken Windsor back despite Canterbury's best efforts.{vspace=5}And Northampton is finally willing to give me what I want.
{cps=50}Tell your boss that I am ready to accept his offer.{w} But on my own terms.
{cps=50}After our inevitable victory and his coronation, Prince Edward will have to break off his engagement to the Duchess of Aquitaine and instead take my youngest daughter as his wife.
{cps=50}As for Northampton, not only will he hand over all of his current holdings, but he will also provide me with a written promise to resign from all of his official posts and forever retire from the royal court. Never to return again.
{cps=50}He can have Canterbury's lands or some other rebels' holdings once they're defeated. But I want him gone.
{cps=50}These are my terms.{w}{vspace=5}Otherwise it's Canterbury's banner that my knights will fight under.
{cps=50}This is not the outcome I had in mind. But now Canterbury's insistence on a full-scale ambush does make much more sense...{w} But oh well — it is what it is.
{cps=50}As I've said, I have no inclination whatsoever to dance to Northampton's tune. But I'm willing to hear whatever message you were sent to deliver.{vspace=5}Where's that letter of yours...
{cps=50}But this letter, in conjunction with the latest developments...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}He gestures towards Roger's lifeless body, as it is being carried away by servants.
{cps=50}...has seriously altered my perspective regarding this conflict.
{cps=50}A storm is coming. This world is doomed.
{cps=50}It all will end soon.
{cps=50}Everything will happen as it must.
{cps=50}I've dreamed about this day many times.{vspace=5}{w}Now, it has finally come.
{cps=50}Leave me.
{cps=50}While you are eating, Lina does not miss the opportunity to ask about your visit to the mayor...
{cps=50}Abandoning allies to their fate is not in your nature. You attack the outpost.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}You decide not to risk it and head back.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue reduced by 15!
{cps=50}Enough bloodshed!{vspace=5}This war will last long enough for all of us to end up in Heaven.
{cps=50}I see that you're here to rescue the prisoners.{vspace=5}{w}How noble of you. You've earned my respect.
{cps=50}We are both knights, so let's settle this in the only way that befits us.{vspace=5}{w}One on one.
{cps=50}Very well.
{cps=50}But since we're up north, let's fight as the northerners do.{vspace=5}{w}No armor.
{cps=50}What is it? Scared?
{cps=50}It's not a skirt; it's a kilt!
{cps=50}I'll shorten that long tongue of yours, Englishman.{vspace=5}{w}Come on. Step forward. Just you and me.
{cps=50}Now I see who you really are, Englishman.{vspace=5}A dishonorable coward, accustomed to hiding behind the backs of his men.
{cps=50}If it's blood you want, then we'll give you blood.{vspace=5}This land will swallow you all.
{cps=50}What, you truly removed your armor? You're a brave one, Englishman!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}Do you seriously think that armor will save you, Englishman!?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue reduced by 15!
{cps=50}I'll chop you in half along with your iron shell!
{cps=50}You again, [player_title!ti]? How was your trip?
{cps=50}Have you made sure that everything is all right?
{cps=50}There is no need to overreact, [player_title!ti]. This is not London. This is the North. Restless and troubled lands.{vspace=5}Scottish raids are not a rare occasion here.
{cps=50}And I don't think that you do either, [player_title!ti].
{cps=50}I did not invite you here, nor did I solicit your advice or help.
{cps=50}This is my city, and you're here as a guest. So act as one.
{cps=50}If I tell you that there is nothing to worry about, then there is nothing to worry about.
{cps=50}We meet again. And again at a place where you don't have any business being.
{cps=50}And once again I don't remember anyone inviting you here.
{cps=50}These people are criminals, found guilty of heresy and idol-worshipping.{vspace=5}{w}They will be fairly tried and then executed.
{cps=50}Are you questioning the mayor's authority, [player_title!ti]?{vspace=5}{w}I suggest you watch your mouth.
{cps=50}And? If you need him, go search for him.
{cps=50}Are you deaf or something, [player_title!ti]? Let me tell you one more time: these people are dangerous criminals who have to be tried and executed.
{cps=50}Mayor's order.
{cps=50}I missed the part where that's my problem.
{cps=50}Is that so? Well, I'm glad you said that.
{cps=50}Tie him up, boys. And throw him in a cage with the rest of these animals.
{cps=50}It's a shame, [player_title!ti], but I'm afraid we will have to postpone this for another time.
{cps=50}You can have the peasants.{vspace=5}We'll find some new ones.
{cps=50}I'll be waiting.{vspace=5}But something tells me this is but another empty promise.
{cps=50}The world is sinking into the abyss right before your very eyes, [player_title!ti], but you are too blind to see past your own nose.
{cps=50}Next time we meet, I will kill you.
{cps=50}I give you my word.
{cps=50}Luckily, because the Scots have yet to completely surround the city, you're able to sneak past their lines and enter York unnoticed.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [birds_of_a_feather.name!ti].
{cps=50}You're younger than I thought!
{cps=50}When I was told that a royal negotiator had arrived from York, I thought I would be dealing with some old sly fox like Northampton or Canterbury.
{cps=50}When it comes to dealing with London's 'northern problems', it's usually one of them who gets to sort things out.
{cps=50}Is that so?{vspace=5}Well, war is indeed young men's business — old-timers don't belong on a battlefield. I was ready to prove this in practice, but they seem to have finally understood.
{cps=50}Regardless, I'm glad to see a new face.{vspace=5}{w}Tell me your name and your title.
{cps=50}Happy to make your acquaintance, [name].{vspace=5}{w}You, of course, know who I am, right?
{cps=50}My name is James Bruce, and I am the king of all Scots. From the River Esk in the south to the Orkney Islands in the north, there is not a single place where my name is not honored and my word is not followed.
{cps=50}Nonsense. Titles are needed to frighten the yokels and to restrain the servants who forget their place. On the battlefield, there is no difference between an earl and a marquis, or between a baron and a viscount. Neither there is one between a king and a common soldier.
{cps=50}In the moment of truth, we all are equal in the eyes of our Lord.
{cps=50}So let's put away the titles. You can call me James.{vspace=5}{w} What news are you bringing, [name]?
{cps=50}Do not know what caused this 'hostility', you say? The English king would know the cause if he paid proper attention to the actions of his subjects.
{cps=50}For many years now, people have been disappearing in our borderlands. At first, these were isolated cases: a hunter failing to return from the woods, a child losing their way in the weald, or a courier disappearing in the mountains.
{cps=50}However, in more recent times, entire families began to vanish without a trace.
{cps=50}When rumors of the horror in these lands reached Edinburgh, we were at a loss as to what to make of it. The evil persisted, as unpunished as it was elusive.
{cps=50}But eventually, these villains became so bold that they began openly attacking villages in broad daylight, snatching up innocents and locking them in cages like wild animals to take them to a place from which they'd never return.
{cps=50}Do you know what place I am talking about, [name]?
{cps=50}I am talking about this very city.
{cps=50}We've tracked down two parties of kidnappers. The first one managed to slip through our grasp.{vspace=5}The second one was intercepted by my men near the border.
{cps=50}One of the thugs was taken alive, [name]. On his very first day of torture, he confessed that the abductions were ordered by the mayor of York.
{cps=50}I don't think there is a need to explain what happened next.{vspace=5}If the English crown is not capable of keeping its subjects under control, then we will have to do it instead.
{cps=50}There are ten thousand men in this camp, [name]. Among them are lords whose lands were pillaged on the mayor's orders. Fathers whose children were kidnapped. Brothers whose sisters were taken away.
{cps=50}How do you think they will like this idea of yours? Do you think they will believe you?
{cps=50}A fair trial will indeed take place. But it's taking place tomorrow.
{cps=50}You're still young, [name]. Though if the king sent you here, I suppose that you are a smart man.
{cps=50}God is my witness — I don't want any blood. But you have to understand that it was your inaction that left me with no choice.
{cps=50}My subjects demand decisiveness from me, and I am not going to let them down.
{cps=50}Give me the mayor and all of his accomplices. Every single one of them.{vspace=5}{w}Then perhaps we can work out a deal.
{cps=50}You've got time, [name].{vspace=5}{w}Until tomorrow morning.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest updated — [birds_of_a_feather.name!ti].
{cps=50}Once again, showing up at places uninvited.
{cps=50}Didn't I warn you about what will happen when we meet again, [name]?
{cps=50}{b}You're too late for that.
{cps=50}Death is only the beginning.
{cps=50}We are at the gates of Hell, [name].{vspace=5}{w}And they are about to be opened.
{cps=50}You wouldn't understand.
{cps=50}Not all things can be explained rationally.{w} Especially under this shallow concept that you call {i}morality{/i}.
{cps=50}Blood for its own sake.{vspace=5}{w}Death for its own sake.{vspace=5}{w}Gold for its own sake.
{cps=50}Erasing city after city until this deformed abomination that you call civilization descends into the primordial darkness from whence it came.
{cps=50}There is something I can see too, [name]. I can see that you're wearing the exact same mask. Not of iron but of decency, rules, and norms of morality behind which you hide.
{cps=50}All in an attempt to conceal a primitive thirst for blood.{vspace=5}A desire to kill.
{cps=50}Death follows in your wake.{vspace=5}Oh we do enjoy this kind of company.
{cps=50}Death is only the beginning.{vspace=5}{w}Allow us to demonstrate.
{cps=50}Enough!{vspace=5}Stop killing my men.
{cps=50}I understand that we are at war, [name], but you cannot just slay my knights as if they were filthy yokels. This kind of tricks I might not forgive.
{cps=50}This was a daring raid. I'm impressed.
{cps=50}But if your intention was to kill me, then you should have come up with a better strategy.
{cps=50}Did you hear that? They say there's some unkillable berserk old fart throwing my soldiers off the wall, wreaking havoc. What the devil is going on there?
{cps=50}Don't get me wrong; those are some yokels, so I couldn't care less about them. But considering how many of my men are dying, it is beginning to look concerning.
{cps=50}Or maybe that's some kind of a sign. Fewer salaries to pay, too, I suppose...{vspace=5}At any rate, consider me convinced. We'll have a deal.
{cps=50}But.{vspace=5}{w}My previous offer was only valid until the beginning of the assault. You missed it, so the conditions will have to be revised.
{cps=50}We'll take all their bodies — that goes without saying. I'll hang them by the road as a reminder.
{cps=50}We will also be taking the city's treasury. Don't even start arguing — that is not up for discussion.
{cps=50}War is a costly business, and this campaign burned a sizeable hole in my pocket.{vspace=5}Someone will have to cover my expenses.
{cps=50}Furthermore, you will cede control over all your northern outposts. My men already hold about half of them anyway.
{cps=50}Be philosophical about it, [name]. There is no black and white in politics. There is only the lesser evil and the common good.
{cps=50}And ambition, of course. But that is a whole other story.
{cps=50}You've been sent here to save the city, and save the city you did. You even managed not to lose your own life in the process. This is quite an achievement.
{cps=50}And about the city treasury — pffft...{vspace=5}Tell them the mayor embezzled it.
{cps=50}Because it looks just like you!
{cps=50}But what happened in Conques? The surviving residents spoke of a band of English cutthroats.
{cps=50}I believe you. I pray that retribution befalls those damn marauders.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) improved by 5!
{cps=50}I didn't think you'd have the courage to appear before me after everything your people have done in my lands.
{cps=50}It seems that, despite all your stories about how it was the kings who started this war and that ordinary soldiers do not thirst for blood, it's evident that some of them clearly do. They also revel in the misery of others.
{cps=50}Conques, Barfleur, Fer-a-Cheval — the villages my family has owned for decades are now pillaged and burned to the ground by cruel bandits.
{cps=50}One of whom, I suppose, is now standing right before my very eyes.
{cps=50}You promised to avoid spilling the blood of innocents. Now I see how little your words are worth...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) lowered by 25!
{cps=50}Well, I'm not even sure how am I supposed to greet you — as a hero or as a villain?
{cps=50}One morning I'm told that you spared the people of one of my villages, but in the evening of the same day you and your gang of cutthroats pillaged another.
{cps=50}What am I supposed to think of all of this?
{cps=50}...orders that demand killing innocent people?
{cps=50}You can hide behind big words like 'loyalty' and 'orders' as much as you want, but that won't change the essence of your actions. I hope that deep down you understand that.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}Well, at least you've got the courage to admit what you've done.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Did you really?
{cps=50}You are a horrible liar. I can tell by the look on your face that you're not telling the truth.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue check failed!
{cps=50}The only thing that disgusts me more than broken promises is a blatant lie told in an attempt to cover up one's despicable actions.
{cps=50}You've told me so much about your honor... But now I see your true face.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) lowered by 25!
{cps=50}And how did that work out?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue check passed!
{cps=50}I believe you. I will pray for retribution to befall those damn marauders.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Eva) improved by 5!
{cps=50}As for you, let God be your judge.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 7!
{cps=50}You again? Well hello there. Is it me you're coming to visit, or are you on another 'very important mission'?
{cps=50}You again? I can't believe my guards didn't shoot you on sight.{vspace=5}Someone's getting demoted, that's for sure...
{cps=50}How's that siege of yours progressing? I heard that the recent assault turned out to be a failure... What a shame.
{cps=50}When my father arrives here with the French army...
{cps=50}...I'll ask him to take it easy on you.
{cps=50}Take a stroll through our market square on the way back, maybe you will find something useful to buy. Help out the locals with some extra coins.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [benefactor.name]!
{cps=50}What am I supposed to think about all this?
{cps=50}As for me, there is no need to worry. I do not have any ulterior motives or secret plans.
{cps=50}Oh, just wait until you get to know me better. I don't bite, and I'm completely harmless.
{cps=50}A lethal combat poison with a strong debilitating effect. The only one of its kind, highly experimental.
{cps=50}And it's you who gets to test it in battle.{vspace=5}{w}I'm sure you'll be impressed.
{cps=50}You did miss me too, didn't you?
{cps=50}De Montfort, who was totally infatuated with her, was ready to turn a blind eye to any and all of her mischievous deeds. But the duke's entourage, both the inner circle and the local nobility, found the idea of bathing in the blood of virgins and decorating rooms with skulls to be a bit excessive.
{cps=50}I heard that your raid went rather well.{vspace=5}Good job!
{cps=50}See? It's always great when interests align.
{cps=50}We've only just met, but I already love doing business with you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Anna) improved by 20!
{cps=50}Here's the deal. Help me sort it out, and I will gladly answer any and all of your questions.
{cps=50}Bring it to me, and I won't leave a single question of yours unanswered.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [woods_and_goddess.name!ti]!
{cps=50}As one of my associates used to say:{vspace=5}{i}You want the goodies?{vspace=5}Welcome to the goodie room!
{cps=50}I trade with those who are at my doorstep. As long as it is your men who occupy the surrounding areas, my business with Onar and Ruffin is... temporarily on hold.
{cps=50}And I am in active search of new clients.
{cps=50}A lot.{vspace=5}Ruffin proved suprisingly knowledgeable about potions. As soon as he saw what my concoctions were capable of, he immediately started buying them in bulk for his men.
{cps=50}I've heard they even maintain an entire warehouse to store them.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}An entire warehouse...
{cps=50}Chances are that they would be really angry if something happened to it...{vspace=5}{w}Listen, I'm starting to think that we can seriously help each other here.
{cps=50}My intuition tells me of your victory over the rebels sooner than later.
{cps=50}I doubt that Ruffin and his men would be able to burn through everything I've supplied them with. This means that the warehouse might soon swap owners or even end up pillaged by the locals.
{cps=50}And that would be a lot of lost profits!
{cps=50}Nothing too complicated. I tell you the location of the warehouse, and you burn it down to the ground. Along with everything inside it.
{cps=50}Rebels lose their supplies, which benefits you.{vspace=5}Meanwhile, I can artificially maintain a deficit on the market — or prevent its oversaturation, if you will.{vspace=5}{w}Everyone wins.
{cps=50}Joffrey turns out to be an elderly man, fulfilling the duties of a herald for over three decades now.
{cps=50}Thanks to the sergeant's help, you get in touch with the smugglers, who, as it turns out, were just about to flee the city themselves.

{cps=50}Ha! What a smartass! I would gladly pay for a job well done from my own pocket. It's a shame there's no one around who can actually do that.
{cps=50}Let's make a deal: you do three shifts at the forge to help me out, and I'll take a look at your junk.
{cps=50}I'll pay you for every shift too. If your hands aren't actually growing out of your ass, you might even earn some decent coin.
{cps=50}I told you: do something for me first, and I'll consider doing something for you.
{cps=50}Nice job. Thanks for the help.
{cps=50}See? Job's easy and money's good. Piece of cake.
{cps=50}Come visit me again if you've got nothing to do. There's always work to be done.
{cps=50}Yeah, I almost forgot.
{cps=50}Alright, give it here, your junk... But money first!
{cps=50}These are horrible times we live in — ain't a soul around you can trust. Especially when it comes to scrawny ragamuffins like you!
{cps=50}Is that so? Well, Hoggard's not a ragamuffin either, and yet he still refused to pay!
{cps=50}About two weeks back, that drunkard parody of a knight commissioned me to get him a chest — 'for spoils and trophies'.
{cps=50}Since then, he's been constantly pushing me to get it done faster. Even tried giving me — ME — advice!
{cps=50}And guess what!? Finally I get the damn thing done, a-a-a-and... Fella refuses to pay!
{cps=50}And to top it all off, now he's bloody dead...{w} Damn him to hell...
{cps=50}We settled on 60 Florins, but given the circumstances, I'd happily part with it for even half that amount.
{cps=50}Well, someone better.{w} 'Cause I haven't got a bloody clue what to do with it...
{cps=50}I've always got work.{w}{vspace=5}As long as you're not a clumsy dork.
{cps=50}Do you know what all clumsy dorks have in common?{w}{vspace=5}They all believe that they're not.
{cps=50}That work was a piece of cake. Anyone can do that. If you want to earn some proper cash, you've got to step up your game, son.
{cps=50}Start using not only the hands but also that tiny head of yours.{vspace=5}Which proves to be too hard for some people.
{cps=50}If you're not up for some real work, then head to the forge and run some errands.{vspace=5}But if you're ready, let me know. There's some real money to be made.
{cps=50}I like your confidence. Well then, listen here...
{cps=50}I've got a highly specific order. The customer wants a combined armor — a leather jacket with chainmail overlay. He wants it to be sturdy, too: torso armor no lower than 10, and torso cover no lower than 90.
{cps=50}Limbs also should be well protected. Limbs armor no lower than 6, and limbs cover no lower than 30.
{cps=50}Finally, it has to look nice: 7 or more Prestige.
{cps=50}If you can craft one, I'll buy it from you for whatever it's worth plus an additional 70 florins as compensation for your efforts.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [armorer.name!ti].
{cps=50}Well, let's examine the fruits of your genius...
{cps=50}No, this is not what I asked for. You definitely got something wrong.
{cps=50}Great. Everything looks to be in order.
{cps=50}Here's the reward. All as promised.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[trait] florins received!
{cps=50}I have to admit — you're kind of good at this. It's always nice to work with people who know their stuff. Hit me up if you want some more work.
{cps=50}By the way, I've got some interesting stuff on my hands at times — usually leftovers from unfulfilled orders. Come take a look — perhaps there might be something to your liking.
{cps=50}You're just in time. A good friend of mine asked for a favor, but I'm awfully busy.
{cps=50}Here's the situation. The lad just got married — like a week before the campaign began. So he'd really prefer to return home to his young bride not only alive but also with his face intact.
{cps=50}He was doing well until a couple of days ago when that fool lost his helmet while crossing a river. Now if he sees any kind of serious action, he might end up royally screwed.
{cps=50}As you might guess, the helmet he lost was not your average steel cap, so replacing it is not exactly a five-minute affair. That's why he asked for my help...
{cps=50}A couple of well-placed scars might indeed add a bit of manly charm to a soldier's face, yes. But two fleshy holes instead of a nose probably won't.{vspace=5}{w}Unless it is your face that we're talking about, of course.
{cps=50}And don't even get me started on the eyes. Imagine returning home to your wife blind, never being able to see her again.
{cps=50}Not that there's much to look at in his case...
{cps=50}I've seen his girl, and...{vspace=5}{w}She's a bit of a plain Jane to be honest.
{cps=50}But her face is pretty cute. I'll give her that.
{cps=50}Whatever. So here's what we need: a helmet with a minimum of 14 armor and high coverage. Let's say... not lower than 70.
{cps=50}Everything else doesn't really matter. It's not like he's going to be parading before the king in that bloody thing.
{cps=50}Our deal is the same: I'll pay you whatever it's worth plus 70 on top.
{cps=50}Just don't take too much time with it. It's kind of urgent, right?{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [saving_face.name!ti].
{cps=50}Great. Very nice job.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[trait] florins received!
{cps=50}You arrive at the governor's office, hoping for news about Renauld. However, the governor informs you that his men are still examining the documents.
{cps=50}You inquire with the governor about any updates concerning Renauld, but he informs that his search is still in progress...
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You've got nothing to talk about with the governor...
{cps=50}Impressed by your reputation, Vettori agrees to help.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige, Reputation (soldiers) — success!
{cps=50}According to the Italian, making such a shot with an ordinary crossbow would be problematic. One would need to be inventive.
{cps=50}Because of your bad reputation, Vettori is distrustful of you and acquiesces to your request half-heartedly.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige, Reputation (soldiers) — failure!
{cps=50}Of course not! There's all kinds of stuff in here — pick whatever you want.
{cps=50}You got the stuff? I need some clothes and a ring or a chain, remember?
{cps=50}I still need the clothes, remember?
{cps=50}I still need a chain or a ring, remember?
{cps=50}What the hell is this thing? A contract?
{cps=50}Jo-na-than... Cal-ver-ly... From Ox... Oxford.
{cps=50}Accompanied by five men-at-arms... Is accepted into the royal service for the whole duration of the campaign...
{cps=50}With a monthly allowance of...
{cps=50}This is one lucky find, brother! I doubt that the late Sir Calverly has any interest in this handsome sum. We, on the other hand, certainly wouldn't mind pocketing some extra florins. Am I right?
{cps=50}Why the hell not? Dead men don't need money, I'm telling you. Quite the contrary! They say in church that the Lord favors the poor. Therefore, while our knight is waiting in Purgatory, we'll help him 'relieve' of all his unnecessary monetary assets! He'll be clean before the Great Judge!
{cps=50}Gold weighs heavy, brother. A pouch full of florins might drag a dead man from Heavens all the way down to Earth. In a way, it is our honorable duty as Christians to help a man who cannot help himself.
{cps=50}No need to overthink it. You'll just go to the treasurer and pretend to be one of Sir Calverly's servants. Like an armor bearer or something.
{cps=50}We have the contract, and you have the word 'servant' pretty much written all over your face. There really shouldn't be any issues...{w} You just have to dress up a bit.
{cps=50}Just enough to make a proper impression.
{cps=50}If you go there with a rope around your trousers instead of a belt, or with a wooden club instead of a sword, chances are you won't pass as a member of a knight's entourage. So, y'know, dress accordingly.
{cps=50}Let me know when you're ready. I'll take you to the treasurer.
{cps=50}Well, you certainly have conscience in plentiful supply. Shame it's no use when your pockets are empty and your stomach's growling.
{cps=50}An interesting take. I can respect that.{w} Even though you're pretty bloody wrong.
{cps=50}You ready? Good.
{cps=50}Remember: act cool and look confident...
{cps=50}Bartholomew takes you to the treasurer...
{cps=50}She is.
{cps=50}The last guy who said it was all stolen,{vspace=5}Left here with his eye swollen.
{cps=50}You know what to do. Just don't delay too much or we'll miss our chance.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [accomplice.name!t]!
{cps=50}She won't even glance at me as long as I look like a grubby footsoldier. I need to, y'know, dress up.
{cps=50}Relax, brother. All I'm asking for is some clean and nice-looking clothes.
{cps=50}A pair of fancy shoes, perhaps. An elegant belt or an ornate cloak. Hell, I'd even settle for a hat with a feather.
{cps=50}See? Piece of cake.
{cps=50}Almost forgot. I'll also need some bling.
{cps=50}Christ almighty. Some bling! Like maybe a ring or a chain or something.
{cps=50}Very funny, mate.{w}{vspace=5}You know what I mean.
{cps=50}You won't let me down, right?
{cps=50}Yeah, something's up.
{cps=50}You remember the bird I 'visited' not so long ago?
{cps=50}Hey! Watch your mouth, brother.
{cps=50}I didn't rob her.{w}{vspace=5}...{w}{vspace=5}Even if I did steal, it was from her father, not directly from her.
{cps=50}And now it's looking like Fate itself wants me to pay them back.
{cps=50}..?
{cps=50}I visited Jeanne this morning... That girl, I mean.
{cps=50}It's not the sort of thing I usually do...{w} But this time, something felt different. I felt like I had to see her.
{cps=50}She was all teary-eyed and crying. Hysterical almost.
{cps=50}At first, I thought I had something to do with it, but it was actually about her father.
{cps=50}He was arrested last night by Count Canterbury's men.{vspace=5}They believe him to be a French spy.
{cps=50}H-m-m-m... Well, considering that we already have experience breaking people out of prison...
{cps=50}...perhaps we can do that again?
{cps=50}{b}I{/b} have experience breaking into prisons and freeing people from them, yes.{w} {b}You{/b} have experience getting locked up and waiting for someone to get you out.
{cps=50}You can phrase it however you want. I've already promised her that I'll help.
{cps=50}Your help and experience would be appreciated, but if you've got more pressing matters to attend to, then it's fine.{w} I can do it all myself.
{cps=50}Canterbury's men have taken control of Cambrai's city hall. Jeanne mentioned that the city watch typically detains prisoners in the catacombs beneath the building.
{cps=50}Fear takes molehills for mountains. This shouldn't be any more difficult than the stunt you've pulled off in Dunkirk.
{cps=50}Especially considering that the entire city is in total disarray. We can easily dart in and out under the cover of darkness.

{cps=50}Whatever you say.
{cps=50}I've been seeing this pretty fat pigeon flying around for the past few days.
{cps=50}I wonder where it came from...
{cps=50}The boys say that they've seen wolves, bandits, and all kinds of suspicious ragamuffins in the woods.
{cps=50}I know you're the type of guy who likes wandering around, so keep your eyes peeled.
{cps=50}Of course not. What kind of news do you even expect? Every day is the same...
{cps=50}I saw a rather plump crow a couple of days back.
{cps=50}As big as a piglet — I'm not kidding!
{cps=50}I've already made a deal with that Italian crossbowman fellow. If it shows up here again, we'll shoot it down and roast it!
{cps=50}So keep your eyes open, alright?
{cps=50}They say that there are lots of hot girls in Cambrai...
{cps=50}Hopefully I won't stain my gear with blood and dirt during the next assault.
{cps=50}This is not a trifling matter, pal.
{cps=50}If you are starting to get sick of spending the nights in the embrace of your shield, then I suggest you start planning ahead.{vspace=5}{w}I bet you don't even know how to properly approach a girl.
{cps=50}Me? I've got that natural charm. Lasses give it to me nice and easy.
{cps=50}But you, my friend, should definitely work on yourself.{vspace=5}Like, I don't know, learn some romantic song or how to do a trick.
{cps=50}You're buddies with the earl, aren't you? He looks like a ladies man. Perhaps he could teach you a thing or two.
{cps=50}I met a fortune teller here the other day.
{cps=50}Said I could live a long and happy life.
{cps=50}If I steer clear of wars, adventures, and mysterious women, that is.
{cps=50}But how's that a happy life?{w} I think she could've been a charlatan...
{cps=50}A friend of mine convinced me to buy a pair of new shoes from him.
{cps=50}And guess what?{vspace=5}{w}Turns out they were stolen!
{cps=50}A tale old as time: placing trust in someone only to find yourself in trouble.
{cps=50}Take a bigger bag with you — you'll need it, ha-ha!
{cps=50}So what? You're happy now?
{cps=50}Hey, don't be like that, friend.{vspace=5}I'm just trying to look after you.
{cps=50}There will be a day when I'm no longer around, and you'll suddenly realize how much I was doing for you.

{cps=50}Well, as you might have guessed, I am also here at the invitation of Bernard de Chatillon. He probably told you about what happened to his youngest son.
{cps=50}Yes. He mentioned that the situation is dire.
{cps=50}I would like to say that this is not so, but there really are few prospects.
{cps=50}We tried all imaginable and inconceivable methods of treatment, but, as you can see, we did not achieve success. So now we, for the most part, are looking for a way to somehow alleviate Henri's suffering rather than cure him.
{cps=50}There is hope - albeit tiny - that over time the disease may recede on its own. Such cases are known, although extremely rare.
{cps=50}But if a miracle doesn’t happen, then... The poor guy's not going to make it.
{cps=50}Yeah. Apparently, the atmosphere here is not the most cheerful.
{cps=50}Oh, don't even mention it. At first, when I just arrived here, Henri’s treatment was carried out by a small group of reputable doctors - real professionals, including several maestros, from whose books I myself once studied.
{cps=50}But, as time passed, and Henri got worse, Bernard began to gradually lose faith in real medicine and increasingly seek help from...
{cps=50}Hell, how can I put it mildly...{w}Outright charlatans!
{cps=50}Dubious healers, semi-literate herbalists, idiotic bloodletters - and now rogue alchemists!
{cps=50}It is not surprising that with such doctors even a perfectly healthy person can easily kick the bucket - let alone someone who is already barely clinging to life!
{cps=50}But, what’s even worse, all this rabble, willing to kill for a couple of extra florins, immediately quarreled among themselves, turning the rescue of poor Henri into some kind of perverted competition, where the main task is not to aid the sick but to gain the trust of Seigneur de Chatillon...
{cps=50}...while making sure that all of your 'colleagues' fall out of his favor.
{cps=50}They eavesdrop and spy on each other in an attempt to appropriate any valuable idea, and any carelessly spoken word is immediately reported to Bernard.
{cps=50}Sounds like a total nightmare.
{cps=50}Exactly! It feels like I'm in some kind of jar with spiders and I'm not sure I have the strength to stay here for long.
{cps=50}The only thing that still keeps me here is my promise to Bernard that I will make a potion that will help alleviate Henri’s suffering.
{cps=50}In a couple of days I’m sailing to Outremer, but if during this time I can help you with anything, just tell me.
{cps=50}I am at your service.
{cps=50}I've missed your gallantry, [name].
{cps=50}But I'm afraid there's not much to help with here - the potion requires saffron, and that's a damn rare thing.
{cps=50}Bernard tried, at my request, to buy a pinch from the Avignon city pharmacist, but this greedy scoundrel named a sum that was completely ruinous even for de Chatillon.
{cps=50}As I understood, once upon a time Bernard stole several profitable transactions from under his nose, so now the pharmacist is trying to get even with him.
{cps=50}Anyway, we ended up having to order saffron all the way from Italy, so now all we can do is just wait for it to finally arrive.
{cps=50}They promised to deliver it in the second half of next month.
{cps=50}Why are you looking at me like that?
{cps=50}I'm no trade expert, but if the closest place to get this saffron of yours is Avignon, then why don't we get it in Avignon?
{cps=50}But the pharmacist...
{cps=50}I'll take care of the pharmacist. If he is not interested in gold, then I will offer him some steel.
{cps=50}No blood! The last thing de Chatillon needs is a repeat of the Renauld story.
{cps=50}We're not in the fields under Cambrai here - I understand that you are a man of the sword, but I don’t need the services of a brigand.
{cps=50}I am ready to let you resolve this issue... using non-standard methods, but only on the condition that none of the residents of Avignon go to the other world in the process.
{cps=50}Great. Then listen...
{cps=50}I can't promise that.
{cps=50}Then we await the delivery from Italy.
{cps=50}But...
{cps=50}And no objections.
{cps=50}I was glad to see you, [name]. I hope that you return safely from your journey.
{cps=50}Farewell.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 15!
{cps=50}Don’t consider my words tactless, but if Henri is already on the verge of death, and every new day brings him only more and more suffering without any prospect of recovery, then why prolong his torment?
{cps=50}Wouldn't it be more humane...?
{cps=50}What wouldn't be more humane?
{cps=50}Killing him?
{cps=50}Damn it, what's wrong with you all!?
{cps=50}Who gives you the right to so simply decide the fate of a person in trouble who needs help and sympathy more than ever?
{cps=50}It's not what I...
{cps=50}No need. Do not say anything. {w}{vspace=5}I've heard enough.
{cps=50}I have a lot to do and no time to chat.
{cps=50}Farewell.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cecilia) lowered by 50!
{cps=50}Hello, [name]. I told you we would meet again.
{cps=50}How are things in Rennes?
{cps=50}What an amazing story. It’s even a little sad that I left there at the most interesting moment. {w}I missed all the fun.
{cps=50}However, this is not so important.
{cps=50}To tell the truth, I’m not going to linger too long here either - I, like many other doctors and alchemists, was attracted by the generous offer of Bernard de Chatillon, but, by the Gods, healing his son is beyond my power.
{cps=50}So, I'm not going to profit from his grief by spending months inventing new methods of treatment.
{cps=50}But, although I cannot cure Henri, I can still do something for him.
{cps=50}I suspect that you heard my conversation with that redhead beauty pretending to be a good doctor, so I won’t repeat the same thing.
{cps=50}The guy is as good as dead, and the only way to end his suffering is to end his life.
{cps=50}His father is too weak to accept this reality, and the cohort of doctors he assembled receives hefty purses of florins every month for treating Henri. So none of them will dare to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.
{cps=50}I heard why you are here. I understand that it is also not for the sake of altruism, but if we don’t help him - no one will.
{cps=50}Tell me what needs to be done.
{cps=50}I didn’t doubt you for a second.
{cps=50}I have already prepared a potion - a painless poison that will make the poor fellow fall asleep forever.
{cps=50}The problem is that all the medicines and potions that are given to Henri first go through one of Bernard's court doctors, who makes sure that the patient does not get worse.
{cps=50}I hoped that the redhead would somehow help me solve this problem since she is in particularly good standing here, but this option, as you can see, did not work.
{cps=50}So that leaves us with the good old stealthy infiltration. Henri's chambers are guarded, but judging by what you showed in Rennes, this shouldn't be much of an obstacle for you.
{cps=50}It would be best to do this on the eve of your sailing to Outremer, so that you do not fall under suspicion.
{cps=50}By the way, regarding Outremer, I wouldn’t advise you to go there, but I think it would be fair to Bernard. If we take one son away from him, we must at least try to get the other one back.
{cps=50}We? What are you implying?
{cps=50}Well, it's certainly not like I'm going with you. {w}I can't stand the heat well.
{cps=50}Too bad. I could use some good company.
{cps=50}Well then, come back from there in one piece.
{cps=50}They say that God loves a trinity. Our third meeting may well turn out to be something more than the first two.
{cps=50}I understand your desire to put him out of his misery, but that decision is not yours to make.
{cps=50}You can't kill him just because you feel sorry for him or because you don't think he can be cured.
{cps=50}You don't...
{cps=50}Don't continue. That's enough. {w}It looks like I overestimated you after all.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Anna) lowered by 50!
{cps=50}Well, when we parted in Rennes, I promised that we would meet again - and we did.
{cps=50}Now it’s time to part again. {w}This time for good.
{cps=50}Good luck, [name]. {w}Now go run after the redhead girl, maybe you’ll catch up with her in time.
{cps=50}This time a stocky fellow appears before you, dressed in nothing less of a full plate armor and with a huge two-handed hammer at the ready.
{cps=50}Thank God you're still here! {w}I kind of lost my way in the woods and was afraid I was going to miss you.
{cps=50}Hardly my fault, honestly. I'm not even remotely from around here, you see.{w} I'm Leon from the city of Lyon.
{cps=50}We're with a company here, me and my brother. Getting some stuff done for the local landowners.
{cps=50}There hasn't been that much work lately, to be frank, so...{w} Gotta make some coin on the side, y'know.
{cps=50}By the way, it's a goddamn scorcher out here today. Christ!
{cps=50}You don't have a sip of water, do you, friend?
{cps=50}Good Heavens! Thanks a lot!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Item lost — Canteen!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}Good Heavens! Thanks a lot, brother!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Item lost — Waterskin!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}So yeah... What was I saying?{w} Oh yes.{w} The bag.{w} Hand it over.
{cps=50}And also that alchemical s-thingy. Goddamit, what's its name?{w} Oh yeah, saffron, right? I'll need that too, if you don't mind.
{cps=50}That's quite a long list. The bag, the saffron... Perhaps you would also like some florins out of my pocket too?
{cps=50}Well, if you've got any, then I definitely wouldn't mind grabbing them for myself.
{cps=50}In other words...{w}{vspace=5}I'll take everything, thanks.
{cps=50}Listen, pal, how about we make a deal?
{cps=50}Can we strike a deal, you ask?{w}{vspace=5}Well, we most certainly can.
{cps=50}There's only one little problem.{w}{vspace=5}I'm kind of a tough customer when it comes to negotiations.
{cps=50}You see...{w} When all you've got is a hammer — everything starts looking like a nail.
{cps=50}And all I've got is a hammer...
{cps=50}No deal then?
{cps=50}No, Mr. Talking Nail.{vspace=5}No deal.

{cps=50}Thus, a veteran of two wars, dragged into one of them against his will and into the other from under the executioner's axe, turns into a prosperous merchant and a decent family man.
{cps=50}Thus, a veteran of two wars, dragged into one of them against his will and into the other by boredom, turns into a prosperous merchant and a decent family man.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 16 of 19.
{cps=50}An unpleasant surprise in the form of two uninvited guests who somehow got inside the house and, without any secrecy, settled right at the dining table.
{cps=50}Put the weapon down, lad. If we wanted to kill you, you'd be dead by now.
{cps=50}And look how deftly he grabbed his axe, huh? What a rascal!
{cps=50}You can instantly tell he's a seasoned soldier. Duncan was right, of course — any real soldier is worth a dozen peasants.
{cps=50}Who are you? And what the hell are you doing in my house?!
{cps=50}Calm down, friend. My name is Jones. And you can trust me.
{cps=50}This is my friend Rodolfo, and we are here to make you an extremely advantageous offer.
{cps=50}So spare us a few minutes.
{cps=50}Tell me what you came with and then get out of my house.
{cps=50}Straight to business, huh? I like that.
{cps=50}So, listen up. As far as I understand, you've returned to these parts just recently, so it's worth bringing you up to speed a little...
{cps=50}Tell him what's what, Rodolfo.
{cps=50}The common people have lived for centuries under the heel of kings and lords who, like ghouls, sucked the blood of simple laborers such as you and me.
{cps=50}Realizing their impunity, they skin three hides off anyone their clawed paws can reach. They take the last from the people...
{cps=50}The unfortunate villagers are forced to work hard in the fields of the feudal lords, leaving their own families hungry.
{cps=50}Anyone who wants to get their own piece of land has to pay an exorbitant rent, which will bankrupt you long before you can earn even a florin from the rented plot.
{cps=50}There are ruinous taxes on everything. Do you want to hunt in the lord's forest? Go fishing in his lake, or even, hell, drive a cart on the road that runs through his property? Pay! Pay for everything and pay always!
{cps=50}Pay until you give it all, to the last florin.
{cps=50}And when you've given the last of it away, go straight into the jaws of the loan sharks who will intoxicate you with sweet talk and then slip a credit garrote around your neck.
{cps=50}If you take a florin from them, you'll return them ten. And if you can't, you'll hand them first the mare and the cart, and then the house.
{cps=50}Your family will be thrown out on the street in front of you. Your wife will be turned into a whore and your children into beggars. And you will be put in a pit to be eaten by worms.
{cps=50}This is the life the king and his barons offer us. All of us.
{cps=50}Including you personally.
{cps=50}We've made inquiries about you, lad. You seem to have just arrived here, yet your name has already appeared in the ledgers of the local moneylender guild.
{cps=50}And there's an amount written in red ink next to it. And it's not a small amount.
And there's an amount written in red ink next to it. It's not much yet. But there's more to come.
{cps=50}We offer you a way out.{w}{vspace=5}Duncan offers you a way out.
{cps=50}And who exactly is this Duncan?
{cps=50}Duncan is the man who knows what to do.
{cps=50}No one knows where he came from. It doesn't really matter. A few months ago, he rebelled against the old Count Caldwell and his ghoul daughter.
{cps=50}He fights against exorbitant taxes, against dishonorable laws, against the bondage into which the honest working man is forced by the gold-clad greasy barons.
{cps=50}Well, judging by the fact that you have to personally go and negotiate with every potential supporter, things must not be going well for the rebellion. Am I right?
{cps=50}No, you are not. Duncan has hundreds, thousands of supporters. You can't fool people - they see who he is, they see what he's willing to do for them, and they return the favor.
{cps=50}Then what do you need me for?
{cps=50}Hard workers respect and love Duncan - they are ready to hide him in their basements from the guards, to give him the last piece of bread or a shirt. But not many people are ready to go into the field against the armored cavalry.
{cps=50}And among those who would dare to make a stand, God willing, only a half would know which end of the spear to point at the enemy.
{cps=50}Peasants are not warriors.{vspace=5}{w}Unlike you and me.
{cps=50}I participated in the campaign against the Welsh rebels, Jones fought in Scotland many years ago. But Duncan doesn't have many people like us yet.
{cps=50}It doesn't take much for guerrilla warfare in the forests or robberies of the rich on the roads, followed by the distribution of their goods to the underprivileged. But that's not what Duncan wants to do.
{cps=50}He wants to end tyranny. And that requires real soldiers who have experience in real wars.
{cps=50}We offer you to take up arms again, but this time for a just cause. Not for lands and titles for earls and princes, but for the future of your own children.
{cps=50}If you agree, your problems with the moneylenders will be solved today, and your family will always have some food on the table. I'll see to it personally.
{cps=50}I'm intrigued.
{cps=50}If this Duncan is at least half as good as you describe him, he's clearly someone you can risk your life for.
{cps=50}I'm ready to join you.
{cps=50}I'm glad to hear that. We are on the verge of great things, my friend.
{cps=50}Gather your things and get ready. I'll send people for you when the time comes.
{cps=50}If there's one thing I've learned during my time in the royal army, it's that the sweeter the speeches you hear, the stinkier the shit you're offered to dive into.
{cps=50}Give Duncan my best regards.
{cps=50}Well, when the loan sharks come to your house in a couple of months to take everything of value from you and throw you out on the street, remember this conversation.
{cps=50}I'm intrigued, but I need to think about it.
{cps=50}We're willing to give you some time.
{cps=50}But remember, by the time the loan sharks send their enforcers to take everything of value from you and escort you to your date with the executioner, it will be too late to call Duncan for help.
{cps=50}Once out of town, you take a short break on a hill — just in time to enjoy the sight of the flaming building of the Maidstone moneylender guild.
{cps=50}The old count, as well as his young sadistic daughter, are well known throughout the area for their cruelty both to the rebels, whom they eradicate without pity, and to their own peasants, whom they hold in a tight grip and force to pay through the nose.
{cps=50}The next morning you, with a group of about a dozen well-armed rebels, ambush a road at the edge of the forest...
{cps=50}The wounded and exhausted knight slumps to the ground, dropping an ornate sword from his hands and submitting his head to the killing blow.
{cps=50}Take a good look at him, [name]. This is who we're dealing with.
{cps=50}All these creatures can do is slaughter unarmed and defenseless peasants. As soon as they are confronted by someone capable of fighting back, their entire feigned formidability crumbles like a sand castle.
{cps=50}Nice bling! How did you get it, pal? By beating the last florins out of debtors, eh?
{cps=50}Or maybe old man Caldwell gave it to you - to his chain dog for faithful service?
{cps=50}It's a gift. From Count Canterbury.
{cps=50}For bravery.
{cps=50}In the Scottish campaigns.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The knight's light blue eyes stare unblinkingly into Rodolfo's face, who responds in kind - piercing the knight with a look full of disgust.
{cps=50}For bravery. Of course. How did I not guess that right away?
{cps=50}Kill him, [name]. May he go to hell.
{cps=50}I saw everything I wanted to see.
{cps=50}You made the right choice, [name]. You're one of us now.
{cps=50}I can't kill him. He's unarmed.
{cps=50}Now is not the time for moralizing, [name]. We have no other way.
{cps=50}I. Will. Not. Kill. Him.
{cps=50}I'm willing to fight, but not with the unarmed.
{cps=50}He won't last long any...
{cps=50}We are not noble warriors, [name]. We are ragamuffins hiding in the woods and living half-starved.
{cps=50}We do not serve the lords and do not receive a weighty purse of florins for our service.
{cps=50}We protect the destitute and the downtrodden who pay us with a piece of stale bread and a prayer because that's all they have.
{cps=50}Because the rest is taken away from them by knights like these.
{cps=50}Noble lads hung with chains for bravery, who, by an unfortunate coincidence, simply serve an evil master.
{cps=50}Each of them has a thousand excuses for what they are doing. And each of them may well turn out to be a really good person. A kind guy who just happened to be on the wrong side of the fence.
{cps=50}But it's their choice. They have made it themselves.
{cps=50}And you, [name], have made yours.
{cps=50}So it's time to get used to it.
{cps=50}However, you, like everyone else, did not come here for money, delicious food, and a comfortable life - so there was not much to complain about.
{cps=50}However, even such a life was obviously better than a date with the executioner - so there was not much to complain about.
{cps=50}Friends, we have waited a long time for this day. And now it's finally here.
{cps=50}Today we are not taking up arms to give our enemies another painful, but not lethal scratch. Today we take up arms to strike the enemy in the heart.
{cps=50}Tonight, the history of the Caldwell house will finally come to an end.
{cps=50}Those of you who have been with me for a long time know how much innocent blood this cursed family has spilled. They know how many times I swore to end them and how many times I failed.
{cps=50}Today I am finally ready to fulfill my promise.
{cps=50}But the success will depend on you.
{cps=50}Remember what brought you here and don't pity the enemies. Because they won't pity you.
{cps=50}The defenders of the estate, who have not yet had time to figure out what is happening, are unable to mount a proper defense, and you manage to capture the main gate without much difficulty.
{cps=50}The defenders' counterattack fails and, just a quarter of an hour after the battle began, it is all over.
{cps=50}Back at the camp, Duncan's men throw an epic bash in an atmosphere of universal jubilation. Watching their genuine fun from the sidelines and still suffering from internal reflections, you can't think of anything better than getting drunk with everyone.
{cps=50}But before you can do so, someone's hand comes down on your shoulder again.
{cps=50}You don't look happy, [name].
{cps=50}We've done a great job. We saved a lot of people.
{cps=50}Avenged a lot of innocents. My friends. Rodolfo's parents.
{cps=50}I didn't know about his parents.
{cps=50}We don't have a gathering of mourners here, [name], to shed tears and tell each other heartbreaking stories.
{cps=50}Each of us ended up here for different reasons. But all of them are valid enough.
{cps=50}So what happens now? After we won.
{cps=50}Won?
{cps=50}Ha! Don't be so naive, [name]!
{cps=50}All we've done is cut off one of the hydra's heads. Yes — the most fanged and bloodthirsty one — but the beast to which it belonged is nowhere near defeated.
{cps=50}I don't know if you've been following the news, [name], but the old king went on to the next world not too long ago, and all his friends and heirs are fighting among themselves.
{cps=50}All the nobles of the kingdom are now vying for the throne and the chance to snatch a bigger piece of the pie. Which means that while they slit each other's throats, we can slit their own.
{cps=50}The Caldwells were the first step. And that spark that burned their bloody castle down will soon ignite a giant bonfire that will engulf the entire kingdom.
{cps=50}But wouldn't it make more sense to try to negotiate? Offer assistance to one of the parties in exchange for preferences.
{cps=50}Yes, we can hide in the woods and burn down one more, two more, three more castles. But it won't last forever.
{cps=50}I've served in the royal army and I've seen how powerful a king is. How many knights and soldiers he can gather under his banners.
{cps=50}As soon as their internecine squabble is over and another ass, whosever it would be, sits firmly on the throne, we will be targeted with priority.
{cps=50}And then no one will open the gates of the capital for a handful of florins, and Rodolfo and Jones will not, even in a hundred years, raise as many men as the new king will put up against us.
{cps=50}This system, as vicious as it is, is too robust to be overturned by someone like us.
{cps=50}We will have to negotiate.
{cps=50}This is your fear talking, [name]. That's why you're suggesting to submit. Bow your head, tuck your tail, and ask for forgiveness before it's too late.
{cps=50}You're not the first person I've heard this from, and here's what I tell you all about it.
{cps=50}You can't comply your way out of tyranny.
{cps=50}The barons have the Magna Carta that guarantees them their rights. Do you know how they got it, [name]? They fought for it.
{cps=50}They fought until the king became afraid and he himself came to them with his head bowed.
{cps=50}But the common people have no such Magna Carta. All they have is just a mug smeared with dirt from constant work, which any 'nobleman' can spit on.
{cps=50}And he will definitely spit. Just because he can, and because he knows that he will suffer no consequences for it.
{cps=50}We have to fight, [name]. And we will fight. For the sake of being seen as human.
{cps=50}The saved-up money comes in handy and makes it possible to provide this growing army with both food and equipment.
{cps=50}Seeing what the florins collected in Greenwich went for, Rodolfo, who has been taking that decision very hard, finally begins to feel better.
{cps=50}Despite their disastrous situation, the defenders of the castle continue to fight desperately to the last man, causing you huge losses.
{cps=50}The personal standard of the marquis flying on the spire is torn off and thrown down. The marquis himself, who was captured wounded, is first publicly tortured and then executed, to general rejoicing.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}[attackchance] florins received!
{cps=50}[name]! Where the hell have you been?!
{cps=50}There are peasants making mincemeat out of each other under the castle walls!
{cps=50}Grab your stuff and follow me!
{cps=50}Grabbing your gear, you follow Jones, who, while gathering more men along the way, leads you to a vast near-castle settlement bordering the marquis' residence on several sides.
{cps=50}What the hell are you doing, [name]! These are common people!
{cps=50}We are not at war! Hit them on the noggin and knock them down, not kill them!
{cps=50}Together you manage to restore order, but not without casualties. About half a dozen brawlers are left lying breathless in the mud.
{cps=50}The Sheriff, who apparently did not expect to see that, does not hurry with the assault and sends negotiators to the castle several times, offering the defenders to pay off.
{cps=50}Under the pressure of the storming troops, the defenders of the castle leave one of the towers and the sheriff's men manage to break into the castle...
{cps=50}The details of the conversation that took place between the earl's representative and the new Marquis of Chippenham are not known to you. However, even before the messenger has time to leave the castle, Duncan summons you.
{cps=50}Come on in, [name]. It's good to see you.
{cps=50}I'll be honest, after that Rodolfo thing, I've been keeping an eye on you. To tell the truth, I had some doubts.
{cps=50}But fortunately, they all turned out to be nonsense. You have proved by deed, not by word, that I can count on you...
{cps=50}And you know what? I am gonna make it worth your while.
{cps=50}As you yourself should know, our position in Chippenham is somewhat precarious.
{cps=50}Today we are the masters here, but tomorrow things could easily change.
{cps=50}We need a... Legitimization.
{cps=50}A nice word, huh? It even sounds weighty. It was some smart people here who suggested it to me.
{cps=50}Simply put, we need to make friends with those who hold the official power.
{cps=50}In peacetime, they wouldn't even pay attention to people like you and me, but war opens the most unexpected doors.
{cps=50}I have just had the pleasure of hosting a representative of Earl Northampton, the closest associate of Prince Edward, who is trying to regain the throne.
{cps=50}And the earl has made it clear that if we can provide him with substantial assistance against Count Canterbury leading the rebellion, Chippenham will be ours. Officially.
{cps=50}I will officially become a marquis and swear an oath of allegiance to the new king, turning from a criminal into a respected nobleman. And all of you, as my people and loyal servants, will be given a place at my court and a good salary instead of a torture chamber and a chopping block.
{cps=50}And then, you never know, knighthood may loom on the horizon...
{cps=50}That's the way it is, friend.
{cps=50}You are an experienced man of war of mine. So it falls to you to defend the honor of the new Marquis of Chippenham.
{cps=50}I'm sure you won't let me down.
{cps=50}Obviously, I am not asking for your consent, as you should be the one thanking me for such an opportunity.
{cps=50}You'll be in full view of princes and earls there; present yourself well and then make a mark in battle — you'll surely also earn a bunch of all sorts of awards.
{cps=50}Take around four dozen good men with you, gather up, and move out to Windsor — that's where Northampton's siege camp is located.
{cps=50}Report to him once you get there. After that, it is all up to you.
{cps=50}So come on. I'm counting on you and your success, buddy.
{cps=50}Good luck!{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [surviving_windsor.name!ti].
{cps=50}D-duke of Cornwall, Charles Ex, writes to you, sire, that he will send a hundred militia n-next week...
{cps=50}The Tenth, not ex, idiot.
{cps=50}Pardon me, sire...
{cps=50}It's all clear with Charles Ex. Is there anything else?
{cps=50}Sire, my name is [name] and I have come to you by order of Duncan, Marquis of Chippenham, at the head of a detachment of fifty men.
{cps=50}Chippenham, you say? Yeah, yeah, I remember him.
{cps=50}Well, [name], you're just in time. We're planning another assault the day after tomorrow, and the new batch of militia, as you may have just heard, is still at least a couple of weeks away.
{cps=50}I was already thinking of abandoning the plans and giving the besieged a forced respite, but your appearance will allow us to keep up the pressure on the fortress.
{cps=50}Might even be able to capture something.
{cps=50}Your men will lead the attack.
{cps=50}Understood, sire. What's the plan?
{cps=50}Are you deaf? I've just told you — you and your men will lead the attack.
{cps=50}I... I understood, sire. But we'll have someone to back us up, right?
{cps=50}Ha.{w} Maybe.{w} Maybe not.{w} Or maybe you should shut your trap and leave planning operations to me, how about that?
{cps=50}Your task is simple: divert attention to yourselves, take the first blow, and exhaust the enemy, paving the way for those who actually know how to fight.
{cps=50}If the situation is favorable, then the second wave will follow you.
{cps=50}And well, if it isn't favorable, then there will be no second wave. Then you'll go back.
{cps=50}To the extent possible.
{cps=50}I understood, sire.
{cps=50}That's it. Dismissed.
{cps=50}Oh, and by the way, what was your name? [name]? Have we met anywhere before, by any chance?
{cps=50}Yes, sire. Under Cambrai.
{cps=50}Cambrai...
{cps=50}Cambrai was the first circle of hell, lad.{w} Welcome to the ninth.
{cps=50}No, sire.
{cps=50}That's what I thought. I would definitely remember such a sly mug.
{cps=50}Its spray reaches you as well, leaving some terrible burns.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 2!

{cps=50}The attack progresses successfully and you almost manage to reach the exit to the lower city...
{cps=50}[name]! Our hero has returned from the war!
{cps=50}I announce a feast in your honor this evening. The whole neighborhood will be there!
{cps=50}While you were away, we got in touch with suppliers of first-class wine from the continent — so no more stinking swill from English boozers. Only first-class drinks — Champagne, Alsace, and Burgundy!
{cps=50}No other is served at the court of the Marquis of Chippenham.
{cps=50}So, I recall I promised you a lucrative position at my place, huh?
{cps=50}We, nobles, keep our word. I'm offering you the post of the captain of my guard. Actually, it was Jones' position, but he and I have recently had some... disagreements.
{cps=50}So he has now, to everyone's regret, left us. While the position, accordingly, has been vacated again.
{cps=50}I'm offering you a salary... Well, let's start with 500 florins per month.
{cps=50}And then we'll see.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 17 of 19.
{cps=50}No more, Duncan.{w} No more of this.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}{i}Ending 18 of 19.
{cps=50}We did it, [name].
{cps=50}After so many years, so much suffering... We finally did it.
{cps=50}But this is just the beginning.
{cps=50}We will turn the whole kingdom upside down, but we will get to every tyrant and exploiter.
{cps=50}I can't believe this, [name].
{cps=50}I just can't...
{cps=50}What did we strive for? What did we fight for?
{cps=50}So that now, after killing the marquis, we could collect exactly the same tribute ourselves?
{cps=50}What did we kill his chain dogs for? To replace them with these mercenaries?
{cps=50}I'm not gonna stand for this, buddy. I've already talked to Jones and he's not too happy about this situation either.
{cps=50}It may sound strange, but we must act.
{cps=50}This isn't a conversation for the castle, though — Duncan has ears everywhere around here.
{cps=50}Jones and I agreed to meet at noon tomorrow at the marquis' hunting grounds, to the north of the castle.
{cps=50}Be there. There we'll discuss it all.
{cps=50}There we'll discuss it all.
{cps=50}About what you did back there in the woods.
{cps=50}I understand that honor is not an empty word to you, but there's no place for nobility in our business.
{cps=50}House Caldwell and all who serve it are sworn enemies of the common people and all those who protect them.
{cps=50}A knight in the forest? The one who fell into our ambush?
{cps=50}It's still bugging you, isn't it?
{cps=50}Don't fill your head with nonsense, [name].
{cps=50}Even if he wasn't lying, all his valor and honor remained in his previous life. Before he became a butcher in the service of the Caldwells.
{cps=50}How does that fashionable nowadays saying go?
{cps=50}'You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.'
{cps=50}He should have died in Scotland.
{cps=50}Or wherever he was awarded for 'bravery'...
{cps=50}What's there to tell? Lords all over the kingdom feed on the blood of poor peasants and laborers, but the Caldwells would give any of them a head start.
{cps=50}Travel to Greenwich and surrounding areas and talk to people. Ask them about the exorbitant tolls and taxes. The arbitrariness of Caldwell's knights and soldiers.
{cps=50}Ask about the gallows standing in the squares and about people dying of hunger, who were robbed of everything they had.
{cps=50}In recent months, Duncan has notably rattled them with his raids around Greenwich. So much so that now old Caldwell is probably wetting his pants with fear at the mere mention of Duncan's name.
{cps=50}And his sadistic daughter huddles under the bed in terror.
{cps=50}However, the Caldwell estate itself is too well fortified for us to capture it.
{cps=50}You need trebuchets and battering rams here, and we have, as they say, only pitchforks and peasants.
{cps=50}Oh well. Duncan's surely got some kind of plan.
{cps=50}He always knows what to do.
{cps=50}Help? That would be really nice.
{cps=50}I have a couple of other ex-soldiers in mind who wouldn't mind joining the squad.
{cps=50}One of them, moreover, was an apprentice to a siege engineer and thus understands something about all kinds of machines. At least according to his own words.
{cps=50}Either way, both of them would be extremely helpful, but there are issues with both.
{cps=50}The first one, who's an apprentice, has a sick brother, so if he goes into the woods, the family will be left without a breadwinner.
{cps=50}Surely it could be helped with some strong medication, but I'm not good at that, for one thing.
{cps=50}And secondly, there is not much money for this either. We barely have enough to feed ourselves...
{cps=50}Anyway, if there's anything you can do to help, it would be very useful.
{cps=50}And well, the other one, who's an infantryman, has drunk all his equipment away since he came back from the war.
{cps=50}I told him right away that I'd have no trouble getting him a gambeson of some kind. But the bastard is stubborn and says he 'won't go to war without proper armor'.
{cps=50}He had some story about being hit with a bow several times and only a gorget with a helmet saved him. And he can't let this subject go ever since.
{cps=50}Though probably for a good reason, if it all really saved his life...
{cps=50}In short, we need to get him some kind of helmet and a gorget. Preferably decent ones. It would be great if you could help us out.
{cps=50}Got the medicine? Great job!{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Item lost — [potent_medicine.name!ti].
{cps=50}Consider that you have done two good deeds at once — returned the breadwinner to his family and got another fighter for our squad.
{cps=50}Thank you, [name].
{cps=50}It's thanks to people like you and Duncan that the common people are drawn to us.
{cps=50}Of course, [name]. What are you interested in?
{cps=50}You've really helped me out, [name]. This guy, of course, is still a drunkard, but it's clear that the bloke is experienced.
{cps=50}And we always need such people.
{cps=50}Well, thanks to you, we now have two more people.
{cps=50}Which means two more pairs of hands that can hold a weapon.
{cps=50}And two more pairs of eyes that will see to it that nobody goes behind our backs in battle.
{cps=50}Of course, it also means plus two hungry mouths that will need to be fed with something, but let Jones and Duncan think about that.
{cps=50}I wish I had something to thank you with, [name], but to tell you the truth, I don't have much to share.
{cps=50}But maybe I could teach you something.
{cps=50}I've seen a lot of things in my life... And I've wandered through the woods with Duncan for more than a month or two.
{cps=50}So if any of my skills could come in handy, let me know. I'd be glad to teach you.
{cps=50}Оh, [name]! I was just looking for you.
{cps=50}As it turns out, you're a hell of a warrior, aren't you?
{cps=50}Kicked the ass of that knight in the woods in a heartbeat.
{cps=50}I was quite a fighter myself back when I was young. But lately, I've shifted, so to speak, to administrative positions, and my form has dropped off.
{cps=50}Anyway, what was I coming to?
{cps=50}It would be nice if you could train the young guys. We have a lot of recruits, but they're mostly former peasants and laborers.
{cps=50}Well, I've told you already.
{cps=50}The lads have strength, but they're a bit lacking in technique. You should work with them a little, so they can wield swords and axes better.
{cps=50}We're all in this together, after all.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [drillmaster.name!ti].
{cps=50}Be well, [name].{vspace=5}Brought any good news?
{cps=50}Great job, [name]. I like doing business with you.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}400 florins lost.
{cps=50}I'll send a messenger to the healer today and arrange for him to visit us a couple of times a week.
{cps=50}I noticed there is no healer in the camp...
{cps=50}Really? You're a big-eyed guy, aren't you?
{cps=50}I'll tell you from experience, Jones, going to war without medical care is a bad idea.
{cps=50}It's strange to me that none of you have thought about it.
{cps=50}Don't think you're the smartest, kid. We've thought about it. And not once.
{cps=50}But here, as you can see, we do not have a royal army with a monthly budget of a million florins.
{cps=50}Instead we've got a 'do-it-yourself' type of army, so to speak.
{cps=50}I have a good healer in mind and he's even somewhat sympathetic to our cause.
{cps=50}However, he is a family man and he wants to sleep on a featherbed with a juicy wife just a little more than to huddle in a dugout with some stinking Rodolfo.
{cps=50}I don't understand what your point is.
{cps=50}My point is that he is willing to visit us occasionally and provide services, but he would like to be compensated for his labors.
{cps=50}And we're a little tight on money, you know.
{cps=50}So, since you yourself raised the issue of a healer, it would be logical, so to speak, to delegate the matter to you.
{cps=50}And how much money is needed?
{cps=50}He's a good specialist, so he won't work for nothing.
{cps=50}I think three hundred florins should be enough.
{cps=50}Although let's make it four hundred. Just to be sure. You never know what other expenses might appear then.
{cps=50}Is there anything else I can do to help the squad?
{cps=50}Did you embrace our idea?{w} Nice to hear!
{cps=50}I think you can see for yourself that our situation is just a little bit dire.
{cps=50}Guys freeze from the cold at night, live half-starved, and have to go into battle in whatever is at hand.
{cps=50}Duncan and I will somehow deal with the first two issues on our own. But we could really use some help with the third one.
{cps=50}What is required of me?
{cps=50}Hmm... Even St. Augustine used to say that there is no ailment that cannot be cured with gold, if you know what I mean...
{cps=50}Did he really say that?
{cps=50}Well, it might be not an exact quote, but I got the gist of it right.
{cps=50}So, if you've suddenly got a couple of extra florins in your pockets, then we — your new and forever faithful brothers in arms — are ready to accept them.
{cps=50}Every last copper will be spent to the equip the guys.{w} You can take my word for it.
{cps=50}What kind of question is that? Of course there is.
{cps=50}We've made some serious improvements lately. In every sense.
{cps=50}None of our guys sleep in the open or starve anymore, but there are still a lot of problems with equipment.
{cps=50}So if you can help in any way, it would be very helpful.{w}{vspace=5}Preferably with money.
{cps=50}Thanks a bunch, [name].
{cps=50}I'll buy something for the guys.
{cps=50}Hello, [name]. Our first meeting was a little spontaneous, so I think we have some catching up to do.
{cps=50}I won't bore you with long stories about who I am and what I'm doing — since you are here, you know all that already.
{cps=50}We are on the verge of great achievements, [name]. I have been fighting for a number of years now and, most of that time, I was a tiny David who tried to overcome a huge Goliath with needle pricks.
{cps=50}I had dogs sicced on me, was whipped, arrested, and tortured. I hid in basements and forests, lived half-starved, and slept on the cold ground.
{cps=50}I gathered supporters one by one and saved up resources bit by bit. For years I was forced to watch the suffering of innocent people helplessly and be content with small raids against their oppressors.
{cps=50}I've been waiting for the right moment for a long while. And now the time has come.
{cps=50}Now we will strike.
{cps=50}Get ready, [name]. We'll move out soon.
{cps=50}Ah, [name], come on in. Got something to discuss with you.
{cps=50}I need a little help.
{cps=50}I need someone to go to one of my partners and give him a certain sum of money.
{cps=50}Normally such matters are handled by Jones, but he is somewhat preoccupied with other affairs at the moment.
{cps=50}And Rodolfo, as you know, is a bit sensitive about money. So it would be a bit strange to entrust him with such a mission.
{cps=50}Especially considering where exactly you have to go.
{cps=50}And where to?
{cps=50}To the Sheriff.
{cps=50}To the...{w} Sheriff? Did I hear that right?
{cps=50}Perhaps I am wrong, but I have the impression that our activities are, how shall I put it, a little bit illegal.
{cps=50}And are punishable by death.
{cps=50}And there's a bounty on each of our heads.
{cps=50}A voluntary trip to the Sheriff seems just a little bit counterintuitive.
{cps=50}You have the right idea.
{cps=50}But let me answer your question with a question: have you ever wondered how it happened that the gates of the Caldwell residence opened in front of us on their own?
{cps=50}Or, why is the local sheriff, who has a hundred warriors under his command, not very active in hunting us down?
{cps=50}I haven't really thought about it.
{cps=50}Well, do so then. And in the process, go see him and hand over this jingling bag.
{cps=50}This task, as you can see, is a delicate one, and I can't entrust it to just anyone. So try not to let me down.
{cps=50}And I, in turn, will not forget it.
{cps=50}Well, friends? The victory over the Caldwells was a huge success for us, but our fight is far from over.
{cps=50}As the rumors of our accomplishments spread further and further, more and more people come to me from all over the kingdom...
{cps=50}...who tell about the arbitrary and atrocious practices of their nobles, as well as of the terrible existence that the good people of those lands are forced to endure.
{cps=50}There are many places where people crave our help, but we must soberly assess our strength.
{cps=50}Therefore, it is logical to turn our efforts to where we already have ready allies.
{cps=50}Right now an actual peasant war is raging in Chippenham against Marquis Radcliffe, who was exiled to govern those lands.
{cps=50}As far as we know from the rumors and stories that have reached us, the marquis' cruelty rallied the local population against him and forced many peasants to take up pitchforks or go into the woods.
{cps=50}This state of affairs makes me think that we will have no trouble with volunteers or supplies in Chippenham.
{cps=50}However, what we certainly can't do without is money.
{cps=50}Jones, how are we doing with finances?
{cps=50}Because of the fire, we managed to take out only a fraction of what we could've looted at the Caldwell estate. If we want to take active action against a strong opponent, then we will need more. Much more.
{cps=50}And what about our profits?
{cps=50}There are some. We get paid to maintain order on the main trade routes that used to be guarded by the Caldwells' people. But in the big picture, it's a pittance, of course. Spare change in the pockets. It's not enough to fund any serious activities.
{cps=50}When it comes to money - you always have ideas. I hope this time is no exception.
{cps=50}The Caldwells are gone, but their land hasn't gone anywhere. There are still fields that are tilled and forests that are hunted in. Mills, where flour is produced, and inns, where ale is poured.
{cps=50}Some of it is now actively being taken over by mercenary groups, routiers, or simple gangs of armed peasants. And if earlier taxes, fees, and tolls were paid to the Greenwich estate, now all those florins go into the pockets of these new players.
{cps=50}Well, if the reality is that money will still be paid to someone, then...
{cps=50}...Then why not make it so that it is paid to us.
{cps=50}Are you out of your mind? What kind of nonsense are you talking about?
{cps=50}We didn't overthrow the Caldwells just so we could take their place!
{cps=50}Hold your horses, Rodolfo. No one is talking about taking 'their place' and taxing everyone around us exorbitantly.
{cps=50}Let them chip in a couple of florins as a token of respect for our help. It won't hurt them.
{cps=50}Especially since, as I just told you, the Caldwells' holdings are already being actively divided and taken over by everyone right now.
{cps=50}The reality is that people are going to pay someone anyway. So it's better if they pay a little to us rather than a lot to someone else.
{cps=50}I don't like this plan.
{cps=50}Then perhaps you have some better ideas?
{cps=50}You've been with me almost from the very beginning, friend. And you've seen how much hard work and sacrifice even this relatively small victory cost us.
{cps=50}If we want to go further, if we want to kindle a flame strong enough to burn all the tyrants in it and liberate the entire kingdom, we need resources.
{cps=50}We overthrew the Caldwells and didn't make a single florin out of it.
{cps=50}We maintain order on these lands without seeking to enrich ourselves.
{cps=50}And I don't think it would be a terrible thing for someone who is financially well off to pay us for protection from brigands and marauders.
{cps=50}Especially since all that money will go to a good cause.
{cps=50}I want to believe you, but I'm afraid we're making a mistake.
{cps=50}I understand, friend. And I swear to you that every florin we receive here will be used for one thing only — the overthrow of another tyrant. Every single one. From the first to the last.
{cps=50}I swear to you.
{cps=50}I believe you.
{cps=50}The situation repeats itself at the mill of Fat Tom, a prosperous miller who supplied the Caldwells directly. But this time, it is not a band of peasants that appears at the call of the miller who refuses to pay, but an out-of-nowhere mercenary squad.
{cps=50}After completing the detour of the territory, you return with a quite substantial amount of florins.
{cps=50}Come to your senses. I know you're not happy, but it's not Duncan's fault.
{cps=50}Such is the nature of peasants. They need a strong hand, otherwise, they turn into natural cattle.
{cps=50}You saw it all with your own eyes. We took the yoke off their necks and they repaid the favor by stabbing us in the back.
{cps=50}If you don't want them stabbing you in the back, maybe you should put your hand out of their pocket. That's not why we came to Chippenham.
{cps=50}We came here to overthrow a tyrant and free the people.
{cps=50}Our job is done and we have no right to linger here and force people to live by our rules. And especially make them pay us anything.
{cps=50}Rodolfo, listen...
{cps=50}No, you listen! Bloody Duncan has already returned a good two-thirds of the taxes that the marquis used to collect.
{cps=50}This money is used to pay the mercenary gangs that travel around Chippenham as if they were at home, while Sir 'Liberator' himself hides behind a moat and stone walls with crossbowmen.
{cps=50}What kind of liberation is that?!
{cps=50}Whom have we freed and from what?
{cps=50}You refuse to see the reality.
{cps=50}No, you're the one refusing. I thought that you understood me. That you could tell good from evil.
{cps=50}But it looks like I was wrong.
{cps=50}Don't do anything stupid, friend.
{cps=50}I'm not your friend anymore. And Duncan is no longer my commander.
{cps=50}I had the strength to defeat the Caldwells. I had the strength to defeat the marquis. And I have the strength to defeat Duncan.
{cps=50}If he refuses to see for himself, I will open his eyes. Even if I have to cut them out of his head.
{cps=50}Loose!
{cps=50}Forgive me, friend. It wasn't I who came up with the rules by which this world exists.
{cps=50}Just don't tell me you're in it with him too, [name].
{cps=50}Killing two friends in one day is a lot even by my standards.
{cps=50}So, I see that everyone is present. Great.
{cps=50}How do you like my outfit, huh? I've just returned from a meeting with the chairman of the Chippenham merchant guild — I had to dress up more decently.
{cps=50}Since, you know, those peddlers are all about the appearance.
{cps=50}So what's on the agenda?
{cps=50}Jones, was the Rodolfo issue solved?
{cps=50}Yes.
{cps=50}Definitively?
{cps=50}Definitively.
{cps=50}That is unfortunate.
{cps=50}But what can you do... Let this situation be a lesson to all of you.
{cps=50}You have a right to your opinion and I appreciate it. But I deal with traitors quickly.
{cps=50}Adding to the list of unpleasant news, the Greenwich sheriff is on his way here to get even with us for the marquis.
{cps=50}If I once took this castle with only under a hundred ragamuffins by my side, then the Sheriff can do it too.
{cps=50}Which means we have a lot of work ahead of us if we want to keep our heads on our shoulders...

{cps=50}You have to leave your chest behind...
{cps=50}You cannot pay off the debt and so you negotiate a deferment.
{cps=50}The situation is changing. The battle might soon be coming to an end...
{cps=50}The surviving enemies retreat...
{cps=50}You're not being nice, Roger.
{cps=50}Your master and I have made a deal. I defect to his side and receive 3,000 florins for it. No more and no less.
{cps=50}Ha! Just look at this little devil, boys!
{cps=50}You're not a moneylender's son, by any chance? You would be better off counting florins in a shop than swinging a sword.
{cps=50}All right then.{w} Let's deal with it this way: your money will stay with me for now — for safekeeping, naturally.
{cps=50}The boss, if you recall, said not only to pay you but also to test you in action. That's what we'll start with.
{cps=50}What do I have to do?
{cps=50}Well, nothing special.
{cps=50}Simply survive.
{cps=50}The boys and I have a mutual friend here who is constantly having... difficulties with sparring partners.
{cps=50}He'll smash one guy's head in, then he'll hit the other one so hard that the lad will start stuttering.
{cps=50}If Northampton sent you on important and dangerous missions, you must be a good fighter.
{cps=50}So let's see whether you're worth 3,000 florins or not.
{cps=50}Under the influence of your authority, all your squad members agree to also go into the service of Count Canterbury.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige, Reputation (soldiers) check passed!
{cps=50}Your squad members refuse to also go into the service of Count Canterbury and desert.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige, Reputation (soldiers) check failed!
{cps=50}You leave the abbey and head towards London together with Roger and his men.
{cps=50}A few hours later, you find yourself on the outskirts of the capital and immediately witness a picture that makes an indelible impression.
{cps=50}Remembering the words of Northampton and Prince Edward, you expect to find some sort of 'large rebel force' near the capital, but what you see exceeds any expectations.
{cps=50}On the approach to London you find nothing less than a huge military camp, the size of which is quite comparable — and maybe even superior — to the one that was once set up by the English outside Cambrai.
{cps=50}There was a small detachment available to the prince at Dartford. In the fields near London, Count Canterbury has got a full-fledged army at his disposal.
{cps=50}After arriving at the camp, Roger, who is clearly a big shot here, immediately gives out some instructions and, a couple of minutes later, you find yourself on the training ground — surrounded by a chanting crowd and with a huge, steel-clad giant in front of you.
{cps=50}Well, lads?! Watch closely!
{cps=50}We've practically got the biblical David vs. Goliath story here.
{cps=50}I bet fifty that David's head will be smashed in!
{cps=50}[name] or whatever your name is — this is your test! You last 20 rounds and maybe me and the boys will stop thinking you look like a pile of shit!
{cps=50}And if you don't, then thanks for the 3,000 florins!
{cps=50}Get him, Goliath!
{cps=50}To everyone's surprise — and Roger's extreme chagrin — you kill your opponent in battle.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige increased by 3!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 20!
{cps=50}To everyone's surprise — and Roger's extreme chagrin — you manage to hold out for the allotted time.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 10!
{cps=50}After swearing and cursing a few times, the red-haired knight, however, quickly gets over his irritation and gives you credit: first figuratively, praising your quickness in the fight with Goliath, and then directly, handing you the promised 3,000 florins.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}3000 florins received!
{cps=50}Well, you've proven your skills, no argument there. But that's only half of the test.
{cps=50}Now it's time to prove your loyalty to the count, as well as to our common cause, in deed.
{cps=50}The other day, my men caught two fellows from Northampton's retinue in the vicinity of Dartford.
{cps=50}The guys are combative - not only did they not give up without a fight and did not utter a single word during interrogations, but they also managed to attempt escape.
{cps=50}Be so kind, [name], do Count Canterbury a favor... Send them to the afterlife.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}On Roger's order, two tall men are brought out from somewhere in the camp - very shabby, but obviously still able and willing to fight back.
{cps=50}There they are, fine fellows.
{cps=50}If my boys ended up in Northampton's clutches, I bet he'd slit their throats and throw them in a ditch! But that's not how we do things.
{cps=50}Fletcher! Hand them weapons and armor.
{cps=50}And you two, listen up here and listen carefully...
{cps=50}See this young man here. He is the only obstacle on your path to freedom. Kill him and I'll let you go.
{cps=50}And you, [name], must kill them.
{cps=50}You want to become a part of us? Blood in, blood out.
{cps=50}Gold weighs a lot, of course, but blood is still heavier.
{cps=50}You're one of us now, [name].
{cps=50}Now, you're a man of Count Canterbury, and as long as you're loyal to him, he'll take care of you.
{cps=50}And if you ever decide to switch sides again, remember, you've got nowhere to run now.
{cps=50}Judging by the fact that you are here, I conclude that Roger has deemed you worthy.
{cps=50}Which is good news, because I have plans for you.
{cps=50}Before we get started, though, let's get you sorted out first.
{cps=50}So, why did you decide to switch sides?
{cps=50}Since you responded to my offer only after I mentioned a quite considerable sum, it seems to me that it's about money.
{cps=50}Am I right?
{cps=50}I am capable of loyalty, but I want a decent payment for my blood.
{cps=50}Not the handouts that the prince and the earl threw my way.
{cps=50}Well, at least that's honest.
{cps=50}I don't hold on to gold. For me, wealth is only a means to achieve necessary goals.
{cps=50}However, as befits any astute investor, I always protect my investments. No matter who stands in my way, be it a peasant pretending to be a knight or the king himself — if I put my money somewhere, I get what I'm owed.
{cps=50}So do fairly what is required of you, and the florins will regularly flow into your pocket. Break your oath to me — and your head will be brought to me on a platter.
{cps=50}No?
{cps=50}It's even a bit of a shame that it's not.
{cps=50}As a business person, I always find it easier to work with measurable things. Like money, for example.
{cps=50}You didn't like your income in one place and you moved on to another. I can understand that.
{cps=50}I pay you more than anyone else, and you serve me faithfully. A logical and natural scheme.
{cps=50}However, if you decide to switch sides because of... feelings, then things are no longer so simple here, for today your feelings dictate that you sympathize with my side, and tomorrow...
{cps=50}Who knows what may happen tomorrow?
{cps=50}I won't press you for an answer.
{cps=50}Roger took your oath and tested you. If you switched sides, you had your reasons. So be it.
{cps=50}I will only say that, unlike Northampton, I know the value of my allies.
{cps=50}Are you not afraid to trust me? After all, not so long ago I was among your enemies...
{cps=50}Betrayal is one of the worst sins possible.
{cps=50}But fortunately for you, I'm in politics, not theology.
{cps=50}And in politics, utility always comes before virtue.
{cps=50}The old king was a virtuous man. But what good is this virtue when some of your subjects have empty pockets and others have nothing to eat?
{cps=50}Virtue does not win battles. It cannot be used to build a road or a bridge, a castle or a church. You can't redeem a promissory note with it, you can't arm people with it, or leave it as a dowry for your daughter.
{cps=50}Virtue inspires respect but does not ensure loyalty.
{cps=50}Yet utility does. People will follow the one who puts bread on their tables and a florin in their pockets. The one who can earn good money for himself and will also give them the opportunity to earn good money.
{cps=50}You are useful to me and so I am willing to turn a blind eye to the lack of virtue in your deeds.
{cps=50}And I, in turn, am useful to you: money, titles, and a cozy place at the court of the new king of a prosperous kingdom - that's what awaits you in case of my victory.
{cps=50}It suits me fine.
{cps=50}Great. Then let's get down to business.
{cps=50}In a few hours I will be speaking at the London Parliament, where I will report to its members on the progress of the war effort.
{cps=50}You will attend this session with me.
{cps=50}And you will tell the honorable parliamentarians what I'll tell you to.
{cps=50}Count Canterbury's address to the Parliament begins with a report on the progress of his military preparations. All the figures you hear — the number of recruits enlisted, the amount of food procured, the number of wagons with equipment, and the sums of money allocated for it all — make you dizzy.
{cps=50}It seems that you can consider your first task successfully completed.
{cps=50}Seems that way.
{cps=50}I have no assignments for you. You'll be at the disposal of Roger, my right-hand man, for the time being.
{cps=50}He's currently working on getting the local lords on our side, so he would likely need your help.
{cps=50}But sire... If I may... The prince and the earl's forces are tiny — you could easily crush them even with the troops you have now.
{cps=50}Why do you need to recruit new troops? And even more so, why bring the lords on your side?
{cps=50}Don't try to look smart, [name]. It's worth it to get allies on your side at least in order to prevent your enemy from dragging them over to his own.
{cps=50}The more men Roger can convince to stand under our banners, the fewer will be willing to kill you in the next battle.
{cps=50}So take your assignment seriously.
{cps=50}But what about the Parliament...
{cps=50}The Parliament? You can consider this an example of a successful conduct of business, [name].
{cps=50}I invested three thousand florins in you, and thanks to you I got three million.
{cps=50}So what's next, sire?
{cps=50}Next? Turn three million into thirty.
{cps=50}And when you have thirty million, you can start thinking about your own kingdom.
{cps=50}And what was that?
{cps=50}I suppose Northampton sends his regards. Very much in his style.
{cps=50}Years go by, yet he still relies on the same arsenal of overused tricks. It's a pathetic sight.
{cps=50}It may be pathetic, but I don't hold it against him. Especially since he has, unknowingly, played into our hands.
{cps=50}Sir auditor, you can get out of there! It's over.
{cps=50}Y-y-you sure? T-t-to be honest, I am f-f-fine here too.
{cps=50}I am not r-r-really in a hurry...
{cps=50}The killers could be back. It's best not to stay here.
{cps=50}Y-y-you sure?
{cps=50}I am sure.
{cps=50}Nice shot. Vettori would have liked it.
{cps=50}I can't stand it when people tell me how and what I should spend my money on.
{cps=50}The Parliament will assign you a new lookout in his place.
{cps=50}They will. But it will take a long time before the next auditor is up to speed. And that's exactly what I need.
{cps=50}All right. Now about you, [name].
{cps=50}I have summoned you to inform you that in the upcoming battle you will act in the vanguard of my forces.
{cps=50}My informants at Dartford report that Prince Edward's troops will march tomorrow at dawn.
{cps=50}Giving them a battle so soon was not part of my plans, but our alliance with the duke, your defection to my side, as well as the demise of an entire detachment of their best men near Cambridge, seriously reshapes the balance.
{cps=50}I was planning on playing a long game, but it doesn't seem necessary anymore. They seek out battle out of desperation rather than cold reasoning — and it will ruin them.
{cps=50}If they want to fight so badly, we'll give them a fight.
{cps=50}Roger told me that you can be relied upon and that you are very good with weapons.
{cps=50}Well, through me Fate gives you a chance to prove yourself.
{cps=50}Winning tomorrow's battle will divide your life into 'before' and 'after'. Defeat, on the other hand, could easily ruin you.
{cps=50}So don't miss your chance.
{cps=50}You may go.
{cps=50}It's over, sire.
{cps=50}Only Northampton has slipped away, but he had no more than a dozen men with him.
{cps=50}The rest are dead. There's blood up to the ankles, enough for the feet to sink.
{cps=50}The prince?
{cps=50}Dead. Someone from the militia hacked him with an axe.
{cps=50}A shudder in the loins engenders there.{w}{vspace=5}The broken wall, the burning roof and tower.
{cps=50}And Agamemnon dead.
{cps=50}The king's son in gold-plated armor is hacked to death by a commoner's rusty axe.
{cps=50}And an army of noble knights is defeated by squads of yesterday's navvies and tailors.
{cps=50}The era of mythical heroes is over, [name]. The time of people is coming.
{cps=50}What you have seen today is the future of war.
{cps=50}Courage counts for a lot, but it's the numbers that win.
{cps=50}Amounts of monthly expenditures. Miles of roads suitable for supplying the army. Volumes of provisions procured. Pounds of steel melted.
{cps=50}Money. Logistics. Tables, statements, timesheets, and maps.
{cps=50}Cold calculation.
{cps=50}This is the future of war.
{cps=50}Even though many people don't realize it yet.
{cps=50}Here come the allies. Just in time.
{cps=50}The fat Cambridge rat is the same as always.
{cps=50}No one seriously counted on his help anyway.
{cps=50}We bought him for the sake of keeping him from taking the opposite side.
{cps=50}The prince's courage, Northampton's cunning, and the troops of Cambridge, mixed in one cauldron, might have been a bone even in my throat.
{cps=50}Although who knows.
{cps=50}Anyway, there are now only three pieces left on this board — me, Cambridge, and the loudmouths from the Parliament.
{cps=50}We'll soon find out how much more the word of a duke is worth than the word of an ordinary commoner.
{cps=50}Your services to Count Canterbury have not gone unnoticed and you have been initiated into knights bannerets.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You have been promoted to Knight-banneret.
{cps=50}Come in, [name]. I've got a lot to do, so I'll be brief.
{cps=50}As the events of the last few days show, our Cambridge business partner is playing some sort of his own game.
{cps=50}I assumed he was up to something like this, but I am not yet able to fully reveal his plan.
{cps=50}Yes, he could sic the Parliament on me, but what good would that do if I've already emptied their pockets?
{cps=50}Their word, apart from the gold and steel to back it up, is worthless. So it makes no sense for the duke to rely on them - they have nothing to offer him.
{cps=50}Which means there's some other factor. Some other actor hiding in the shadows.
{cps=50}Realistically, there is only one man left on this side of Calais with enough power to be able to threaten me by joining forces with the Parliament and Cambridge.
{cps=50}But he's far up north. Far enough away that I don't have to worry about him.
{cps=50}At least he was up until recently.
{cps=50}As you can see, I can't take any chances, [name]. There's too much at stake.
{cps=50}You will travel up north to the border city of York. And you will personally make sure that the troops of the Scottish King James did not cross the border.
{cps=50}This matter is urgent, so move out today.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [the_missing_link.name!ti].
{cps=50}Well, gentlemen, it looks like the masks are off.
{cps=50}When that old rat accepted our offer without bargaining, I immediately knew there was a stench of shit in the air.
{cps=50}Such a move on the part of old Henry was indeed predictable. He agreed to everything too readily.
{cps=50}He had a chance to fill his pockets, but he decided it wasn't enough. And so he came with a whole bag.
{cps=50}Well, it's not a bad plan. Why share anything with me when you can have it all for yourself?
{cps=50}And what will the Scots get then, sire?
{cps=50}The most obvious option is the crown.
{cps=50}Henry, as I said earlier, will take over all the lands that have lost their owners, and James will become King of England and Scotland at the same time.
{cps=50}Naturally, some sort of dynastic marriage is likely also implied. James will marry one of the duke's daughters, binding their families together by blood.
{cps=50}As a result, half of the kingdom will belong to Henry directly — by the fact of land ownership, and the remaining piece — indirectly, by the fact of family ties.
{cps=50}And considering that James is more of a noble slasher than a cunning schemer...
{cps=50}Sly.{w} Fat.{w} Rat.
{cps=50}I'm telling you. The plan is not so bad.
{cps=50}The only thing he did not take into account was that it takes at least two weeks for a large army to travel from York to London.
{cps=50}Stupid mistake.{w} The old man clearly should've at least occasionally ridden to war with us once in a while.
{cps=50}It's always smooth on paper...
{cps=50}So what's the plan?
{cps=50}The plan?{w} The plan is simple.
{cps=50}Over-intrigue the intriguer.
{cps=50}Well, pig? Did your Scots help you?
{cps=50}Roger! [name]! Come to your senses!
{cps=50}It won't be long before he gets here...
{cps=50}How do you like such an intrigue, fatso?{w}{vspace=5}Did you not calculate this move?!
{cps=50}Grab him, [name], and drag him downstairs. He's got a date with the executioner.
{cps=50}Greetings, Your Majesty.
{cps=50}And hello to you too, Count.
{cps=50}Got to be unusual to see me so far from the mountains, eh?
{cps=50}Unusual indeed.
{cps=50}It's usually you English who come to visit us, but I thought it might be time to pay a return courtesy visit.
{cps=50}I see you've got some nice places here.
{cps=50}Just look at the city you've built up. Maybe we should stay here, what do you think?
{cps=50}I think we'll like it here. Especially since, as I have heard, you no longer have a king.
{cps=50}And I happen to be a king. What a coincidence.
{cps=50}James. We both know that it is all over.
{cps=50}This was your only chance to win and you blew it.
{cps=50}If you haven't defeated me by now, you won't defeat me anymore. It's over.
{cps=50}What are you talking about, Alfred? I have several thousand of Scotland's finest warriors behind me.
{cps=50}A third of your men is dead, another third has fled. If we keep fighting, I'll sweep you away tomorrow morning.
{cps=50}And what then? Are you going to bang your forehead against London's ramparts?
{cps=50}This city has got more stray cats alone than you have soldiers.
{cps=50}And its fortifications were built by the Romans, so they will not fall from the sounds of the trumpets of Jericho. In other words, you'll be stuck here for a long time.
{cps=50}We're in the very heart of England, James. You are four hundred miles away from home, you have got enough provisions in your wagons for a week at most, and all your supply lines rely on a single road that is about to turn into a muddy mess because of the fall rains.
{cps=50}For every soldier I've lost today, I'll have ten new ones arriving tomorrow.
{cps=50}And how many people are coming to join you tomorrow, James?
{cps=50}I don't think there's a lot.
{cps=50}Let's put an end to this story. You've tried your luck, and now you're out of it.
{cps=50}It's not too late to turn back. Scotland doesn't need to lose its king so young.
{cps=50}I've come too far to return home with nothing, Alfred.
{cps=50}It is my army that stands at the gates of your capital, not the other way around. My sword at your throat.
{cps=50}And if you want me to take it away, then you'll have to pay for it.
{cps=50}And what do you want?
{cps=50}Apparently, I'm not going to get the English crown. I agree here.
{cps=50}But what about the strip of border land north of York?
{cps=50}In my opinion, this is an acceptable demand.
{cps=50}Well then. In deference to you, James, I suggest we settle this dispute your way. The Scottish way.
{cps=50}Two of your best warriors against two of mine.
{cps=50}Let's set the war between the kingdoms aside. Let our dispute be resolved in a fair duel between the knights.
{cps=50}If your men win, I'll cede the border lands to you.
{cps=50}If my men win, you'll go home with what you came with.
{cps=50}I recall you mentioning that you have Scotland's finest warriors behind you. If that's true, do you have anything to worry about?
{cps=50}Or am I wrong?
{cps=50}Pf-f-ft. To hell with you, Alfred.
{cps=50}Wallace! Alexander!
{cps=50}Roger. [name].
{cps=50}Well, [name]...{w} Let's kick their asses!
{cps=50}That was a good fight!
{cps=50}It's been a long time since I've encountered someone as nimble and agile as you...
{cps=50}Well, let this be a lesson to me!
{cps=50}Some people are afraid to admit that someone was better than them, but not me.
{cps=50}So you have my respect.
{cps=50}However, keep in mind that I never lose — I either win or I learn.
{cps=50}You taught me a lesson today, and that means I'll be twice as strong next time!
{cps=50}Well, [name]? If my memory serves me correctly, you and I agreed to hold another duel.
{cps=50}This time there will be no stupid time constraints.
{cps=50}You against me. Until one of us begs for mercy or is too badly injured to continue.
{cps=50}The question is — are you ready?
{cps=50}I am ready.
{cps=50}Ready, you say?{w} Let's go get some air...
{cps=50}I need some more time.
{cps=50}Greetings, [name].
{cps=50}What brings you to me?
{cps=50}There's no way you can become even stronger. You're already as strong as an ox.
{cps=50}No way, you say? How about I prove you wrong!
{cps=50}Let's run it back. A second fight to erase all doubts.
{cps=50}Well, we certainly can fight for a second time... But what's in it for me?
{cps=50}I've already proven myself. Now it's you who want to make a point.
{cps=50}H-m-m...
{cps=50}I know a solution. How about raising the bets?
{cps=50}I give you my word that I will defeat you this time.
{cps=50}If that does not happen — then I will take this precious ring off my finger and give it to you.
{cps=50}Now that's interresting. I accept your challenge.
{cps=50}I will require a week to properly prepare. I'll let you know once the time is right.
{cps=50}Thanks for the offer but maybe some other time.
{cps=50}Getting scared a bit? No shame in that.
{cps=50}Let me know if you change your mind.
{cps=50}Ready to fight?
{cps=50}Very good.{w} Let's scrap then.
{cps=50}Well, I'm certainly not a veteran of a dozen military campaigns, but I've seen some stuff - I've been poked with spears, stabbed with swords, chopped with axes, and shot with crossbows...
{cps=50}But I've never seen anything even close like this thing you're wielding.{w} This thing invokes some serious respect.
{cps=50}Especially when it's flying directly at your head.
{cps=50}Ha! You're damn right it does!
{cps=50}Frankly speaking you do look like a weak handshake kind of guy but your words prove that looks can be deceiving!
{cps=50}You definitely know a thing or two about what makes a weapon good.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Strength — fail!
{cps=50}I could tell right away that you definitely know a thing or two about what makes a weapon good.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Strength — success!
{cps=50}A good weapon has to be big and and it has to be heavy. Because big and heavy means reliable.
{cps=50}With this little thing right here, I know for certain that nothing ever will require a second strike — no matter how thick the enemy's armor and helmet are.
{cps=50}I hit a man - the man goes down. End of story.
{cps=50}With that being said though...{w} It's always nice to have some kind of secondary weapon by your side.
{cps=50}I used to have this very good dagger but, alas, I lost it somewhere. To my great chagrin.
{cps=50}How could you 'lose it somewhere'?
{cps=50}I had a little too much to drink that day...
{cps=50}Oh, I see now.
{cps=50}Drowned it in wine, so to say.
{cps=50}So yes. My blade is gone. Nowhere to be found now.
{cps=50}Speaking of which, if you help me find some worthy replacement, I'll make it worth your while.
{cps=50}I can put you in touch with the artisan who made this flail for me. And I'll put in a good word for you with him, for he's a serious gentleman — not some village blacksmith who makes horseshoes for mares.
{cps=50}Roger ordered his armor from him before the war. And the size of the fortune that he had to part with for its sake, holy cow...
{cps=50}The man can really afford it, what can I say.
{cps=50}Well, you're not poorly dressed yourself.
{cps=50}It is what it is.
{cps=50}I actually shop there too. Kate, my wife, says that if I ever buy anything from him again for that kind of money, she'll kick me out of the house and I'll have to move to live in this armor.
{cps=50}But you can see that I got the cheapest version — no stones, no jewelry, nothing. It is Roger who has it all embroidered in gold...
{cps=50}And mine is just cheap and cheerful. Though you can't really explain it to a woman...
{cps=50}So yeah. I've been yapping for a while...
{cps=50}Just slip me some decent dagger. And I'll do you a favor.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [secondary_weapon.name]!
{cps=50}This is kind of an abstruse thing.
{cps=50}It's for parrying, I think.
{cps=50}I don't do that kind of crap.
{cps=50}Today you're parrying, tomorrow you're feinting, and then you end up having a walk with some dude on your arm.
{cps=50}It is not for me.
{cps=50}This is some unkind thing. You stab someone with it, and then he'll start appearing in your dreams...
{cps=50}To hell with it!
{cps=50}No, this is rubbish. A bread knife of some kind.
{cps=50}This is some kind of toothpick for dancers.
{cps=50}I'm not interested in such stuff.
{cps=50}Nah, this thing wouldn't penetrate even a sixth of an inch of steel.
{cps=50}Oh, this thing is for feasts.
{cps=50}Feasts are a good thing, thanks for reminding me. But that's not what I asked you for...
{cps=50}Is that a midget's knife?
{cps=50}I've seen some larger midgets, so to say.
{cps=50}I need a knife not for a hunt, but for a war.
{cps=50}Pf-f-ft! This thing won't break through even a puny chainmail!
{cps=50}It's a great piece! Thank you, [name].
{cps=50}Now, look here... On the right bank of the Thames, in the commercial quarter uptown, there is a shop with a sign: 'John Helmschmidt's blacksmithing goods of own production'.
{cps=50}It's small, easy to overlook, but everyone there knows it — if anything, just ask someone.
{cps=50}Tell the owner that you are from me. He always has a lot of orders, but he often makes exceptions for his own.
{cps=50}And the rest is up to you. Good things cost good money, you know.
{cps=50}Just put on some decent clothes. It is uptown, after all. You don't wear rags to a place like that.
{cps=50}Get something more impressive.
{cps=50}Ha! Told you I'd beat you!
{cps=50}I was just out of shape that time. But as you can see, justice has prevailed.
{cps=50}Anyway, it was a good fight. I accepted my defeat with honor — I advise you to do the same.
{cps=50}And if you want a rematch, I'm always at your service!
{cps=50}You're a tough nut to crack, damn it!
{cps=50}Looks like I have to seriously work on myself...
{cps=50}But rest assured, one day I will take a rematch!
{cps=50}As for my word, it is stronger than any steel. Here is your prize. A worthy trophy for winning a fair fight.
{cps=50}Well hello again, [name].
{cps=50}I see you got comfortable here.
{cps=50}Pacing back and forth like you're at home.
{cps=50}You look to me like a man who suffers acutely from idleness.
{cps=50}But don't worry. I'll always find something for you to do.
{cps=50}What have you got there, [name]?
{cps=50}Hey there, [name].
{cps=50}What new assignments do you want, smartass? You're gonna have to deal with what you've got first.
{cps=50}All right, we've dealt with Bristol. Now we are going to Cambridge.
{cps=50}The count wants to win over the sympathy of the duke there, the old fatso Stafford.
{cps=50}He has a grudge that big against Northampton and his company, that there is definitely a potential for a mutually beneficial alliance between us and Cambridge.
{cps=50}But bloody Stafford wouldn't be Stafford if he wasn't a notorious schemer and manipulator.
{cps=50}He is always cheating and being up to something. He has a vested interest in everything.
{cps=50}So you need to keep your ears open. Get ready for this trip properly, because the devil knows what awaits us there.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [old_friends.name!ti].
{cps=50}My informants report that Northampton's men were seen in a village northwest of Greenwich.
{cps=50}You need to go down there, give them a good thrashing, and wean them off sticking their noses out of Dartford.
{cps=50}Grab your cripples and get over there.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added — [greenwich_fight.name!ti].
{cps=50}Got nothing for you yet, [name]. Come by my place a little later.
{cps=50}So what, have you finally stopped doubting me now?
{cps=50}Pf-f-ft. Yes, you've survived the fight with Goliath. But don't play a hero.
{cps=50}Every time he swung his flail, you squealed like a girl.
{cps=50}I squealed like a soldier.
{cps=50}I need help assembling a squad...
{cps=50}And...?
{cps=50}And I thought you might be able to help me in some way.
{cps=50}Well, let's see if there's anyone who wants to do business with you...
{cps=50}Fine.
{cps=50}We'll find someone.
{cps=50}You look like a seasoned warrior, Roger. Can you teach me something?
{cps=50}Teach? You? Ha!
{cps=50}I remember a kid hanging around us during the Welsh campaigns. A young bastard of some viscount or marquis. Can't recall anymore, damn them all.
{cps=50}Anyway, he also kept asking me to teach him something.
{cps=50}As God is my witness, I am not a greedy man — he asked me to teach him something. So I taught him how to roast a boar on charcoal. According to my grandfather's recipe.
{cps=50}At first, of course, he didn't do so well, but by the end of the campaign he had already become a great cook. Could've driven all the servants out of the kitchen and put him there instead.
{cps=50}Then he got stabbed with a spear. When he decided he was a hell of a warrior and joined us in the battle on foot.
{cps=50}This is all, of course, very interesting, Roger. But I'm not sure as to what it has to do with me.
{cps=50}If you keep interrupting me, I'll cut your tongue off.
{cps=50}Now the morale.
{cps=50}And the morale of the story is very simple. You should learn not 'anything', but what could be really useful for you.
{cps=50}So for starters, give both of your remaining gyruses a good strain and decide what exactly you want.
{cps=50}And then, so be it, I'll show you something when I get a chance.
{cps=50}If I see that you're worth spending time on.
{cps=50}I've decided what I want to learn: weapon handling.
{cps=50}Oh, [name], there you are!
{cps=50}Stop wandering around! We've got a lot of work to do.
{cps=50}Get ready. We're going to Bristol.
{cps=50}Why Bristol?
{cps=50}Just because.
{cps=50}Don't ask stupid questions, lad, and we'll easily find a common language.
{cps=50}And if you keep pestering me with all sorts of nonsense, then for every idiotic question I will gently and carefully hit you on the head with a hammer.
{cps=50}And by the end of the road you will either stop talking nonsense or you will forget how to put words into sentences.
{cps=50}Both options suit me fine.
{cps=50}Although that's a lie. I like the second one better.
{cps=50}And why are you standing there like a statue? Come here. The count's waiting for you.
{cps=50}Don't try to boss me around, Roger.
{cps=50}There's only one person I take orders from.{w} And it's not you.
{cps=50}Ha! Really?
{cps=50}You know, Ruffin, I've been putting up with you for a long time, but God knows my patience is about to end.
{cps=50}The count respects you and so I respect you.
{cps=50}But let's not forget that I am a knight.
{cps=50}And you are a dirt under the soles of my sabatons.
{cps=50}So let's get this straight: you do as I say.{w}{vspace=5}Or I will stomp you back into ground where you belong.
{cps=50}A knight, you say...
{cps=50}I visited one knight in Brittany recently.
{cps=50}He was telling me something there, too.{w} Tried to intimidate with something.
{cps=50}But as soon as I drew my sword, he instantly got dramatically sad.
{cps=50}I have my sword with me, Roger.{w} So watch out you don't get dramatically sad too.
{cps=50}After the war?
{cps=50}After the war.
{cps=50}Well, well, well... I'll be damned if that's who I think it is!
{cps=50}Old man Martin himself!
{cps=50}I didn't think I'd ever see you alive again, Sergeant.
{cps=50}And you be well, Roger.
{cps=50}Nice to see you still in one piece.
{cps=50}Your boys are here too, I see.{w} Fletcher, Foster, Maurice.{w}{vspace=5} Maurice, though, doesn't seem to have as many eyes as he did the last time I met him.
{cps=50}Where'd you leave your eye, Maurice?{w}{vspace=5}Don't worry, it'll heal for the wedding!
{cps=50}And where's the lanky one? I keep forgetting his name...
{cps=50}Tom's his name.{w} Was.
{cps=50}He was shot with a crossbow. That winter. During the riots.
{cps=50}That's unfortunate.{w}{vspace=5}He had, like, seven children back home, didn't he?
{cps=50}Yeah.{w} But we don't forget our own, you know that.{w}{vspace=5}Charlotte will always have bread on the table.
{cps=50}We will also accommodate the children as they grow up.{w}{vspace=5}They will not end up being tramps.
{cps=50}I know.{w}{vspace=5}That's why I respect you.
{cps=50}All right, enough reminiscing.
{cps=50}Agreed.{w}{vspace=5}There's no use staring in the past.
{cps=50}Especially if you've only got one eye left, am I right, Maurice?
{cps=50}We are here to make an offer to the Duke of Cambridge from Count Canterbury and the London Parliament.
{cps=50}And you then would like to give him a message from the young prince and the old fox Northampton.
{cps=50}We can go to him together, but you know what he'll tell us then.
{cps=50}So there's only one way out of here.
{cps=50}Only one.
{cps=50}You do know how this is going to end.
{cps=50}You're not young.{w} The days when you could teach me something are long gone.
{cps=50}They are.
{cps=50}But I've got orders.
{cps=50}I see. Orders are orders.{w}{vspace=5}Well, let's see what you've got, old man.
{cps=50}I've been waiting for you to show up, Roger.
{cps=50}But the appearance of the messengers from Northampton surprised me. I didn't think that after all the insults he had inflicted upon me, he would still have the guts to once again appear on my doorstep. Even if not personally.
{cps=50}Therefore, I will not lie: watching this little performance that you threw under my windows, I was rooting for you, Roger.
{cps=50}So congratulations on your victory.
{cps=50}Thank you... sire.
{cps=50}Oh, the young prince should have chosen his allies more carefully. Then he might have not been sitting in Dartford right now...
{cps=50}Well, that's fine. The smarter ones, as they say, will get more.
{cps=50}And those who are very smart will get a whole lot.
{cps=50}I won't waste any time. The count and I have been corresponding for some time now, and he knows my terms.
{cps=50}Northampton is going into exile for life, if he remains alive, of course. His lands — all of them — will be confiscated in my favor.
{cps=50}After becoming king, Canterbury divorces his wife and marries one of my daughters.
{cps=50}The count asked me to tell you that he is willing to accept the offer.
{cps=50}Well, that's great. In that case, you can tell the count that my men will appear near London within the next week.
{cps=50}That's it, gentlemen. I won't keep you. I know you've  probably got your hands full.
{cps=50}The war won't win itself.
{cps=50}...but then shakes his head again and, apologizing, repeats the negative answer.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige - total fail (required: 60)!
{cps=50}...and, after much consideration, declares that he will accept your offer, but the work will have to be paid for at a double rate.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige - neutral result (required: 70)!
{cps=50}Having meticulously examined you from head to toe, he nods his head and declares that he is ready to make an exception for a worthy person.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige - success!
{cps=50}Before accepting your order, the blacksmith also informs you that, due to the escalating war between the parliament and the prince, as well as due to the unprecedented scale of military purchases launched by Canterbury, the entire south of the kingdom is experiencing an acute shortage of materials for the manufacture of armor and weapons.

Good job back there in the woods, [name].
{cps=50}Earned ourselves some dough — fast and easy, just how I like it.
{cps=50}Well, that guy was probably bringing his goods to the Caldwells to sell, so there’s nothing to worry about.
{cps=50}He wanted to sell it to the villains at a higher price, but sold it to the heroes at a lower price. Just as the Bible says.
{cps=50}That was a nice little score, wasn't it, [name]?
{cps=50}You won't get lost with me, so watch and learn.
{cps=50}Well, and the old owner has nothing to complain about - when the Caldwells ran everything here, he was making a fortune from selling his medicines to the locals at enormous prices.

{cps=50}Making some good money, aren't we, [name]?
{cps=50}It's a shame we had to resort to violence, but what can you do...

{cps=50}We've met before. Back in France.
{cps=50}I don't recall, sorry.
{cps=50}Let me help you: the siege of Cambrai.
{cps=50}There were a lot of people in Cambrai.
{cps=50}Your name's Ruffin, you're a mercenary captain.
{cps=50}Former captain. I've left all my men in France.
{cps=50}I am here alone. On some personal business.
{cps=50}And what kind of business might that be?
{cps=50}The kind that is personal and has nothing to do with you.
{cps=50}Speaking about you... I think I do remember you.
{cps=50}That rookie brat with a bunch of ragamuffin militiamen friends foraging through the villages around Cambrai.
{cps=50}You were trying to tell me off.
{cps=50}You've killed innocents.
{cps=50}I've killed a lot of people.{w} Both before and after that.
{cps=50}You, I think, have too.
{cps=50}They weren't warriors!
{cps=50}Enough. Spare me your tears.
{cps=50}I’m ready to cut your throat right now, but the count has imposed a strict ban on any duels or violent personal conflicts in wartime.
{cps=50}So we'll have to wait until the campaign is over.
{cps=50}Try to bring the same energy next time we meet.
{cps=50}It'll be a shame for you to wait all this time only to immediately collapse after one swing of my sword.
{cps=50}You again?
{cps=50}Came for your revenge, I reckon.
{cps=50}Well, since I am no longer in the service of the count - then I see no obstacles in letting you have what you want.
{cps=50}I'm in a bit of a hurry, so you'll have to forgive me if the whole thing takes a bit quicker than you expected.

{cps=50}You've done enough to prove yourself to us, [name].
{cps=50}I won't lie, assigning you one task after another, I was absolutely sure that this time you would definitely screw up or make a mess.
{cps=50}But it looks like I was mistaken.
{cps=50}It looks like you have a pretty solid grasp on what you're doing. This is a rare quality these days - so it is in our interests to make sure that you're well armed and well armored.
{cps=50}As you know, it's not easy to get good equipment in the capital right now - everything is sold out months in advance. But there are always options for our own.
{cps=50}Stop by this workshop here and tell them you're from me. You'll be dressed and armed to the highest standards.
{cps=50}You can get suckered to the highest standards there too though - so watch your purse.
{cps=50}The Scots are advancing rapidly towards the capital, [name].
{cps=50}According to the count's scouts, their advance detachments were already spotted in the vicinity of Cambridge.
{cps=50}The last thing we need is to let Stafford get reinforcements from the Scots - then we might not be able to smoke him out of his castle at all.
{cps=50}The count has already given the order to prepare to march. The troops are assembled, but it will definitely take a couple of days to load the wagons - use this time to clear the way for us and make sure that the Scots do not get to Cambridge before we do.
{cps=50}Cleared the way already? Great job!
{cps=50}As a reward, I'll give you a couple of helpful tips. I noticed some gaps in your technique back when you fought Goliath.
{cps=50}Now listen up...
{cps=50}Now, that's a different story. Well done, you're quick on the uptake.

{cps=50}Seeing that the plan to capture Chippenham is falling apart right before your eyes, you make the only right decision - to retreat.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[storyroll!ti] militiamen lost!
{cps=50}In all honesty, I could not even imagine that our plan could fail.
{cps=50}You know well how dangerous Duncan is - and now we've made him realize that there's no escaping from the past. I don't think he's going to let it go.
{cps=50}We must put an end to this story. Because if we won't, Duncan will do it instead.
{cps=50}I understand, Alyssa.
{cps=50}After what happened, he will be doubly vigilant and the castle guards will surely be beefed up. Taking Chippenham would now require a small army.
{cps=50}So the final solution of the Duncan issue will have to be postponed until after the conclusion of the war with Canterbury.
{cps=50}And what do you suggest I do in the meantime? Just sit tight and pray that he won't show up here with his goons while my future husband settles his more important matters?
{cps=50}My people will secure Greenwich.
{cps=50}But what about...
{cps=50}Alyssa. Enough.
{cps=50}We tried following your plan and only got ourselves into a lot of trouble. Now we're going to do it my way.
{cps=50}I'll get him. And I'll see to it that you are well protected.
{cps=50}I like it when you take matters into your own hands.
{cps=50}Have it your way. I'm not used to being a damsel in distress, but I'm willing to try myself in this role.
{cps=50}I hope I won't come to regret it.
{cps=50}[name]! What a surprise!
{cps=50}And I was just about to suggest you stop the bloodshed and talk - as befits a decent nobleman.
{cps=50}Any problem can be solved with gold, right? Here. There are twenty thousand florins.
{cps=50}That should be enough to settle all our disagreements.
{cps=50}We've got a deal?
{cps=50}I'll take the money.
{cps=50}Well, that's great.
{cps=50}And I'll take your life as well.
{cps=50}No.{w} No deal.
{cps=50}After capturing the castle and dealing with Duncan, you send a messenger to Alyssa, and the next day Chippenham meets its new marquis.
{cps=50}Sounds like a large venture! And how shall we do that?! And where shall we get this?!
{cps=50}If this kingdom ever gets a town by the name of 'Toldyouso', I should become its mayor.
{cps=50}You were right about everything. I take it all back.
{cps=50}Speaking of the kingdom.
{cps=50}Who do you think is the most powerful man in England right now?
{cps=50}Prince Edward. He is a brave and honorable man, and royal blood runs in his veins.
{cps=50}The coalition he's assembled is capable of winning the war for the crown.
{cps=50}The earl. This old fox has plans for all occasions.
{cps=50}At first glance his ideas seem delusional, but luck always smiles on him.
{cps=50}Back in Dartford loyalists were doing worse than ever, and yet he managed to wriggle out of a desperate situation.
{cps=50}And now that Prince Edward has half the kingdom on his side, Northampton cannot be outplayed.
{cps=50}He is the grey eminence behind the young prince's back and he is the most powerful man in the kingdom.
{cps=50}Count Canterbury. His resources seem limitless, and his plans are cunning and sophisticated.
{cps=50}Every time I think we've beaten him - be it under London or at Windsor - he comes back even stronger.
{cps=50}Duke of Cambridge. Apparently, it is he who will have the final say in the coming conclusion of the war for the crown.
{cps=50}Presently, he is the man who will determine the fate of the kingdom.
{cps=50}Interesting. But I have a different opinion.
{cps=50}What if I told you that currently the most powerful man in the kingdom is...
{cps=50}[name].
{cps=50}You're the link between London and Hadley. Between London and Chippenham. Between the loyalist group and the Duke of Cambridge.
{cps=50}You speak with the lords on behalf of the crown, and they make agreements with you, entrusting their troops to you.
{cps=50}Resources of Chippenham and Hadley are in your hands.
{cps=50}The army that stands beneath the walls of Windsor, hardened in the battles for the town, is obeying you personally because it was you who assembled it and led it into battle.
{cps=50}There are not that many troops at Windsor...
{cps=50}But you have carte blanche to assemble them. The prince and the earl have allowed you to create your own army - and in part, at their expense.
{cps=50}It would be strange not to take advantage of this opportunity.
{cps=50}What are you getting at?
{cps=50}Weeell... If you already do all the work for the prince and the earl - negotiating, forming alliances, gathering armies, and storming key towns, then...
{cps=50}Why not just take it one step further.
{cps=50}And do all the same things, but with a crown on your head and without listening to someone else's instructions?
{cps=50}You... suggest...
{cps=50}I suggest you become king.
{cps=50}Agreeing to this proposition means betraying Prince Edward, the rightful heir to God's chosen king.
{cps=50}I can't go through with this.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}I have no thirst for power and no desire to plow my way over the heads of others to the top... Just to, surely, plummet off it and crash to the ground right after.
{cps=50}I started at the very bottom and had nothing to offer the earl and the prince, save for my sword and my loyalty.
{cps=50}They gave me a chance, and now, thanks to them, I'm a knight with my own banner. And, in case of victory over Canterbury, a potential landowner.
{cps=50}I have already accomplished more than anyone in my family has even dared to dream of.
{cps=50}So I'm not going to plunge a dagger into the backs of those who once pulled me out of the mud and are now regularly putting money in my pocket.
{cps=50}They're using you, [name]. You are but a mere piece on their chessboard. One of the many bargaining chips that both Northampton and the young prince will not hesitate to give up for the opportunity to sit on the throne.
{cps=50}That might be so. But what's wrong with that?
{cps=50}Peasants work in the fields. Monks pray. Kings reign.
{cps=50}And knights fight and die.
{cps=50}I am a knight, Alyssa. Everything is as it should be.
{cps=50}Goddamn...
{cps=50}Ah, to hell with it.
{cps=50}Then I'll stay a countess.
{cps=50}I promise you: we'll grow grey and old, yet I'll still be reminding you of this conversation.
{cps=50}Were you a man I loved even a bit less, one of my servants would have thrust a spoke in your throat by now.
{cps=50}Well then... It's good that you love me so much, right?
{cps=50}Pffft...
{cps=50}You'll get me a lavish dress for the wedding. And an expensive Arabian horse. Let your friends the earl and the prince pay up.
{cps=50}I'll ride from Greenwich to Chippenham and dream of what a queen I could've been.
{cps=50}I love you, [name]. But give me some time.
{cps=50}I need to get really drunk.
{cps=50}Agreeing to this proposition means becoming a master of destinies. Ascending the highest peak available to man.
{cps=50}The old king was foolish and inconsiderate and, as a result, plunged these lands into chaos. The young prince gives nice speeches, but continues to drown England in the blood of internecine wars.
{cps=50}A bit more and there will be nothing left of the kingdom at all.
{cps=50}You say that Prince Edward was chosen by the Lord as king. But is that really true?
{cps=50}He was not anointed to reign. His father died an ignominious death, and his own subjects turned their backs on him.
{cps=50}The kingdom the prince 'inherited' from his father is crumbling like a sand castle. Prince Edward's true power extends only to the confines of the capital, where he is forced to take refuge while waiting for others to win his war for him.
{cps=50}He is a king without a crown. A king without power. A king without a kingdom.
{cps=50}Now look at you. Chosen by Fate itself, a man from nowhere, who by his own valor and fearlessness has earned himself a place beside the powers that be. A man to whom the prince and the earl, ironically, have entrusted great power that they could not bear.
{cps=50}What is it if not a sign? You have been chosen by the Lord.
{cps=50}You should be the new king.
{cps=50}You've saved the prince in the streets of Cambrai, you've been the first on the wall during the second assault, you've broken through the French defenses and allowed the royal troops to finally take the city.
{cps=50}Your authority among the soldiers[player_personally_attacked_windsor!ti] your words enough weight to motivate men to follow you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) check passed!{vspace=5}All soldiers ([windsor_militiamen_gathered]) are ready to follow you to London!
{cps=50}Without much authority among the soldiers, you are unable to give your words enough weight to motivate them to follow you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) check failed!
{cps=50}As a result, when you advance on London, quite a few soldiers desert along the way, leaving you with a much more modest force than what you were counting on.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[kingdom_of_london_army] soldiers have agreed to follow you to London!
{cps=50}Since you have eliminated several Northampton's representatives that were present in the camp, assigned to you to report to the earl on the progress of the siege, in advance, you achieve a relative element of surprise and reach London with its gates open and completely unprepared for any kind of defense.
{cps=50}What is this supposed to mean, [name]?
{cps=50}Decided to switch to Canterbury's side?
{cps=50}No, sire. To my own.
{cps=50}There's nothing as intoxicating as the imaginary proximity to power. You stand at the throne and think that all you have to do is take one step - and it is yours.
{cps=50}Yet sometimes the intoxication is so severe that even one step becomes impossible.
{cps=50}And pride comes before a fall.
{cps=50}I am firm in my step. The time of old kings and dynasties has passed. My hour has struck.
{cps=50}Have it your way.
{cps=50}Put your weapon away, Prince. Your life is not in jeopardy yet. I'm here to arrest you.
{cps=50}How little you know about kings, [name].
{cps=50}That's not how it works.{w}{vspace=5}The crown comes off only along with the head.
{cps=50}Remember this - or you might be in for a surprise later.
{cps=50}Your fine reputation and the fact that your name is currently on everyone's lips, even among the nobility, lead most lords whose troops are part of the loyalist army to remain on your side and agree to obey orders from London.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige, Reputation check passed!
{cps=50}The poor reputation and obscurity of your name among the nobility cause a substantial number of lords whose troops are part of the loyalist army to recall their detachments and refuse to obey London in any matter whatsoever.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige, Reputation check failed!
{cps=50}As for the peasants and common townsfolk, now that you are the most discussed person in the kingdom, they quickly become privy to all the details of your deeply pious behavior and sincerely devout character.
{cps=50}As for the peasants and common townsfolk, now that you are the most discussed person in the kingdom, they quickly become privy to all the details of your impious character and behavior, the rumors of which spread everywhere no worse than those paid for by Alyssa.
london
{cps=50}Word has reached London that Count Canterbury's troops have set off towards the capital. Scouts report that his forces are estimated at around [kingdom_of_london_canterburys_army] men. You have approximately [kingdom_of_london_army!ti] men at your disposal...
{cps=50}Having the numerical advantage, the attackers force you into an unequal battle, and many defenders of London, including you, quickly end up wounded and exhausted from the battle.
{cps=50}Perfectly prepared for the siege, the London garrison steadily fends off the attackers, and you realize that the enemy forces won't last long...
{cps=50}Congratulations on another victory, my hero!
{cps=50}The news of the rebels' defeat inflicted by you under London has already reached me, but I would be very happy to hear a detailed retelling of this story from your lips.
{cps=50}One second. I'll have the servants bring the best wine from the cellar.
{cps=50}A triumph of such magnitude should be celebrated with something special!
{cps=50}Thanks for the congratulations, Alyssa, but it might be better to hold off on the wine a little.
{cps=50}Canterbury has been routed and the capital is now in our hands, but the definitive victory is still a long way off.
{cps=50}Oh? Is that so?
{cps=50}And here I was told that Canterbury had allegedly died in battle and that all his rebels had dropped their weapons and scattered in the surrounding woods.
{cps=50}So these rumors are, as usual, somewhat exaggerated...
{cps=50}Exaggerated. And not even somewhat.
{cps=50}As I said, we did manage to take advantage of the count's troops' disorganization and inflict a defeat, forcing him to abandon the capital.
{cps=50}However, the rebels are still very far from being completely defeated.
{cps=50}To our knowledge, Canterbury has withdrawn to Oxford and is now once again assembling forces there from his vast reserves.
{cps=50}Northampton says seizing London has been extremely fortunate for us, and the count will not make us a second such gift.
{cps=50}So we all have challenging times ahead.
{cps=50}Hm. So that's how it is...
{cps=50}You know, I might appear overly materialistic in your eyes, but...
{cps=50}But maybe this outcome of events isn't all that bad for us.
{cps=50}Well, why not?
{cps=50}Thanks to the war, you've become a knight, met me, and sat at the same table with the crown prince himself - a soon-to-be King.
{cps=50}War is a time of opportunity. Especially for people like you.
{cps=50}And now you'll have me on your side as well.
{cps=50}And, as we have already seen from the story of the Sheriff and his crony Duncan, your sword and my smarts are a formidable combination.
{cps=50}So now we'll be able to not just take advantage of opportunities, but squeeze the absolute maximum out of them.
{cps=50}Sounds extremely promising. Especially if you don't think about the fact that war is also a possibility of being impaled with a spear or a sword at any moment.
{cps=50}Pfft. Nonsense. Scars adorn a man, [name].
{cps=50}And so do titles, lands, and gold.
{cps=50}And while you're already doing great with the former, the rest can obviously still be worked on.
{cps=50}But don't worry. I'll take care of it.
{cps=50}If we're indeed in the middle of splitting a big pie called the Kingdom of England, why shouldn't we take a good bite out of it ourselves?
{cps=50}I don't know what's on your mind, but I think we should be wary.
{cps=50}Trying to outsmart the crooked Sheriff is one thing. Getting involved in the intrigues surrounding the royal throne is quite another.
{cps=50}The war has indeed provided me with many opportunities, but I've been able to not miss out on them by following one simple principle.
{cps=50}Do what I'm told and mind my own business.
{cps=50}I don't think it would be wise to conspire behind the backs of such people as the earl and the prince.
{cps=50}God, you're such a bore! I can't even daydream with you around.
{cps=50}You can relax, I'm not going to drag you into anything. After all, your health and well-being are also in my best interests.
{cps=50}So I'll just stick to helpful advice. It's up to you whether you'll follow it or not.
{cps=50}Hadley, Chippenham, and Cambridge, then? With the right to conduct negotiations on behalf of the crown prince himself... Interesting.
{cps=50}If you consider each of these assignments separately, it might seem like you're entrusted solely with courier work.
{cps=50}But if you put them all together...
{cps=50}Then it will turn out that you are none other than the chief diplomat in the entire kingdom.
{cps=50}And your actions and decisions will shape the alliances that will resolve the outcome of this war.
{cps=50}It would be a sin not to take advantage of such opportunities...
{cps=50}All that's left is to figure out how it can be done.
{cps=50}What's on your mind?
{cps=50}Nothing specific yet. As you well know, my own home was under siege by brigands and bandits until recently — so I didn't care much about the rest of the kingdom...
{cps=50}...and I'm going to need some time to get more familiar with the global balance of power and the state of affairs.
{cps=50}But don't worry, I'll handle this whole part.
{cps=50}Just please keep me informed.
{cps=50}And don't forget that the Greenwich arsenal is always available for you.
{cps=50}Also... I rarely mention it, but that doesn't mean I don't think about it...
{cps=50}Be careful.
{cps=50}I am asking you as my future husband.
{cps=50}Bloody bastard... I can't believe it.
{cps=50}So not only is he alive — although I saw him burn at the stake with my own eyes — but he's also managed to take over Chippenham and become the marquis there?!
{cps=50}Unbelievable.
{cps=50}I shall not let this stand.
{cps=50}We shall not let this stand.
{cps=50}Since this moron was foolish enough to threaten the life of a representative of the prince himself, our hands are untied.
{cps=50}Do you see what I'm getting at?
{cps=50}I do, but Northampton has ordered to delay the Duncan issue until after the war.
{cps=50}The current primary objective is to ensure victory over Canterbury without being distracted by secondary goals.
{cps=50}First he tried to kill me and my family, now he has personally insulted you and almost took your life, and you're... willing to turn a blind eye to all this?
{cps=50}I am not turning a blind eye to any of this, but at the moment I have clear orders - to focus on Canterbury.
{cps=50}Don't make me choose between you and my duty.
{cps=50}I promise you: once Canterbury is dealt with, I will personally handle Duncan - and he will not survive a second burning at the stake.
{cps=50}I understand. But the circumstances are not on our side right now.
{cps=50}I'm willing to set out for Chippenham for Duncan's head immediately. But the reality is that he's no longer an outlaw holed up in a dugout — now he sits behind thick stone walls with crossbowmen and vats of boiling tar at the ready.
{cps=50}It won't be possible to hold him accountable with just half a dozen men on hand.
{cps=50}To deal with Duncan, it would be necessary to divert substantial forces away from the confrontation with the rebels.
{cps=50}Everyone in Oxford would be jumping for joy.
{cps=50}You underestimate me, [name].
{cps=50}I'm not a fool to demand that you sabotage the campaign against Canterbury with another war on the home front.
{cps=50}Instead, I propose to deal with Duncan in one precise strike and, if all goes well, to ‘replace’ him with someone more... ‘favorable’.
{cps=50}Favorable for us.
{cps=50}As far as I can tell from your story — if Northampton and Prince Edward were willing to deal with a former brigand, they are in no position to be picky about allies.
{cps=50}They need soldiers for the war. And as long as Chippenham supplies them with those soldiers, they won't care much about who is running the place.
{cps=50}So in the end, if we pull it all off carefully, we can settle scores with Duncan, put our own man in the marquis's chair, and at the same time avoid incurring the prince's wrath.
{cps=50}I am not sure I follow you, Alyssa.
{cps=50}Just now we were talking about holding Duncan accountable for his crimes.
{cps=50}And now you suggest... to get our hands on Chippenham?
{cps=50}Despite his past, Duncan is now effectively a full-fledged marquis, and both the earl and the prince see him as a valuable ally in the war against Canterbury.
{cps=50}And showdowns between allies during the war are a bad idea.
{cps=50}This man tried to kill me and my family, as well as loot and burn my home.
{cps=50}After miraculously escaping justice at Greenwich, he proceeded to perpetrate atrocities at Chippenham and took the life of a marquis there, appropriating his castle, land, and title.
{cps=50}Devil only knows what else he has in mind and where he'll turn his murderous gaze tomorrow.
{cps=50}And there's certainly no guarantee that his men won't appear here again one day with weapons in their hands.
{cps=50}Yet you're suggesting we just forget everything he's done?
{cps=50}I won't feel at peace as long as I know Duncan is still alive...
{cps=50}Alyssa, we can't just launch a war against our own allies right now.
{cps=50}Especially against those deemed valuable by the prince and the earl.
{cps=50}I know how you feel. But don't make me choose between you and my duty.
{cps=50}You tell me you don't wish to choose between me and your duty... But you did just make a choice.
{cps=50}And not in my favor.
{cps=50}Quiet. You've said enough.
{cps=50}If Northampton's and Prince Edward's opinions matter so much to you, why don't you marry one of them?
{cps=50}I'm certain you'd make a great couple.
{cps=50}I know how you feel, but the circumstances are not on our side right now.
{cps=50}Calling Duncan to account would mean declaring war on one of our own allies.
{cps=50}As far as I can tell from your story — Northampton and Prince Edward are in no position to be picky about allies.
{cps=50}You are a master of sweet talk, Alyssa, and in theory your plan does look quite feasible.
{cps=50}But I'm afraid it all is going to be much more complicated in practice.
{cps=50}How exactly are we supposed to deliver a ‘precise strike’ to someone hiding behind the walls of a guarded castle?
{cps=50}Where do we find ‘our own man’ whom we can then make the new marquis?
{cps=50}All this sounds like a large venture...
{cps=50}Hey! Cheer up! 'Those not taking risks get no Burgundy for their fair wives to drink.'
{cps=50}You're not blind, [name], and should be able to see it all for yourself. Northampton and Edward are spinning like a weathervane in the wind.
{cps=50}Yesterday they needed my father's favor, so you were assigned to run around me.
{cps=50}Today Duncan became important to them, so all his yesterday's transgressions — including those committed against me and my father — were immediately forgotten.
{cps=50}The same will happen to you. You get the bare minimum, crumbs from their table — and even that is only because they need your sword now.
{cps=50}As soon as Canterbury is defeated and the young prince is comfortably settled on the throne, you will be forgotten and discarded like an old useless toy.
{cps=50}Your cunning and courage helped them drive the rebels from London, and what did you get in return? The right to your own banner and a handful of coins that won't even get you a set of good armor?
{cps=50}You're a great soldier, [name], but if you don't want to be someone's errand boy for the rest of your life, you need to start thinking with your head.
{cps=50}I won't let them exploit you for a pittance.
{cps=50}Now, regarding Duncan. The late Marquis of Chippenham had a quite extensive family with dozens of close and distant relatives scattered throughout the south of the kingdom.
{cps=50}The marquis was not known for his generosity, so many of his kin are likely to lead quite poor lives.
{cps=50}All we need to do is find one of them — preferably someone not too adequate — and make him an offer he can't refuse.
{cps=50}And then, once Duncan has been dealt with, declare him the rightful heir to the marquis, restoring the deposed dynasty on its rightful domain.
{cps=50}The new marquis — ideally some drunkard second uncle of the late one — will keep drinking quietly, but in his own apartment and surrounded by servants.
{cps=50}The actual governance of Chippenham will be handled by us through one of my men assigned to the new marquis.
{cps=50}And after the end of the war, in a year or two, our new marquis may well suddenly die of an exacerbation of some disease... After leaving behind a will, of course.
{cps=50}Anyway, don't worry about it - I'll think it all through.
{cps=50}You've got solely military matters at hand: devise a plan to infiltrate Duncan's residence without a long siege and begin preparations.
{cps=50}Let me know when everything's ready. I'll take care of the rest.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [overthrow.name!ti].
{cps=50}Aldous Mortimer!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Alyssa exclaims in your direction as if casting a spell.
{cps=50}It is all just as we wanted. Aldous Mortimer is a second uncle of John Mortimer, the late Marquis of Radcliffe, from whom Duncan snatched the castle.
{cps=50}Old Aldous lives in London and frequents multiple city pubs.
{cps=50}Before John Mortimer's disgrace he had been a rather prosperous merchant, but the old king, after his conflict with John, had gone through their entire family with fire and sword.
{cps=50}John went into exile to Chippenham, while Aldous and a few other relatives were bankrupted. In favor of the royal treasury, naturally.
{cps=50}Today, the poor fellow is mostly busy drinking away what little is left of his fortune and slowly losing his human form.
{cps=50}So we don't have much time - for phrenitis might claim him any day now, judging by the stories.
{cps=50}Sounds like the perfect marquis candidate.
{cps=50}What about Duncan's elimination? Are you ready to act?
{cps=50}I have several ideas.
{cps=50}Excellent. Then don't delay and get started right away.
{cps=50}My men will handle Aldous and prepare him for his triumphant return to liberated Chippenham.
{cps=50}I'll await your signal. Good luck and be careful.
{cps=50}Hello. Glad to see you again.
{cps=50}Thank you! Now I can feel at least a little bit more at ease...
{cps=50}Hmmm... If you can't get there directly, you might want to look for some alternative way.
{cps=50}Remember the time you infiltrated the Sheriff's residence disguised as a tax collector?
{cps=50}Yes, I recall it.
{cps=50}There you go. Why not try something similar here as well...
{cps=50}And who should I pretend to be to enter plague-ridden lands?
{cps=50}The answer is on the surface.
{cps=50}Where there is a fire, a man with a bucket of water is welcome. Where there is war, a man with a weapon is expected.
{cps=50}And where there is an epidemic, there is surely a demand for healers.
{cps=50}Sounds logical. All that remains is to figure out exactly how to do it...
{cps=50}Well, you could, of course, go someplace to study the medical craft. To Oxford, for instance.
{cps=50}But that's not a quick matter, so it would take you about five years to get to Hadley that way - and that's the best-case scenario.
{cps=50}So I recommend you just dress as a healer.
{cps=50}I will do just that. Thanks for the advice.
{cps=50}Anything for you, darling.

Send Alyssa the men to reinforce Greenwich's security
Tell Alyssa about the situation in Hadley
{cps=50}Resources of Chippenham and Greenwich are in your hands.
{cps=50}[name], how great of you to stop by.
{cps=50}I've heard some interesting rumors about your affairs in Chippenham.
{cps=50}Is there something you want to tell me?
{cps=50}This was revenge on Duncan, sire. That scoundrel had threatened Alyssa's life and, after all he had done, I couldn't let him stay alive.
{cps=50}Chippenham is now under my complete control, so this won't interfere with our plans anyhow.
{cps=50}Won't interfere anyhow, you say?
{cps=50}Well, I'm glad to hear it, [name].
{cps=50}Now sit down and listen to me. And listen very carefully.
{cps=50}You're doing well in this war - I appreciate your contribution to our common cause and am even willing to turn a blind eye to some of the things you're doing behind my back.
{cps=50}But don't forget your place.
{cps=50}I pulled you out of the mud and lifted you off the ground fairly high. And I have plans to lift you even higher.
{cps=50}But I can also throw you back down.
{cps=50}And I hope you realize that people usually don't survive falls from such heights.
{cps=50}The secret to the success of our teamwork, [name], is that I make plans and you execute them.
{cps=50}Let's not break this well-oiled machine. Especially at a time like this...
{cps=50}You can trust me, sire. I won't let you down.
{cps=50}I certainly hope so, [name].{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check passed!
{cps=50}I...{w} Trust you, [name].{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check failed!
{cps=50}But just so you won't get too dizzy from all the excess power, why don't you relinquish some of your cumbersome duties?
{cps=50}Tomorrow I will send Thomas Marshall to Windsor to take over command of the town and the camp. He will proceed with the recruitment on his own.
{cps=50}And you just focus on Cambridge.
{cps=50}And you just stay in London and await further assignments. I might find something for you yet.
{cps=50}And, [name], - no more spontaneous antics.
{cps=50}You can trust me, sire. And I intend to prove it.
{cps=50}Count Caldwell's daughter has plotted treachery and proposed me to seize London and usurp the throne, relying on the forces of Greenwich, Chippenham, and Windsor.
{cps=50}And I take it you weren't tempted by that offer?
{cps=50}I don't want riches and glory at the cost of my own honor.
{cps=50}I love money, but I would be a fool to try to bite off the hand that feeds me.
{cps=50}I took an oath of allegiance to you and Prince Edward, and I'm not going to break it.
{cps=50}Great to hear that.
{cps=50}Truth be told, I was starting to have slight doubts regarding your loyalty, but I'm glad you made the right choice.
{cps=50}You don't have to worry about the girl - my men will arrest her.
{cps=50}I don't know how serious your feelings for her were, but you'd better erase her name from your memory because no one will ever hear of her again.
{cps=50}I'm glad the de Roche story has taught you something. That's good to see.
{cps=50}Never let feelings get in the way of your duty, [name].
{cps=50}This simple rule can save a lot of trouble.
{cps=50}Many decent men have ruined themselves because of women. It's a pleasure doing business with a man who doesn't forget his duty because of his feelings.
{cps=50}It was the perfect plan!{vspace=5}You were to be king and I was to be queen!
{cps=50}We were to subjugate the entire kingdom and then rule happily ever after, going down in the chronicles forever.
{cps=50}It was the perfect plan...
{cps=50}Just look on the bright side. Maybe it's all for the best.
{cps=50}After all, I don't think I'd make such a good king.
{cps=50}I am a knight, not a politician.
{cps=50}And a knight ought to fight bravely and be faithful to his suzerain.
{cps=50}And something tells me it's better to be a good knight than a bad king.
{cps=50}But not as king of England, but as king of the newly formed Kingdom of London, which includes the capital with its outskirts, Greenwich, Chippenham[storyroll!ti], and other domains loyal to you, whose lords are willing to swear allegiance to the new sovereign.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Health decreased by [health_roll]!{vspace=5}All characteristics decreased by [all_stats_roll]!{vspace=5}Fatigue increased by [fatigue_roll]!
{cps=50}Pursuing any possible means to damage Canterbury's troops, you send a saboteur into their camp, instructing him to [kingdom_of_london_diversion!ti].{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}5000 florins lost!
{cps=50}Your agent manages to carry out the task, and the count's troops take significant casualties.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Canterbury lost [kingdom_of_london_diversion] soldiers!
{cps=50}According to the scouts, Canterbury's troops that have withdrawn to Oxford numbered about [kingdom_of_london_canterburys_army] men and are expected to be reinforced with about a thousand or two more reservists in the near future. So a campaign against Canterbury would be meaningless unless you can field at least 7000 soldiers.
{cps=50}There he is, our little Judas.{w}{vspace=5}The jester king of the clownish kingdom.
{cps=50}How is it going back in London, [name]? Does the crown fit you?
{cps=50}Oh, pardon me. I've completely forgotten...{w}{vspace=5}You don't even have one.
{cps=50}One can pull a peasant out of crap, but not the crap out of a peasant.
{cps=50}Watch your tongue, Earl.{w}{vspace=5}Or you just might follow the prince.
{cps=50}You speak to the king, so kindly show proper respect.
{cps=50}The only kind of respect we are willing to show you, my ungrateful friend, lies in providing you with an offer to cease this disgusting farce voluntarily, lay down your arms, and accept a quick merciful death.
{cps=50}And when I say 'we' - I mean everyone present here.
{cps=50}You've got no friends sitting at this table.
{cps=50}If I recall correctly, we agreed to gather here to engage in a dialogue and seek mutual understanding, not to hurl threats and ultimatums.
{cps=50}That is correct, [name]. We have gathered here to engage in a dialogue and seek mutual understanding.
{cps=50}And we have found it.{w} The three of us.
{cps=50}Which is why we are now making you an offer on behalf of all of us.
{cps=50}You put an end to this buffoonery with the Kingdom of London, lay down your arms, get your head chopped off quickly and painlessly, and it's all over.
{cps=50}And your wench, so be it, will keep her life.
{cps=50}She will have her poisonous tongue cut out and then live out her life in some monastery in the fringes of the kingdom.
{cps=50}Given the magnitude of her atrocities - it's far from the worst ending.
{cps=50}Listen, [name]...
{cps=50}As far as I understand, you're not the most experienced person in state affairs, are you?
{cps=50}So heed my advice...
{cps=50}This is the best deal you can hope for.
{cps=50}All the alternatives - and trust me, there are plenty - are far less pleasant.
{cps=50}No one here has much sympathy for each other.
{cps=50}However, if there is any matter in this world on which we have no disagreement with each other...{w} it is the question of what we are to do with you and your...
{cps=50}Kingdom of London.
{cps=50}You can't beat the three of us alone. London will fall. And when it does - a quick and painless death will be your and the Caldwell girl's only wish.
{cps=50}Well then...
{cps=50}Looks like we're not going to reach an agreement.
{cps=50}It's been a pleasure doing business with you, gentlemen.
{cps=50}With the support of your new personal friend James Bruce, you resolve this matter in your favor, successfully organizing the wedding of the duke's daughter with one of your loyal men, who is your old friend, as well as a handsome and prominent heartthrob - knight [ally!ti].
{cps=50}With the support of your new personal friend James Bruce, you prevent Canterbury from taking over the duchy and organize the wedding of the duke's daughter with one of your vassals.
{cps=50}In an effort to replenish your depleted coffers, you announce an extraordinary tax collection.
{cps=50}Your reputation, however, mitigates some of the negative sentiment and prevents mass discontent.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Popularity (peasants) check passed!{vspace=5}Popularity (peasants) decreased!

{cps=50}You issue a call for volunteers for a new military campaign.

{cps=50}Due to your lack of popularity among the lower class, almost no one responds to your call.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Popularity (peasants) check failed!{vspace=5}The number of troops has been increased by [storyroll]!
{cps=50}Or should I say - greetings, Your Majesty.
{cps=50}I know that both Northampton and the late Canterbury would consider it beneath their dignity to utter these words, but I have no problem accepting reality.
{cps=50}And the reality is that you're doing surprisingly well as monarch.
{cps=50}I appreciate the compliment, Duke.
{cps=50}People speak of you as an intelligent and open-minded person. I am sure that we will find common ground.
{cps=50}Indubitably.
{cps=50}I am not the kind of person who would tear a kingdom apart only to get his own piece so that he could - just like a rooster on the perch - sit there and boast about his importance and superiority.
{cps=50}England's strength lies in the strict hierarchy of power and the unity of its lands. The actions of the old king and his good-for-nothing son have led to the loss of both.
{cps=50}And in you, I see someone who can correct this unfortunate oversight.
{cps=50}An alliance between London and Cambridge would restore most of the kingdom within its old borders under your control.
{cps=50}Northampton holds only a narrow strip of land on the south coast — he's a cunning fox, but he won't stand a chance against the two of us.
{cps=50}And once he's off the chessboard, there will be no one left to challenge you for the crown. And you'll come out of this war as the victor.
{cps=50}There is still the Scottish issue in the north, of course, but their new king is young and inexperienced, so that's a lock I'll find the keys for.
{cps=50}These are all very bright prospects, Duke. But I have yet to hear the most important thing — what is the price of your loyalty?
{cps=50}Your marriage to my daughter. And my appointment as your right-hand man.
{cps=50}I know that you are engaged in a 'relationship' with Alyssa Caldwell, but you yourself should understand that at this stage that alliance has no prospects.
{cps=50}Big politics is a team game, [name]. And the greater your ambitions, the more serious your partners should be.
{cps=50}Face the facts. Yes, you've defeated Canterbury, but neither Cambridge nor Maidstone are yet part of your kingdom. And meanwhile the northern lands are being snatched by the Scots.
{cps=50}This war is far from over. And you might still slip up.
{cps=50}So choose wisely.
{cps=50}I'm willing to make you my right hand, Duke, but I already have a bride.
{cps=50}However, I am confident that together we will be able to find an excellent match for your daughter - there are many worthy men among my friends and allies.
{cps=50}I'm afraid my terms are not up for debate, [name]. It's all or nothing.
{cps=50}In that case, my answer is no.
{cps=50}That's a very... imprudent decision.
{cps=50}One that you might come to regret...
{cps=50}Are you threatening me, Duke?
{cps=50}I'm not some highwayman to make threats to anyone.
{cps=50}But I wish to put one very simple idea in your head...
{cps=50}On the way to Greenwich, you are intercepted by a courier with an urgent message from the earl, informing you of an unexpected rebel advance on Windsor, a small town just next to the capital.
{cps=50}As far as I can tell from your story, Northampton and Prince Edward need allies. Need them so badly that they're even willing to make generous offers to yesterday's brigands.
{cps=50}And if it so happens that an alliance with Chippenham cannot be achieved through diplomatic means, then we will simply reach the same goal through other methods.
{cps=50}And everyone will be satisfied.
{cps=50}The prince gains a valuable new ally, and Northampton accomplishes his assignment. While we not only settle the score with Duncan, but also gain control of Chippenham with our own man in the marquis's chair.
{cps=50}The sheep are safe, and the wolves are fed.
{cps=50}Alyssa, I need help assembling the troops.
{cps=50}Once again, I realize how lucky you are to have me. Because I haven't been sitting idle all this time...
{cps=50}I haven't been sitting idle all this time either, by the way.
{cps=50}Now that the peasant uprising is over and the rebels have been driven away from London, Greenwich is far away from all the fighting, so I've been able to set up some operations here.
{cps=50}Well-well...
{cps=50}I suspected you'd need more men - and in large numbers.{vspace=5}So I started forming...{w} the Greenwich militia!
{cps=50}Sounds quite belligerent.
{cps=50}You bet. I wouldn't count on any countless hordes of warriors, of course, but I certainly could materialize a few dozen — or maybe even a hundred — fighters.
{cps=50}Let me guess. You've got the manpower, and all you're missing is the equipment? I'm afraid I can't help you with that much.
{cps=50}Northampton has already entrusted me with arming the millitiamen for the siege of Windsor, so all weapons are already in great demand.
{cps=50}You've guessed wrong.
{cps=50}I am aware that there is a shortage of equipment in the south of the kingdom due to the war, but Greenwich is not some dump. We have our own blacksmiths who can outfit and arm a small force.
{cps=50}It won't be easy, but we'll manage.
{cps=50}All I need from you is to provide me with a couple or three experienced soldiers from among your men who could teach the local bumpkins at least the elementary basics of the art of warfare.
{cps=50}It is not that I care that much about their fate, but since I am already investing money in them and our own lives are at stake in the current war, it is better to teach those fools at least something before throwing them into battle.
{cps=50}Understood. I'll find suitable candidates and send them over to you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [greenwich_militia.name!ti].
{cps=50}Perfect!
{cps=50}Now that there are enough instructors in Greenwich, we can move forward on this matter!{vspace=5}I'll let you know as soon as the first squad is ready to go.
{cps=50}How's the militia assembling going?
{cps=50}You're just in time! [ally!ti] group is ready to join your forces!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}25 militiamen hired!

{cps=50}And if those rumors are true, we now have one ally less.
{cps=50}The man, who received promises of friendship and mutual aid from me and, more importantly, Prince Edward, lost his head to your sword, [name].
{cps=50}That's not how things are done.
{cps=50}I hope you had a very good reason for acting that way and you're about to tell me about it.
{cps=50}However, if my memory serves me right, I gave you explicit orders not to spread your forces thin and concentrate on the fight against Canterbury.
{cps=50}According to the scouts, Canterbury's troops that have withdrawn to Oxford numbered about [kingdom_of_london_canterburys_army] men and are expected to be reinforced with about a thousand or two more reservists in the near future. So a campaign against Canterbury would be meaningless unless you can field at least [kingdom_of_london_can_continue_campaign] soldiers.
{cps=50}There he is!{w} Our little Judas.{w}{vspace=5}The jester king of the buffoonish kingdom.
{cps=50}So not only is he alive — although I saw his dead body with my own eyes — but he's also managed to take over Chippenham and become the marquis there?!
{cps=50}I never thought I'd say this, given everything that's happened, but...
{cps=50}But it is good to see you.
{cps=50}I don't blame you for what happened.
{cps=50}You did what you had to.
{cps=50}I know this because I would have done the same myself. Would have chosen duty over feelings...
{cps=50}I had no other choice.
{cps=50}And I'm glad you realize that.
{cps=50}I do.{w}{vspace=5}But there is something you should realize as well...
{cps=50}That every action has consequences.
{cps=50}And you will pay for what you did to my father.
{cps=50}I wish I could say that I would revel in your suffering. That in your blood I would find solace for my tears.
{cps=50}But unfortunately, that's not the case.
{cps=50}I despise and detest myself for once extending a helping hand to you and letting you on my doorstep.
{cps=50}And now I'll also despise myself for how I treated you.
{cps=50}But that's a burden I'm going to have to learn to live with.
{cps=50}Father always told me I had to be strong. I won't let him down.
{cps=50}Farewell, [name].
{cps=50}Well? We've got lots of exciting things ahead of us, so let's get started...
{cps=50}Listen, we can work out a deal...
{cps=50}Whatever they pay you here, I'll find a way to pay twice as much.
{cps=50}Twice as much, you say?
{cps=50}Sounds interesting.
{cps=50}There is just one small problem.
{cps=50}I'll torture you not because I'm getting paid for it.{w}{vspace=5}I'll do it because I am going to enjoy this.
{cps=50}So make yourself comfortable and relax.{w}{vspace=5}Think of something sweet.
{cps=50}Yet luckily for you, at night the cell door suddenly flies open and a shifty-looking man appears on the doorstep, constantly glancing around.
{cps=50}Yet luckily for you, at night several other English soldiers, who have been captured and held prisoner by the French in the same place as you, organize an escape.
{cps=50}No miracle takes place - after the night that you, with your teeth chattering from the chill, spent lying on the ice-cold floor of the narrow cell, comes the morning along with the continuation of yesterday's torture.
{cps=50}Well hello there, [name].
{cps=50}I see no point in introducing myself, since you already know me.
{cps=50}Looks like you're doing quite well for yourself here at the expense of the French crown.
{cps=50}A free roof over your head, security... The meals here, I suppose, are not that great, but, as they say, beggars can't be choosers.
{cps=50}I am no beggar.
{cps=50}Beggar or no beggar - that I cannot know. What is certain, however, is that you are a lousy assassin.
{cps=50}Humanly speaking, I even feel sorry for Northampton. You get a rare opportunity to finally dispose of your old enemy, devise a scheme, then send a trusted man to do the job... And that trusted man drops the sword at the last moment, ruining all your plans.
{cps=50}The old fox must have been furious.
{cps=50}You sound as if you're not happy about staying alive.
{cps=50}One cannot escape death. It cannot be cheated, nor can it be postponed.
{cps=50}Those destined to drown will not perish by an assassin's dagger. And those destined to fall on the battlefield will not die from poisoned wine.
{cps=50}Each of us will meet his own end, and that end is known.
{cps=50}All that, however, does not change the fact that you really are a shitty executor of orders. And if your unsuccessful attempt on my life was the only episode of your biography known to me, your fate would be of little interest to me.
{cps=50}And yet?
{cps=50}And yet, firstly, I am aware of the circumstances under which you were taken prisoner, as well as the bravery with which you fought.
{cps=50}I respect courageous people.{w}{vspace=5}Courage is the only character trait that cannot be faked.
{cps=50}You're either willing to risk your life or you're not.
{cps=50}Typically, people prefer either cloak and dagger or plate armor and sword. Few people are ready to try on both.
{cps=50}Fewer still can do it effectively.
{cps=50}All this, therefore, turns you from a common loser hitman into a rather valuable person.
{cps=50}And that's where the second factor comes into play.{w}{vspace=5}Your relationship with my daughter.
{cps=50}Before we proceed with this conversation, I would like to hear the answer to a simple question.
{cps=50}How serious are your intentions regarding Eva?
{cps=50}Fairly serious, sire.
{cps=50}I realize that I am not your daughter's match in status, but I am prepared to work tirelessly until I have your blessing for this marriage.
{cps=50}Those are quite large ambitions for a lowly peasant.
{cps=50}In any other situation, I would order you to be tortured half to death, then have your head chopped off and thrown into the nearest ditch.
{cps=50}However, in light of all the recent developments, I'm going to do things differently this time.
{cps=50}Eva's character and nature are well known to me, for it was I who gave her an upbringing and instilled in her the exact set of traits and qualities that I believed were right and decent.
{cps=50}And the fact that she chose you tells me more than years of irreproachable service would say.
{cps=50}And your refusal to take my life along with your valor on the battlefield only confirms it.
{cps=50}I'm surrounded by many decent people. People I can rely on.
{cps=50}But the reality is that behind each of them stands a certain house, clan, or family. And their unconditional loyalty can be counted on only as long as their personal interests are not affected.
{cps=50}And that's a major caveat for my current affairs. Very major.
{cps=50}You're a blank slate. An outsider in these lands. You're loyal only to Eva.{w}{vspace=5}Which means you're loyal only to me.
{cps=50}I need a man like you.
{cps=50}I'm offering you a position as my bodyguard.
{cps=50}I have already sworn fealty to the King of England and Earl Northampton.
{cps=50}The King of England is dead.
{cps=50}As for Northampton, his envoys have already arrived here to discuss the return of several captured noble knights and warriors.
{cps=50}And you weren't present in their list.
{cps=50}I've known him for a long while, and I understand his way of thinking. You're a valuable man to him, just not the most valuable. Maybe you will become such in the future, but right now you are who you are.
{cps=50}Meaning - nobody.
{cps=50}And I am offering you a chance to become somebody.
{cps=50}It doesn't look like I have a lot of options.{w}{vspace=5}I accept.
{cps=50}The right choice.{w}{vspace=5}Let's go. I'll order the guards to return your belongings.
{cps=50}Welcome to the French king's service.
{cps=50}I cannot renounce my suzerain, even if he has forgotten me.{w}{vspace=5}My loyalty is not for sale.
{cps=50}Worthy words.{w}{vspace=5}I accept your answer.
{cps=50}In that case, it's time to say farewell. I won't go into describing the opportunity you've missed, but I will tell you this...
{cps=50}If destiny brings us together again one day, I will be greatly impressed.
{cps=50}[name]! [name], wake up!
{cps=50}Eva...
{cps=50}Finally! Listen to me carefully and don't interrupt.
{cps=50}Fortunately for both of us, my father has not ordered your execution. But that doesn't mean that the danger has passed.
{cps=50}You can't stay here.
{cps=50}My men will help you to get out of here and return to the English camp.
{cps=50}And after that you will leave Cambrai.
{cps=50}I am not going to leave! I wish to stay with you.
{cps=50}Don't be silly. Now that the English forces are defeated, these lands will return to the control of the French king, and thus also of my father.
{cps=50}And I believe you know his stance on our relationship.
{cps=50}We don't have to stay here. We can travel wherever we want!
{cps=50}[name], please.
{cps=50}If you truly love me, you won't force me to choose between you and my family.
{cps=50}Everything I've told you is true. And I sincerely desire to spend the rest of my life with you.
{cps=50}Just not as a fugitive that abandoned her own home. But as a noble and virtuous Christian, carrying on her lineage and the traditions of her family.
{cps=50}Achieve my father's favor. I know you are capable of this.
{cps=50}He values courage and honor, and you have got those in spades.
{cps=50}I'll wait for you. For as long as it takes.
{cps=50}Agreed. I also think that I shouldn't linger here.
{cps=50}I'm sorry it has to end this way.
{cps=50}I am as well. However, the Lord has His plan for each one of us.
{cps=50}Perhaps things could have gone differently, but... But there's no need to grieve for what didn't happen.
{cps=50}We should be grateful for what we had.
{cps=50}I will remember you.
{cps=50}Now go.
{cps=50}I have no serious intentions regarding your daughter, sire.
{cps=50}Well then, at least that's an honest answer.
{cps=50}In that case, I've heard everything I wanted.
{size=-6}Нire
Fairly serious
Not so serious
I wish to stay with you
Agreed. I shouldn't linger here
{cps=50}Thanks to your efforts, the battle with the marauders not only ends in a resounding victory, but also results in no casualties.
{cps=50}Despite all your efforts, taking out the marauders without casualties proves impossible.
{cps=50}A messenger finds and informs you that de Roche summons you...
{cps=50}We are beset on all sides by foes, Guillaume. By God's providence, we managed to stop the English, but that's only half the trouble.
{cps=50}Normandy is in revolt, de Montfort in Brittany beheads royal envoys, the Castilians plunder the southern lands, the peasants flee to the forests to escape the taxes, and the merchants back in the capital arm their own warbands in the absence of the king.
{cps=50}The throne shakes under Jean.
{cps=50}You know that there is no man in France who has done more for the crown in general, as well as for Jean personally, than I have.
{cps=50}But even I can see that most of the problems that have befallen the king are of his own making.
{cps=50}I scorn snobby aristocrats no less than he does - but one can't treat noble people as if they were rootless peasants.
{cps=50}Especially those who shed their blood for him.
{cps=50}De Montfort has been in Scotland with me and risked his life fighting against the king's enemies... And for what?
{cps=50}For Jean's recent threats of potential confiscation of his title and lands for marrying a commoner instead of the royal third cousin?
{cps=50}To be fair, the refusal to marry the king's third cousin for the sake of some village girl - no matter how gorgeous she might be - was not the smartest move.
{cps=50}That might be so. But ruining relations with people who protect your life and crown with their swords isn't much smarter either.
{cps=50}Careful with that kind of talk, Guillaume...{w}{vspace=5}Especially with prying ears around.
{cps=50}You asked to see me, sire.
{cps=50}It will take some more time for my wounds to fully heal, but I am ready for duty.
{cps=50}Is this the mysterious assassin whose unsteady hand you owe your life to?
{cps=50}That would be him.
{cps=50}The lad's clearly got talent. And now that talent will be put to good use for us.
{cps=50}He might have talent, yet you still seem alive...
{cps=50}Which means he's not much of a killer.
{cps=50}A true professional's hand would never waver - no matter the target.
{cps=50}My assassins know that well.
{cps=50}I know your assassins well too, Raglan. By the time you finish negotiating the price with them, the victim would manage to grow old twice and then die of natural causes.
{cps=50}A good job costs good money, Guillaume, I don't have to tell you that.
{cps=50}You clearly don't, indeed.
{cps=50}Well, [name], let me introduce you to this unprincipled gentleman. His name is Raglan.
{cps=50}He, shall we say, assists King Jean in various confidential matters.
{cps=50}Raglan of Toulouse.{w}{vspace=5}At your service.
{cps=50}May I continue? This conversation is not meant for outsiders' ears.
{cps=50}You may. I trust him.
{cps=50}Well, you know best. After all, it is you who are responsible for your men.
{cps=50}And I will take full responsibility if the need arises.{vspace=5}Let's get down to business.
{cps=50}Plans change.{w} The king told me to pass on that he received a letter from Charles of Navarre - who wrote that the rebellion had been rapidly gaining ground and it is necessary to hurry...
{cps=50}Charles wrote...{w} That there might be more than just local nobility behind Geoffroy.
{cps=50}The roots of the rebellion may go much deeper underground.
{cps=50}Charles thinks...{w} That the Dauphin might be involved.
{cps=50}The Dauphin?
{cps=50}I don't believe this.{vspace=5}{w}The Dauphin is a frondeur, not a traitor.
{cps=50}I do not require you to believe in anything. I only tell you what the King has ordered me to relay to you.
{cps=50}The entire northwest of the duchy is already under the rebels' control, but the Dauphin is in no hurry to do anything about it and prefers to sit it out in Rouen.
{cps=50}If Charles is right after all, and he decides to support the revolt raised by Geoffroy d'Harcourt, then...
{cps=50}Then instead of one rebellious vassal, we shall get a whole breakaway duchy.
{cps=50}Precisely.
{cps=50}Obviously, I'm no expert, but I've visited the d'Harcourt family estate once. And I've got a feeling that storming the huge Rouen would be just a little harder than the tiny castle of Geoffroy.
{cps=50}However, that's not my headache.{vspace=5}{w}I certainly won't be the one to scale any walls.
{cps=50}It is not like we'd be able to find a ladder that could support your weight anyway.{w}{vspace=5}Although we could always launch you into the city from a trebuchet.
{cps=50}What has the king decided?
{cps=50}The king has ordered me to tell you to march at once.
{cps=50}He wants you and your men to arrive in Rouen as quickly as possible and take the Dauphin along with other potential conspirators into custody - until all the circumstances are clarified.
{cps=50}As well as prepare the city for defense and make sure that Geoffroy's uprising does not set all of Normandy aflame.
{cps=50}The king with the main troops will follow you at full speed.
{cps=50}And obviously, nobody must learn of the content of this conversation.
{cps=50}A rebellious vassal is one thing...
{cps=50}And a split within the royal house is a whole another.
{cps=50}I need no explanation for such things.
{cps=50}God have mercy, Guillaume.{vspace=5}It's rather meant for our new friend.
{cps=50}Charles will be awaiting you at Rouen.{w}{vspace=5}I hope to see you there alive and well, too.
{cps=50}The Dauphin... If there's anyone whose treachery I absolutely don't believe in, it's him.
{cps=50}What do you think about all this, [name]?
{cps=50}I have no clue as to what has just been discussed, sire.
{cps=50}I have never been to Rouen or the d'Harcourt family estate, and I don't know any of the mentioned people either.
{cps=50}I likely won't even be able to point out Normandy on a map.
{cps=50}Three hundred years ago, by the way, William of Normandy defeated the English king at Hastings and conquered your island.
{cps=50}So you, as an Englishman, certainly ought to know where Normandy is.
{cps=50}Well, that's fine. Soon you'll have the opportunity to fill the gaps in your education.
{cps=50}Pack your stuff.{vspace=5}We're going to Normandy.
{cps=50}Oh Lord! [name]! I am so happy to see you!
{cps=50}I suspected that after you refused to fulfill your mission and made the decision to spare my father's life, your command would throw you into the thick of the battle.
{cps=50}But thankfully all that is now left behind.
{cps=50}Your father has visited me...
{cps=50}I'm aware of that.{w} Just as I'm aware that you've managed to reach a certain understanding.
{cps=50}So now you're officially on the side of the French king.
{cps=50}Which opens up far greater prospects for our relationship...
{cps=50}I did it for your sake.
{cps=50}I realize it will be tough for a man of my background and status to get your father's approval, but I'm willing to do my utmost to make it happen.
{cps=50}I am flattered. However...
{cps=50}However, I expected no less from you.
{cps=50}As for background and status - yes, those things do matter, but to me they are completely secondary.
{cps=50}Especially now that I've seen who you really are.
{cps=50}Titles, status and a rich lineage will never replace sincerity, selflessness, strong character and a fervent heart.
{cps=50}And no one will ever replace you to me.
{cps=50}[name]! It is so good to see you!
{cps=50}I have spoken to your father. It looks like we're going to Normandy.
{cps=50}So we're going to be separated after all...
{cps=50}Well, it's not the most pleasant news, but also not the most surprising. Royal service is royal service.
{cps=50}We both know the path you'll have to take so that we can be together.
{cps=50}And I'm sure that you'll pass it with honor.
{cps=50}I'll be looking forward to meet you again.
{cps=50}Of course you will.
{cps=50}Speaking of meeting - it can happen a lot sooner than you think.
{cps=50}Now that the war is over, I'm no longer trapped here.
{cps=50}My father has got a residence in Paris, so I plan to get our Flemish estates in shape and head there.
{cps=50}I think it will be easier for us to meet in the capital.
{cps=50}And also...{vspace=5}{w} I'm certainly not implying anything...{vspace=5}{w} But I've heard that one can throw a very lovely wedding in Paris.
{cps=50}All right, all right. I'm kidding! Obviously we're going to have to wait for a while before we can get married.{vspace=5}{w} But you should always start preparing for such things early, right?
{cps=50}Promise me you'll be careful, [name].{vspace=5}{w}Take care of yourself and my father.
{cps=50}And may the Lord watch over you both.
{cps=50}Is there anything I can help you with?
{cps=50}According to what my father said, the war is over and the English are about to leave our lands...
{cps=50}I guess that's why those of them who didn't get enough loot in Cambrai continue to plunder and ravage my lands.
{cps=50}I've instructed a small squad of my men to scare them off, but to tell you the truth, I'm not sure who's going to scare who...
{cps=50}I've got decent men serving me, but most of their combat experience is limited to training bouts with a straw scarecrow.
{cps=50}And scarecrows are known to not retaliate.
{cps=50}That's what I'm talking about.
{cps=50}It would be great if you could give them at least a couple of lessons.{vspace=5}{w}And afterwards go with them and make sure everything goes smoothly.
{cps=50}By some miracle my homestead was not affected during the war, and to lose good people like that - when it all is almost over - would have been plain awful.
{cps=50}On the other hand, entrusting you with yet another potentially dangerous task after everything you've been through in the last few days...
{cps=50}I can handle it. You certainly don't have to worry about me.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [new_protector_of_de_lambert_estate.name!ti].
Your father said that we're going to Normandy
Is there anything I can help you with?
{color=#A9A9A9}Train Eva's people
{cps=50}You decide to spare the knight and are just about to announce him your prisoner.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Concussed!{vspace=5}Vitality decreased by 1!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Vitality decreased by 3!
{cps=50}{cps=50}And yet, firstly, I am aware of the circumstances under which you were taken prisoner.
{cps=50}The knight you fought in the forest is called Tristan of Clermont. I have seen him in battle many times and know him to be a great warrior.
{cps=50}And you not only defeated him, but also spared him, thusly demonstrating your worthy character twice.
{cps=50}Tristan, by the way, has returned the favor. His men wanted to kill you on the spot, but he ordered to keep you alive.
{cps=50}Chivalry begets chivalry.{w}{vspace=5}If you ever meet him again - don't forget to say thanks.
{cps=50}But back to you.
{cps=50}Covertly infiltrating the enemy's lair, fighting bravely on the battlefield, challenging a formidable knight - even though a wounded one - these are all signs of remarkable courage.
{cps=50}At de Roche's request, you are given a rank and a salary.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You have received the rank of Esquire.
{cps=50}As soon as you report that the route to Rouen has been cleared, de Roche immediately gives the order to move out and, after just a couple of hours, you break into the duke's residence.
{cps=50}Having dealt with the bandits, you proceed to Rouen and after just an hour break into the duke's residence.
{cps=50}After defeating the brigand squad, you return to Oissel.
{cps=50}You see that the battle does not develop in your favor and choose to retreat with nothing, seeking only to preserve your life.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 5!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 5!
{cps=50}Guillaume? I'm always delighted to have you in my house, but why the hell do you burst in here like a comet?
{cps=50}And it doesn't look like you came to me with the best of intentions.
{cps=50}Explain yourself at once or I'll have my knights throw you out.
{cps=50}It was not a whim of mine that brought me here, Dauphin, but your father's will.
{cps=50}You and your knights will lay down your arms and await his arrival in Rouen, under the protection of my men.
{cps=50}You hear that, Charles?! My bloody pops has apparently gone completely off his rocker.
{cps=50}I hear.
{cps=50}And what, may I ask, am I accused of, Guillaume?
{cps=50}The King will charge you himself if he deems it necessary.
{cps=50}To hell with it, Guillaume! To hell with you and to hell with my father.
{cps=50}He can have Normandy back - I wouldn't want it even for free. And he may deal with all his problems on his own.
{cps=50}I'm off to Senlis.{w}{vspace=5}Charles, I hope you won't mind keeping me company.
{cps=50}I'm asking you as a friend. Let's avoid the violence.
{cps=50}That's enough! No more!
{cps=50}I will submit to the will of the king.{w}{vspace=5}Whatever... {w} Whatever it might be.
{cps=50}Thank you for your prudence, Dauphin.{w}{vspace=5}I'm sorry it ended this way... {w}My friend.
{cps=50}Nice work, de Roche. You are just in time.
{cps=50}Not to be rude, Your Grace, but...
{cps=50}But I truly hope you have very solid evidence suggesting that the Dauphin is indeed involved in the uprising.
{cps=50}Such words could easily be interpreted as questioning my integrity.{w}{vspace=5}But given the moment, I'll turn a blind eye.
{cps=50}I have proof of the Dauphin's complicity in Geoffroy d'Harcourt's plot, and my men will provide it to the king personally as soon as he arrives here.
{cps=50}This matter concerns his son directly and requires delicacy, so if you really have any doubt that Charles of Navarre is telling the truth, you'll have to take my word for it for now.
{cps=50}I wouldn't dare to doubt your sincerity, Your Grace.{w}{vspace=5}But when such vociferous accusations are made, one always wants to see proof.
{cps=50}All in good time. Especially since we have got larger problems on our hands.{w}{vspace=5} How was your trip?
{cps=50}No trouble. Rouen's outskirts are crawling with bandits, but we made it without difficulty.
{cps=50}I feared that the rebels would have time to get closer to the city, but it seems like we're in luck.
{cps=50}That's true. Despite the Dauphin's passivity, Geoffroy is also in no hurry, preferring to rally his supporters to the d'Harcourt family castle and bide his time.
{cps=50}He is in no rush to invade deep into the duchy, but this slowness is deceptive.
{cps=50}He knows these parts like the back of his hand, and he has also got lots of friends around here, who are ready to supply his troops.
{cps=50}The English might also provide him with assistance.
{cps=50}So when he does decide to strike, it could be lightning fast and deadly.
{cps=50}His only chance of serious success lies in capturing Rouen. As long as the city is in our hands, the defeat of Geoffroy's rebellion is only a matter of time.
{cps=50}Despite the Dauphin's intention to sabotage the defenses of Rouen, I sent a paper on his behalf to the local bailiff with orders to gather troops and advance toward the city.
{cps=50}With him and his men, you should have enough forces to hold Rouen and contain Geoffroy until the royal army arrives.
{cps=50}How you're going to do it, however, is not my concern.
{cps=50}I'm not going to teach you how to wage war. It's your job to defeat the king's enemies on the battlefield.
{cps=50}My job is to rule Navarre and not let any of my allies get stabbed in the back.{w}{vspace=5}And I've done my part.
{cps=50}It's your turn now.
{cps=50}Geoffroy doesn't stand a chance, Your Grace.{w}{vspace=5}But just in case, I think you should leave Rouen.
{cps=50}If it comes to a siege, this will be no place for a monarch.
{cps=50}Now that's something I completely agree with.
{cps=50}See you in Paris.
{cps=50}Presenting you with the opportunity to make up for your failure to clear the road ambushes, de Roche assigns you the task of assisting the bailiff's men.
{cps=50}Impressed by your organizational skills, de Roche assigns you the task of assisting the bailiff's men.
{cps=50}I need this one alive, [name]!
{cps=50}There's no use for corpses, and we need to find out who sent them!
{cps=50}Well... If I knew it would end like this - I'd order you cut his hands off.
{cps=50}Although in that case that bastard would probably just jump out the window.
{cps=50}He said about free Normandy, sire.{vspace=5}Perhaps the attack was a rebel plot.
{cps=50}Maybe it is indeed a greeting from Geoffroy d'Harcourt. Or maybe it isn't.
{cps=50}There are many individuals who would like to get even with me. You of all people should know that.
{cps=50}In any case...
{cps=50}It appears that once again I must thank you for saving my life.
{cps=50}If not for you, those fellows would have shredded me like a cabbage.
{cps=50}That's what I have no doubt about.{vspace=5}{w}It's all the rest that raises questions...
{cps=50}And here I just got excited about no longer having to sleep in chainmail.
{cps=50}All right. You may go now. The sooner we put an end to Geoffroy's rebellion, the less likely he'll be to organize something like this again.
{cps=50}You heard it all yourself, [name].
{cps=50}I'm already short on manpower, so the last thing I need right now is to get ambushed in the woods and lose some troops before I even reach Rouen.
{cps=50}Horses and humans require rest. Especially in the face of the uncertainty that lies ahead.
{cps=50}So here's an opportunity for you to prove yourself.
{cps=50}Take a look around Oissel and the surroundings, gather a squad of local folks for yourself. The people here are not particularly rich, so they'll easily follow you to the middle of nowhere just for a gold florin.
{cps=50}Once you've recruited enough men, scour the route and make sure the road is safe.
{cps=50}Just don't rush into any serious trouble yourself as you usually do. Let the yokels pull the chestnuts out of the fire.
{cps=50}And also, don't drag this out. If you don't get it all done in a day or two, we'll have to proceed blindly.{w}{vspace=5}And my first impression of you will be spoiled.
{cps=50}Come on in, [name].{vspace=5}Let's hear what you've got there.
{cps=50}This Charles whom Raglan mentioned in a conversation with you and who is now holed up in Rouen, is he one of the king's informants?
{cps=50}Thank God you had the sense to ask me that question before we got to Rouen.
{cps=50}Did I say something wrong?
{cps=50}Your guess was a little off, put it that way.
{cps=50}The Charles mentioned by Raglan is Charles the Second of Navarre - a distant relative of the king, one of the largest landowners in France and, concurrently, the King of Navarre.
{cps=50}Huh. That's a bit of a surprise.
{cps=50}Jean has an uneasy relationship with him, just as with everyone in general, and they have clashed in the past not once.
{cps=50}But with the start of the English invasion they managed to reach reconciliation and now, while Jean leads the troops, Charles 'looks after' the most troublesome places of the kingdom.
{cps=50}We all suspected the possibility of a rebellion in Normandy, but the Dauphin's participation in it was hardly predictable for anyone...
{cps=50}It certainly wasn't for me.
{cps=50}The healer thanks you for the assistance and promises to make the first batch of new potions and concoctions tomorrow - and, of course, hold on to them until your visit.
{cps=50}Also, as a token of his great appreciation, he gifts you a small chest of his own handiwork.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Chest obtained!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Item handed over — [antidote2.name!ti].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}You do not have the required item in the inventory!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The bailiff thanks you for the help and informs you that this should suffice to restore his men's combat capability.

{cps=50}However, after seeing how well the city is protected and how numerous its garrison is - reinforced by de Roche's men, the bailiff's detachment, as well as the peasant militia that you have gathered, Geoffroy abruptly loses confidence in his forces and, after standing for a couple of days under the walls of Rouen, opts to fall back to the castle of Saint-Sauveur.
{cps=50}You manage to capture Geoffroy alive. Seeing this, his men also cease their resistance.
{cps=50}Desperately resisting, Geoffroy d'Harcourt gets killed in battle, and so you fail to take him alive.
{cps=50}Finally. I was starting to grow moss in here.
{cps=50}I think some face fungus would suit you just fine.
{cps=50}I've been to a lot of secret meetings, but I never tire of finding irony in how often the fate of the kingdom can be decided in seemingly completely random places.
{cps=50}The fate of the kingdom is determined by the king.{vspace=5}{w}And we are but his humble servants, who help the monarch's will come to fruition.
{cps=50}Nice words.{vspace=5}I'm glad you still think that way.
{cps=50}Because I started having some negative thoughts since our last meeting...
{cps=50}That some negative thoughts could cross your mind.
{cps=50}The Dauphin did not deserve such a punishment. The evidence Charles presented is circumstantial at best.
{cps=50}Well, circumstantial or not, the Dauphin did not shy away from befriending the rebel Geoffroy. And we all know how Geoffroy, even before the uprising, allowed himself to speak of the king.
{cps=50}Furthermore, the Dauphin was, to put it mildly, in no hurry to gather troops against the rebels.
{cps=50}The Dauphin's slowness in assembling troops? The lad's still just a young pup. He can barely buckle a saddle on a horse, let alone run a duchy.
{cps=50}Hm. Let's suppose that is so.
{cps=50}The Dauphin's friendship with Geoffroy can be easily explained at least by the fact that Geoffroy is his damn vassal.
{cps=50}And as for the criticism of the king - in all honesty, it was Jean who was the first to publicly insult him.
{cps=50}Just like de Montfort. Just like the Dauphin. Just like the English negotiators two years ago and many, many, many others.
{cps=50}If the master kicks everyone left and right, it should come as no surprise that yard dogs scatter from him.
{cps=50}Questioning the king's etiquette, comparing the crown prince to a backyard dog - and all in one sentence. That's quite bold even by your standards, Guillaume.
{cps=50}You're lucky we're having this conversation away from prying ears.{vspace=5}{w}Otherwise, someone could earn themselves a cozy cell in the dungeons with such talk. Or even a visit to the executioner.
{cps=50}Pf-f-ft. What, you're thinking of ratting me out? I don't believe that.
{cps=50}You're my friend, Guillaume, but the crown is the crown and it must be respected.
{cps=50}Because if we lose respect for it... What will we have left?
{cps=50}Tell me honestly - do you think Charles is lying?
{cps=50}All of Navarre, as they say, is about the size of the local innkeeper's wife's ass.... But it's still a kingdom. And Charles is its king.
{cps=50}And accusing a king of lying is a quite serious offense, just as you said it yourself.
{cps=50}You shouldn't be offended. Despite our 'differences' on some issues - we're on the same side.{vspace=5}{w}At least as long as you don't start a mutiny like our friend Geoffroy.
{cps=50}Which I hope will not be the case.
{cps=50}As for Charles, he's obviously a king, but he's not our king. And that makes a huge difference.
{cps=50}I don't know, Raglan. I'm a warrior, not some palace schemer.
{cps=50}I know how to keep people in line, how to reach compromises and find common ground with lords when royal service demands it.{vspace=5}{w}But intrigues are not my thing.
{cps=50}All I know is that Charles, with his bottomless pockets and an endless list of debtors, vassals and landed estates scattered throughout the kingdom, is the second most powerful man in France after the king.
{cps=50}He had a grudge against Jean, and the war with the English was the perfect time for him to stab the king in the back.
{cps=50}But he didn't. Unlike Geoffroy.
{cps=50}Of course, he didn't help out with any troops either - just like de Montfort... But Charles at least has the excuse of the war with the Castilians.
{cps=50}So...
{cps=50}I see it pretty much the same way.{w} We need to keep an eye on Charles, but right now he's the least of our problems.
{cps=50}I'm glad we had this talk.

{cps=50}Thanks to his extensive agent network both within the city and in its outskirts, Geoffroy receives comprehensive information about the state of the defenses - including the extremely limited forces at de Roche's disposal.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Squad size and strength, completion of quests check failed!
{cps=50}However, after seeing how well the city is protected and how numerous its garrison is - reinforced by de Roche's men, the bailiff's detachment, as well as the peasant militia that you have gathered, Geoffroy abruptly loses confidence in his forces and, after standing for a couple of days under the walls of Rouen, opts to fall back to the castle of Saint-Sauveur.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Squad size and strength, completion of quests check passed!

{cps=50}About that royal feast you mentioned earlier, sire...
{cps=50}You are just in time. We should get going.
{cps=50}Didn't I tell you to put on some decent clothes? I wouldn't be surprised if you got refused entry - with such appearance.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Prestige check failed!
{cps=50}All right, let's go. I'll put in a word for you if need be.
{cps=50}In light of recent betrayals and indignities, I'm glad to finally be surrounded by real men.
{cps=50}Men...
{cps=50}And not vile dogs like Geoffroy d'Harcourt...
{cps=50}...Simon de Montfort...
{cps=50}...and my eldest son!{vspace=5}{w}May they all burn in hellfire til kingdom come!
{cps=50}You told me, Charles... You warned me of Geoffroy's rotten nature, but I didn't listen even though I should have.
{cps=50}I raise this cup to you, Charles! To my faithful friend who has watched over the welfare of the royal lands in my absence.
{cps=50}But it is not just Charles of Navarre who is worthy of praise...{vspace=5}{w}I want to raise the second cup to the man who has done more for me than anyone else.
{cps=50}To the man who has spilled so much blood of my enemies that the entire Seine could be colored crimson.
{cps=50}To the man whose loyalty I would not doubt, even if the angels themselves descended from heaven and tried to convince me otherwise.
{cps=50}To you, Guillaume!
{cps=50}If my spies' reports are anything to go by, toasts to your health are regularly raised in taverns all over the kingdom, and the peasants refer to you as none other than 'The Keeper of France'.{vspace=5}{w}And that's saying something.
{cps=50}Thank you, Your Grace.
{cps=50}Thank you for your kind words, my friend. The victory over the English and the Norman rebels is certainly worth celebrating.
{cps=50}But we must be careful - new enemies have taken the place of the vanquished ones. Routiers and brigands ravage the northern lands, while the southern regions - including my native Navarre - suffer from the raids of Pedro the Cruel's Castilian cutthroats.
{cps=50}You know it yourself...
{cps=50}...that I do not have enough men to organize a march to Brittany and secure Paris at the same time.
{cps=50}Which means I've got to choose.{vspace=5}{w}And I choose Paris.
{cps=50}As my father used to say, if both the house and the barn are on fire at the same time, it's definitely not the shed that should be saved.
{cps=50}I understand your logic. But the kingdom is not a stockyard, and Brittany is not a barn with cows and goats.
{cps=50}I do not deny the significance of Paris, but Brittany is a coastal region and its ports are the gateway to the interior of France. You can't throw lands like those around.
{cps=50}Raglan will back me up on this: if a vassal of the French king is not seated in Rennes, then a vassal of the king of England will appear there very soon.
{cps=50}That is correct.
{cps=50}And what do you suggest I do? It is not like I've got more troops from this information alone.
{cps=50}There is nothing more than a gang of brigands in the vicinity of Paris. You can hold them off with a small force - they've got nothing against the castle walls.
{cps=50}As for Brittany, I could lend you a certain sum and help you to muster troops.
{cps=50}And why have you become so generous all of a sudden? You're not planning to get your hands on the duchy, are you, old man?
{cps=50}Looking to make some profit from the interests of the crown?
{cps=50}Well, I don't separate the crown's interests from my own.
{cps=50}Everyone present here is aware that I am one of the largest landowners in France.{vspace=5}What's good for France is good for me.
{cps=50}You hear that, Raglan?{vspace=5}Charles, you're quite a rascal!
{cps=50}I might be a rascal, however I'm on your side.
{cps=50}And you don't have many such people left.
{cps=50}You're right on that one.
{cps=50}Abandoning Brittany is not an option. You'd be signing your own death warrant.
{cps=50}Here's what I propose to do...
{cps=50}We'll determine the fate of the duchy once it's free of the routiers. But no matter who gets it, you guarantee assistance in defending Navarre against the Castilians.
{cps=50}And meanwhile I'll assemble a detachment to march on Rennes and cover its expenses.{vspace=5}As for the rest - you've already got a specialist in solving such matters.
{cps=50}Sire...{w} Sire...
{cps=50}I'm here to talk to you...
{cps=50}And just who are you?
{cps=50}My name is [name]. I am a knight in the service of Guillaume de Roche...
{cps=50}Huh. First he helps my father, a paranoiac and a tyrant, to put me behind bars, and now he, what, sends assassins after me?
{cps=50}Can't wait for the king to order my beheading, eh? Decided to speed things up a bit?
{cps=50}No, sire. That's not what I'm here for.
{cps=50}What for then?
{cps=50}De Roche doesn't believe you're guilty. He thinks that you wouldn't betray your father.
{cps=50}Is that so? It's always nice to hear that your friends have trust in you.
{cps=50}But in that case let me ask you — why the hell did he slaughter my men and put me in custody?
{cps=50}It seems as if the old warrior is trying to take some precautions in case of my escape from here...
{cps=50}Which I will make happen.{vspace=5}{w}And when that happens...
{cps=50}I will take revenge. Revenge on everyone - starting with my father and ending with my 'friend' Guillaume.
{cps=50}Sire, tell it to me straight, were you involved in Geoffroy d'Harcourt's conspiracy?
{cps=50}Pf-f-ft. What do you think, knight?
{cps=50}Sire, I...
{cps=50}Enough chitchat. Pass on my best wishes to your chief and my father.
{cps=50}Interested in the sum of money that Bertrand has mentioned, you promise to help him in organizing the escape.
{cps=50}Aiding a criminal is not part of your plans, so you refuse the convict's offer and hastily get out of the Conciergerie.
{cps=50}After successfully landing at the port and pushing the routiers back, you begin to advance deeper into the city.
{cps=50}The good spirit prevailing among the members of the detachment, however, quickly dissipates as soon as you see the outskirts of the capital in the distance, which are engulfed in flames and shrouded in smoke.
{cps=50}At dusk you reach the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, near which there is one of the bridges across the Seine leading to the capital. But you are not able to cross it just yet, for right next to the bridge you spot a well-equipped outpost defended by a large group of armed men.
{cps=50}At some point, a stately knight appears among the guards...
{cps=50}You wanted to see me, sire...{w}{vspace=5}...{w}{vspace=5}Are you all right
{cps=50}I've dedicated my entire life to the royal service, [name].
{cps=50}I was and still am faithful to the oath to the king that I once took...
{cps=50}Deep inside, however, I have always felt that my true loyalty, and may Raglan forgive me for saying so, belongs not so much to the crown itself, as... to the kingdom as a whole.
{cps=50}To France.
{cps=50}This is an idea that few people understand or share - and I certainly don't expect you to, but I have always seen France as something more than just a set of disparate lands united under the formal, and sometimes not the most sensible, authority of one man.
{cps=50}These are dangerous words, sire.
{cps=50}It is not your place to tell me that, [name].{w}{vspace=5}Nor is it my place to tell the king how to run his affairs, however.
{cps=50}But I cannot get rid of the thought that all the misfortunes and troubles that have fallen upon the kingdom are not so much the result of evil fate or foes' machinations, as...
{cps=50}As of the consequences of one man's mistakes.{w}{vspace=5}Mistakes that he does not wish to admit and from which he does not want to learn.
{cps=50}Anyway, that's enough of sorrowful reflections.
{cps=50}Put yourself in order, [name], and get prepared for another campaign.{vspace=5}Something tells me we won't be staying in Paris for long.
{cps=50}Ah, and one more thing - the king is throwing a feast to celebrate his triumphant return to the capital after the victories over the Norman rebels and the English.
{cps=50}It doesn't seem to me like the best time for a feast, but the king's wish is the king's wish.
{cps=50}I shall, of course, attend it, and you - since you're a knight now - may come with me. Just be sure to dress appropriately.
{cps=50}All right, [name], listen up.
{cps=50}I know you're probably more tired than anyone else, but I'm afraid we won't be getting much rest anytime soon.
{cps=50}There is clearly something fishy going on in Paris, and by the looks of it, the king could use our help again...
{cps=50}I have too few men, and Paris is not Rennes, so we must proceed with caution. I need eyes and ears in the city, so you will take on that role.
{cps=50}Get a couple hours of sleep so you can stay on your feet, then get to work.
{cps=50}Find a way around the outpost at the bridge, get into the city and see for yourself what's going on there. Assess how realistic it would be for us to get to the royal castle without encountering an angry mob on the way.
{cps=50}Understood, sire. It will be done.
{cps=50}I don't know how feasible it would be for you to meet Raglan or Charles of Navarre in person and inform them of our arrival - so I don't request that from you...
{cps=50}However, if you could make it to Cité, sneak into the royal castle and meet Raglan...{vspace=5}Or go through the entire city and reach Charles' Parisian residence behind the Vincennes Forest - that would be very helpful.
{cps=50}I don't believe in omens, signs and portents, [name]...{vspace=5}{w}But I can't escape the feeling that Jean's time is coming to an end...
{cps=50}And that the only power which time and time again helps him keep both his throne and his life is that of my own hands.
{cps=50}Maybe it's a test of faith and loyalty that God has sent me...{vspace=5}{w} Or maybe it's a sign that it's time to think for myself.
{cps=50}Dangerous thoughts, I know.{vspace=5}{w}It's a good thing I don't believe in signs, right?
{cps=50}All right, that would be enough for you. Go get some rest and get to work.
{cps=50}Be careful and remember that the fate of the entire kingdom now depends on you.
{cps=50}What will be our next assignment, sire? Where will we go?
{cps=50}I don't know yet.
{cps=50}According to the news that reaches me, Brittany seems to have the worst of it.
{cps=50}While we were preoccupied with Geoffroy's rebellion, Rennes - the main city of Brittany - was completely taken over by mercenaries, the duke and his spouse were killed, and the local wealthy landowners decided that they would now rule the duchy themselves.
{cps=50}Order must be restored there as soon as possible.
{cps=50}But I doubt that the king would find sufficient forces for such an operation. Especially since even the capital is not safe right now.
{cps=50}Most likely, we'll be tasked with clearing the outskirts of Paris of routiers. So get ready to roam the woods.
{cps=50}And who was the Duke of Brittany, sire? I think you've mentioned his name before...
{cps=50}I have.{w}{vspace=5}Simon de Montfort.
{cps=50}An old comrade of mine from the war in Scotland. It was during that campaign that we met.
{cps=50}My father and grandfather come from Flanders and the Low Countries, and de Montfort hails from Brittany, although his family has its roots in the Scandinavian lands far to the north.
{cps=50}As he told me himself, four centuries ago his ancestors sailed to Normandy and Brittany with Rollon as pirates in search of plunder.
{cps=50}But, in time, they settled down here, paid homage to the king - it was Charles the Simple, if my memory serves me right - and received those lands as a fief.
{cps=50}Where else could an heir of the Duke of Brittany and a descendant of Flemish knights become friends but in the mountains of Scotland? It was a glorious time.
{cps=50}We gave the English a good thrashing back then.
{cps=50}Well, I've already mentioned the tragic ending of this story to you.
{cps=50}Jean wanted to marry his cousin to him - from a political and career perspective it would have been a great match for de Montfort.
{cps=50}But that royal cousin weighed as much as both of us on our horses and in armor altogether. So the duke instead favored some pretty peasant girl. With no family name or dowry, but with a snatched waist.
{cps=50}The king was furious...{w}And you already know what happened next.{w}{vspace=5}Another staunch ally turned into an enemy.
{cps=50}So now he is dead, and his duchy is being plundered and torn apart by vulture-like brigands.
{cps=50}I thought Eva was coming to Paris too...
{cps=50}Until the routier problem is solved, the roads throughout the northern part of the kingdom are not safe.
{cps=50}Sire... I know it's none of my business, but I wanted to ask you a question.
{cps=50}About the Dauphin...
{cps=50}Then ask, if you wanted to.
{cps=50}You don't really consider him guilty, right? And yet you don't believe that Charles of Navarre slandered him either?
{cps=50}If Charles had wanted to turn against the king, he would have done so during the English invasion. Also, he would have assisted Geoffroy, or at the very least, wouldn't have gotten in his way.
{cps=50}And he did the exact opposite. I don't believe he's guilty.
{cps=50}As for the Dauphin... He's still just a young lad. I know that he has had plenty of Jean's 'fatherly love' and now has little sympathy for him.
{cps=50}But plotting against the king? I don't believe it.
{cps=50}All of this seems as if there's someone else involved.
{cps=50}We owe it to ourselves to get to the bottom of this, sire.
{cps=50}Pf-f-f! I personally don't owe anyone anything and I'm not going to pry into royal affairs without being asked.
{cps=50}I won't lie - as someone who knows the Dauphin personally, I'd be interested in hearing his side of the story...
{cps=50}But the Dauphin, by order of Jean, has been placed in the dungeons of the Conciergerie - the royal castle on the west of the Île de la Cité - and no one is allowed to visit him.
{cps=50}However, any Parisian knows that the Conciergerie is famous for two things: its consummate torturers...{w}{vspace=5}and its perpetually sleepy and slothful guards.
{cps=50}In that case, I suppose I could pay the Dauphin a visit.
{cps=50}As your immediate superior, I forbid you to do so.
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}But I'm a busy person, as you know, and I can't keep track of everything.{vspace=5}{w}So I'll rely on your discretion...
{cps=50}Palace intrigues are a highly dangerous business, sire. Even I realize that.
{cps=50}It is good that you do.
{cps=50}Let Raglan sort this out. He's the privy counsellor, so he should be the one to unravel these secrets.
{cps=50}We can't waste time in vain, [name].{vspace=5}We need to find out what's going on in Paris.
{cps=50}...then spits disdainfully on the floor and declares that not so long ago he served under the command of the current king's youngest brother's second uncle. Which is why he's not going to join the service of some random stranger.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige check failed!
{cps=50}...then nods approvingly and declares that he'd be willing to serve under you for the right money.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige check passed!
{cps=50}The prospect of getting a highly experienced veteran in your squad, who's probably worth ten militia recruits, appeals to you, and you offer Pascal your help with resolving his health issues.
{cps=50}Admitting the truth of his words, you bid him farewell.
{cps=50}After finding the hunter's house and getting to know its owner, you make him an offer to join your squad.

{cps=50}You don't have much confidence in outlaws' honor, so you opt for money.
{cps=50}Realizing that money tends to run out, while useful connections might last a lifetime, you pick the second option.
{cps=50}Before heading back, you decide to take a look around the forest camp, where, besides the routiers, there are also a lot of other various people, ranging from traders of all kinds (most likely fences) to vagabonds, beggars, and adventurers of all sorts.
{cps=50}By morning twilight you reach the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, near which there is one of the bridges across the Seine leading to the capital. But you are not able to cross it just yet, for right next to the bridge you spot a well-equipped outpost defended by a large group of armed men.

{cps=50}After dealing with the enemies, you continue on your way.
{cps=50}You return to the abbey...
{cps=50}Welcome, [name].
{cps=50}When the servant told me that a man from De Roche had arrived, I did not believe my ears at first.
{cps=50}Jean and I were sure you'd be stuck in Brittany for at least six months.
{cps=50}Well, I'm rarely happy about my miscalculations, but this must be the case.
{cps=50}Tell de Roche to rush with his men here. I'm now gathering forces to crush the rebellion, and his help would be most welcome.
{cps=50}All the entrances to the city are blocked off by outposts, sire.{vspace=5}{w}If the rumors are to be believed, it was done by your men.
{cps=50}That's right. I gave them orders not to let anyone into Paris.
{cps=50}We can't allow any aid to reach the rebels.
{cps=50}Here. Show this paper at any of the outposts and my men will let you through.
{cps=50}About the Dauphin, Sire. It is said that he has escaped...
{cps=50}That's correct. As far as I can tell, it was his escape that signaled the rebels to start the uprising.
{cps=50}It was a mistake to let the heir live. But that is certainly no fault of mine. I reported to Jean that the Dauphin was doing business with the Norman rebel Geoffroy d'Harcourt.
{cps=50}I also warned him that the Dauphin might have ties with Étienne Marcel, but alas...
{cps=50}I was repeatedly told that French affairs are better seen from Paris than from Navarre's Pamplona...
{cps=50}I wonder what they will tell me now.
{cps=50}I own dozens of lands and estates throughout the French kingdom, but if I ever lose the title of king of my beloved Navarre, I will gladly become not a duke, not a count, and not a marquis, but a mayor.
{cps=50}The mayor of a town by the name of 'Toldyouso'.
{cps=50}Understood, Your Grace.{vspace=5}May I go now?
{cps=50}Go, [name].{vspace=5}And tell de Roche that he arrived just in time, like always.
{cps=50}De Roche! Good to see you, old sport.{vspace=5}{w}Come on in and have a seat.
{cps=50}Greetings, Your Grace.{vspace=5}{w}Thank you for your kind welcome, but I'm afraid we don't have much time. We must act quickly.
{cps=50}The king is in trouble.
{cps=50}The king is in trouble indeed.{vspace=5}{w}Trouble, that he has brought upon himself.
{cps=50}I can imagine how you feel now, Guillaume.
{cps=50}The king spoils relations with the English - you are the one who has to drive them out of France.{vspace=5}{w}The king allows Normandy to rise in rebellion - you are the one who has to deal with Geoffroy.{vspace=5}{w}The king lets the routiers run rampant - you are the one who is sent to restore order.
{cps=50}The discontent of the common Jacques with taxes and levies has long been known. The mood among the merchants and peddlers has also been no secret to anyone.{w} Anyone other than Jean, apparently.
{cps=50}And now this. And once again it is you who has to clean up the king's mess.
{cps=50}Maybe enough is enough?{vspace=5}{w}Maybe the salvation of the kingdom lies not in the regular extinguishing of fires, but in the timely elimination of arsonists?
{cps=50}I'm not sure I understand you properly, Your Grace.
{cps=50}What you propose has a plain and simple name.{vspace=5}{w}Treason.
{cps=50}Oh come on, de Roche. We both know that although you're an old soldier, you're no fool. You can't help but realize what Jean and the House of Valois are turning the kingdom into.
{cps=50}The Capetians must regain the throne, and I, as a full representative of the House of Évreux, must become the heir of the old king.
{cps=50}We both know that Jean is unfit to wear the crown, and the only reason that he still somehow miraculously remains on the throne is because of people like you.
{cps=50}And now just imagine what the two of us could accomplish.{vspace=5}{w}What kind of kingdom we could build...
{cps=50}I have just one question.{vspace=5}{w}What became of the Dauphin?
{cps=50}The Dauphin is in my hands. He was successfully transferred from a cell in the Conciergerie to a cell in the dungeons of my castle and is now quietly awaiting his fate.{vspace=5}{w}But our conversation isn't about him.
{cps=50}Make no mistake, Guillaume. The fact that I am graciously offering you the opportunity to join me doesn't mean I can't do it without you.
{cps=50}Yes, my men failed to eliminate you in Rouen and Paris.
{cps=50}Yes, when I sent you to Rennes, I hoped you'd be stuck there for at least five months.
{cps=50}And, yes, I took your appearance here as a sign from above, signaling that I should team up with you instead of feuding.
{cps=50}I am willing to apologize for trying to claim your life, as well as swear that I will never attempt it again.
{cps=50}And also back up my words with gold.{vspace=5}{w}I've got plenty of it, as you know. And I'm always happy to share it with my friends.
{cps=50}We both hate Jean for his abruptness, lack of tact and inability to compromise.
{cps=50}But unlike him, we both know how to negotiate.
{cps=50}See!
{cps=50}You have to understand how generous is the offer I make you here.{vspace=5}{w}And I'm sure you'll appreciate it.
{cps=50}But, just in case, I'll still make one important caveat...
{cps=50}Don't think you have the power to affect anything.
{cps=50}The capital is cut off. If not today then tomorrow Étienne Marcel and his men will take the royal castle by storm...
{cps=50}And Jean will have to answer some very inconvenient questions from his grateful subjects.
{cps=50}And after the infuriated mob has slaughtered the reviled king, my men will crush the revolt and I will ride triumphantly into Paris on a white horse.
{cps=50}All the sedition, intrigue, and treachery will be pinned on Étienne Marcel and the Dauphin...
{cps=50}And the tragic death of the king will become a cautionary tale about what happens when a man unfit for the monarch's burden sits on the throne.
{cps=50}Choose.
{cps=50}I would love to say that Jean is the perfect king who embodies each and every quality that a true monarch is supposed to possess...
{cps=50}But obviously that would be a lie.
{cps=50}However, it is not my job to choose the king.{w} My job is to serve him.{vspace=5}{w}And die for him if I have to.
{cps=50}Wrong answer.
{cps=50}Nice work, [name].
{cps=50}Thanks to you, the fog of war is slowly lifting and we at least won't have to poke around blindly.
{cps=50}But I'm still in desperate need of manpower. I can hardly help Charles much with one tiny squad...
{cps=50}And he seems to have little confidence in his own abilities either. Otherwise he would have rushed to Jean's aid instead of staying holed up in his residence.
{cps=50}I can't help but see signs in all these things, [name].
{cps=50}Jean's power, crumbling like a sandcastle...
{cps=50}A firefighting team, composed of you and me, scurrying all over the kingdom in desperate attempts to stop the flames from devouring it...
{cps=50}The general revolt against the king, Charles' sluggishness, my departure for Brittany, the outpost on the bridge blocking our way...
{cps=50}I wasn't supposed to be here at all, [name].{w} At most, I should have been sleeping peacefully in Versailles by now.
{cps=50}It is not something to be talked about, but Jean is far from being the best king. The Dauphin, in spite of his youth and ambition, is far more intelligent, restrained and shrewd.
{cps=50}Or take Charles of Navarre, for that matter... After all, he, too, was a candidate for the French throne not so long ago.
{cps=50}Yes, he's a sly schemer, but something tells me he wouldn't turn every last peasant against himself.
{cps=50}And we certainly wouldn't have to put out fires all over the kingdom because of him.
{cps=50}Dangerous words, I know.
{cps=50}I've been at court for a long time, [name], so I'm good at keeping my mouth shut.{vspace=5}{w}But these thoughts...
{cps=50}There's no getting away from them.
{cps=50}And lately, there have been more and more of them.
{cps=50}All right.{vspace=5}Do your duty, come what may.
{cps=50}We'll work with what we've got.
{cps=50}Sire, if I understand the situation correctly, we are in desperate need of allies.
{cps=50}Correct.
{cps=50}Sire, it may sound strange, but during my visit to the Conciergerie to meet the Dauphin, I...{w} Made some new acquaintances.
{cps=50}Go on...
{cps=50}There is a large gang of routiers - the same ones that are operating in the outskirts of Paris - hiding in the Boulogne Forest...
{cps=50}Sure, they are brigands and murderers, but for money they are willing to fight on any side - including ours.
{cps=50}And we're in no position to lightly discard potential allies.
{cps=50}And it just so happens that their captain owes me one.
{cps=50}Sure, they are brigands and murderers, but we're in no position to lightly discard potential allies - no matter who they might be.
{cps=50}I think we should enlist their help, sire.
{cps=50}Hmm. Dealing with bandits is the last thing I'd want to do, but you're right.{vspace=5}We can't afford to get all ethical.
{cps=50}We can settle all scores later.
{cps=50}Go talk to those 'new acquaintances' of yours. If they're willing to take our side, I'll accept their support.

{cps=50}Now, if you don't mind, I'd like the person standing behind you to stop hiding under that hood.
{cps=50}His face strikes me as suspiciously familiar...
{cps=50}Sire?!{vspace=5}{w}I haven't recognized you!
{cps=50}Yet I surely have recognized you, guy-who-spoils-all-plans. No fancy French armor could ever hide that dumb peasant mug of yours.
{cps=50}I had a feeling that this whole story smelled like shit.
{cps=50}And as one simple rule of thumb says - if it smells like shit all of a sudden, then either you are being served English cuisine, or it is Northampton lurking somewhere nearby.
{cps=50}Good to see you too, de Roche.
{cps=50}Naturally, I'd much rather see you with a slit throat or a crossbow bolt in your forehead...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9A9}Northampton pauses and gives you a meaningful glance.
{cps=50}But it is what it is.
{cps=50}So it's all your doing, eh, old chap?
{cps=50}You're flattering me.
{cps=50}Jean has created an army of enemies for himself on his own - all I did was make a couple of good propositions to a few respectable people.
{cps=50}However, the idea of sending you to Brittany, using Étienne Marcel to depose the king, and then blaming it all on the machinations of the young Dauphin is indeed mine.
{cps=50}I thought His Grace the King of Navarre mentioned that this was his plan.
{cps=50}A good plan often has more than one father.{vspace=5}{w}Just like you do.
{cps=50}Very funny.
{cps=50}If one could win battles with witticisms alone, you'd have conquered the entire France by now.
{cps=50}Yet wagging a tongue does naught when waging a war.
{cps=50}The only mistake I made was letting Charles try to negotiate with you.
{cps=50}I should have known you wouldn't agree to it. Even despite what happened with de Montfort.
{cps=50}Do your duty...
{cps=50}Come what may.{vspace=5}Yes, I know it. The motto of naive simpletons who are unable to think for themselves.
{cps=50}I play the cards I am dealt, but if I have to pull an ace out of my sleeve in order to win...
{cps=50}Then why not do just that?
{cps=50}Pull your ace out then, if you've still got one.
{cps=50}I am afraid that's it for now.
{cps=50}For now, then?
{cps=50}Well, you know how it is... Ideas come and go. A good plan requires inspiration.{vspace=5}{w}But an inquisitive mind will always come up with something.
{cps=50}You're being extremely optimistic for a man who is one step away from the gallows.
{cps=50}That one step still needs to be taken first.{vspace=5}{w}And I was just planning on taking a little break from all the walking.
{cps=50}Fifty years.
{cps=50}Fifty is far too much.{vspace=5}{w}Ten.
{cps=50}Twenty five.
{cps=50}Fifteen.
{cps=50}Twenty.{vspace=5}{w}You're in no position to bargain.
{cps=50}Fine. Sounds fair.
{cps=50}I swear that for the next twenty years neither I nor the new King of England, Edward the Fourth, will interfere in the internal affairs of the French kingdom.
{cps=50}I accept your oath.{vspace=5}{w}My men will ensure your safe return home.
{cps=50}I was pleased to see you, Jerome.{vspace=5}{w}And I'll be even more pleased, knowing I'll never see you again.
{cps=50}Likewise, William.
{cps=50}I hope you won't have to regret not accepting Charles' offer.
{cps=50}And why are you looking so down in the mouth, [name]?
{cps=50}Cheer up.{vspace=5}{w}Sure, you might now have to eat frogs for dinner, but at least the lasses here are hot.
{cps=50}Be well, knight.
{cps=50}The last of the pressing problems was the matter of the routiers, who, having taken part in the rescue of the king, were no longer hiding in the forests, but were now present in the capital and posing selves as nearly heroes and masters of the city.
{cps=50}The last of the pressing problems was the matter of the routiers. After the massacre that had taken place in the capital, as well as the significant reduction of the king's already not so numerous troops, the profit-seeking mercenaries were no longer operating just in the surrounding forests and roads, but were now also visiting Paris itself.
{cps=50}First, I believe we all owe you a big thank you.{vspace=5}{w}Lord Keeper of France.
{cps=50}I bet Charles offered you an alliance and a very fat slice of the pie.
{cps=50}That he did.
{cps=50}And yet you still refused.
{cps=50}Indeed.
{cps=50}...{vspace=5}{w}May I ask why?
{cps=50}Ha. You sound as if you're upset and I should have agreed.
{cps=50}No.{vspace=5}{w}But your views are an open secret by now.
{cps=50}Charles' attempt to win you over to his side wasn't stupid.{vspace=5}{w}It was a deliberate and logical move.
{cps=50}What was his miscalculation?
{cps=50}He offered too little money? Offended you somehow? Wanted to pin everything on the Dauphin?
{cps=50}There's no point in this questioning, Raglan.{vspace=5}{w}We've known each other for a long time, and you know damn well I am no traitor.
{cps=50}If I have taken an oath - I will follow through to the end.
{cps=50}Yes, that is true.
{cps=50}But, I tell you this as a statesman, it's always easier to deal with things that are subject to rational understanding and mathematical calculation.
{cps=50}If Charles didn't offer you enough money, that means we have to offer you more.
{cps=50}Landed estates, castles, and manors. A ducal title. A lifetime pension.{vspace=5}{w}Simple and understandable desires that make a person more predictable.
{cps=50}I'm not chasing after gold, Raglan. I serve France and her king.
{cps=50}Charles also used to say that he was acting in the interest of the French kingdom.
{cps=50}Why the hell are you interrogating me, Raglan?
{cps=50}You're the best military commander on the continent and the most popular person in the kingdom.
{cps=50}Yet, at the same time you have a long list of grievances against the king, and soon you will also have an army of your own.
{cps=50}As we put you at the head of the army heading south, we all would like to be certain that the campaign against Castile will not end with the siege of Cité...
{cps=50}Because this time there would be nobody left to save Jean.
{cps=50}I forgive you these words. But remember...{vspace=5}{w}There is no need to doubt my loyalty.
{cps=50}I am the reason Jean is still sitting on the throne and you have not become fish feed at the bottom of the Seine.
{cps=50}I'm the one who comes to the rescue of the kingdom time and time again.
{cps=50}Every last Jacques in the farthest corners of France knows my name, and there are far more toasts to my health than to the king's.
{cps=50}If I wanted to raise a rebellion and overthrow Jean - I would have done it long ago, with or without the routiers.
{cps=50}My words were inappropriate.{w} Forgive me...{vspace=5}{w}Friend.
{cps=50}Engaging in politics is like drinking poison slowly.{vspace=5}Isn't that what you once told me?
{cps=50}That's right, Guillaume.{vspace=5}{w}That's right.
{cps=50}The Routiers are ready to help us, sire.{vspace=5}{w}They're on our side now.
{cps=50}Good news.
{cps=50}This seems to be the situation where I'm willing to shake hands even with the devil himself, so long as he'll lend me his shoulder.
{cps=50}Well then, let's hope we will not come to regret this alliance too much.
{cps=50}I managed to free some of the city guards from captivity, sire. They're on our side now.
{cps=50}That's great news.{vspace=5}With such forces, we just might have a chance.
{cps=50}Go talk to those 'new acquaintances' of yours. If they're willing to take our side, I'll accept their support.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [uneasy_alliance.name!ti].
{cps=50}This might sound strange, but I've got an idea.
{cps=50}Let's hear it.
{cps=50}I found out that the rebels had seized the barracks of the city guard and are supposedly holding many prisoners from among the guards there now.
{cps=50}If we were to free them, we would have men to replenish our ranks.
{cps=50}I'm not sure that's a good idea, [name]. It sounds extremely risky.
{cps=50}The lack of manpower is exactly the reason I don't wish to stick my nose too deep into the city.
{cps=50}And the guard barracks are a stone's throw from the Cité. It's practically the center.
{cps=50}If the rebels are indeed mostly busy besieging the royal castle and pillaging the rest of the city, the barracks are unlikely to be too well guarded, but...
{cps=50}But?
{cps=50}But it's still a great risk.{vspace=5}The fate of the kingdom is at stake here, not just my life or yours.
{cps=50}I can't afford to lose my detachment to an outright gamble.
{cps=50}If Charles wasn't on our side - then yes, the barracks would be our only option. And we'd have to take that risk.
{cps=50}However, that is not the case.
{cps=50}Sire, I've been to the city and seen everything with my own eyes. Trust me.
{cps=50}I won't need many men - I'll get everything done with my own squad.
{cps=50}All right. You haven't let me down in the past, and I have no reason not to trust you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (de Roche) check passed!
{cps=50}If you say you'll pull this off - you will.
{cps=50}Get your men and get going.
{cps=50}I'll await your return along with good tidings.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [city_guards.name!ti].
{cps=50}[name]. No.
{cps=50}That is my final decision, and that's an order.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (de Roche) check failed!

{cps=50}However, as soon as you leave the confines of Navarre, unpleasant surprises start appearing one after another.
{cps=50}And you are no exception.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance check failed!{vspace=5}Fatigue level increased!
{cps=50}You are one of the few who are resilient in the face of adversity.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance check passed!
{cps=50}Burdened by countless skirmishes with the Moors, as well as constant logistical and supply difficulties, de Roche's troops reach the vicinity of the Castilian capital much later than planned.
{cps=50}However, despite logistical and supply difficulties, as well as constant skirmishes with the Moors, de Roche manages to maintain a high tempo of movement and reaches the outskirts of Burgos before Pedro has time to complete his military preparations.
{cps=50}Despite de Roche's skill in managing troops, the scales are increasingly tipping in favor of the Castilians and their numerous allies.
{cps=50}Despite your courage and de Roche's skill in managing troops, the scales are increasingly tipping in favor of the Castilians and their numerous allies.
{cps=50}The battle does not last even two hours and ends with a complete defeat of the Castilians.
{cps=50}At first, you keep dreaming of returning to France and even start saving up for the return trip. However, money accumulates slowly and the required sum is large.
{cps=50}I'm glad it ended this way, [name].
{cps=50}It is a good death.
{cps=50}Certainly better than getting stabbed in the back with a dagger by some hypocritical conspirators.
{cps=50}Or succumbing to old age in prison, where you got put away on suspicion of treason you never planned.
{cps=50}So be it.{vspace=5}{w}I've lived long enough, and I've done my best.
{cps=50}The sky over the French kingdom is clear - which means I've got my job done.
{cps=50}Take care of Eva, [name].{vspace=5}{w}She is an angel, and she is all I have.
{cps=50}The fact that she chose you already says it all, but now I am certain...
{cps=50}She made the right choice.
{cps=50}Live a happy life.
{cps=50}It wasn't easy to buy you out from Pedro, but luckily, I know a thing or two about diplomacy - unlike my father.
{cps=50}I'll tell you right away, I don't have any special feelings towards you or the late Guillaume.
{cps=50}Yes, I considered him my friend. And he publicly swore an oath to protect me and, if necessary, to sacrifice his life for me.
{cps=50}In fact, however, he threw me into prison on false charges without a second thought. He didn't even let me say a word in my defense.
{cps=50}But he did save you, sire...
{cps=50}He saved not me, but my father and his own honor.{vspace=5}{w}Getting me out of prison was just a fortunate side effect of his conflict with Charles.
{cps=50}If Charles hadn't snatched me out of the Conciergerie, I'd probably still be staying there.
{cps=50}Sire...
{cps=50}Quiet. I'm not interested in this conversation, and I'm not here to find out the true motives behind Guillaume's behavior.
{cps=50}Like I said, even though he ultimately betrayed my friendship, he had still been a friend to me for many years before that.
{cps=50}And so, releasing you from Castilian captivity is my way of drawing a line under my relationship with him.
{cps=50}Last time we met, I said some things I shouldn't have, but that was just due to emotions.
{cps=50}I'm not an unforgiving or vindictive person. But I have never been and will never be indebted to anyone.
{cps=50}And your freedom is proof of that.
{cps=50}Now I suggest you leave the confines of my future kingdom.
{cps=50}You're a persona non grata here in Navarre. Back in France, however, you're a hero.{vspace=5}{w}So I believe that's where you should return.
{cps=50}Oh, and one more thing.{vspace=5}{w}...{vspace=5}{w}I am familiar with Eva.
{cps=50}You are a lucky man, for there is no other girl like her in the entire French kingdom.
{cps=50}Paris, still licking its wounds after recent events, welcomes you with a peal of bells and crowds pouring into the streets to meet their hero - defender of royal honor, expeller of the routiers, and keeper of France.
{cps=50}Looks like someone has been watching your career with great interest.
{cps=50}Jean doesn't like to learn new names without great necessity, so you must have impressed him immensely with something.
{cps=50}Or maybe he has actually changed.
{cps=50}Raglan wrote to me that during our time in Navarre he had managed to persuade the king to reduce taxes for the peasants for the coming year and to sit down at the negotiating table with the representatives of the merchant guilds.
{cps=50}It's a little early to rejoice just yet, of course, but it's certainly a good sign.
{cps=50}And if you add to that the fact that he had previously pardoned the Dauphin, whom he wanted to leave in the cellars of the Conciergerie to rot, the picture gets quite optimistic.
{cps=50}They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but our pooch has been demonstrating impressive intelligence of late.
{cps=50}You better not tell Raglan I said that.
{cps=50}Otherwise, I'll head straight to the Conciergerie after the royal audience.{vspace=5}{w}And occupy the Dauphin's cell before its bunk gets cold.
{cps=50}Well, [name], has the cat got your tongue? Or are you that excited to get a chance to have a word with the King himself?
{cps=50}It is a great honor, sire.
{cps=50}But truth be told, I'm far more excited about seeing Eva again soon.
{cps=50}A fine answer, son.{vspace=5}{w}As they say - this was a test. And you passed.
{cps=50}You know, the fact that she chose you already says it all, but now I am certain...
{cps=50}She made the right choice.{vspace=5}{w}And I'll be glad to give you my blessing.
{cps=50}Along with some fatherly advice, of course.{vspace=5}{w}I know what you youngsters can be like.
{cps=50}But all that can wait until later. Just because Jean has mellowed out a bit doesn't mean we can keep him waiting.
{cps=50}Come on.{vspace=5}Let's hear the king tell us how well you and I have done.
{cps=50}As you watch de Roche enter his carriage, you take another look around the square and the cathedral.
{cps=50}Greetings... Sire?
{cps=50}I'll start with the good news.{vspace=5}{w}The crown has no quarrel with you.
{cps=50}You have fought nobly for the honor and interests of the French king and now deserve a reward, which you will surely receive.
{cps=50}Several plots of land with an annual income of around fifty thousand florins and the title of count should be a worthy compensation for your labors...
{cps=50}As well as a generous payment for your loyalty.
{cps=50}Sire, I'm not sure I understand...
{cps=50}To engage in politics is to drink poison, [name].
{cps=50}I don't want to and won't spell out the obvious for you. You are not a fool and should understand it all on your own.
{cps=50}Guillaume is my friend. I've known him longer than you've been breathing, and I wouldn't do this if I could.
{cps=50}But alas.
{cps=50}I...{vspace=5}{w}I understand.
{cps=50}I've trusted your discretion.
{cps=50}Look at such things philosophically - the end of one story is always the beginning of another.
{cps=50}Don't repeat the mistakes of your predecessors, and you will be able to not only replicate, but also surpass their accomplishments.
{cps=50}But what shall I tell Eva, sire?
{cps=50}Eva?{vspace=5}{w}The truth, of course.
{cps=50}About the poisoned dagger of a dastardly assassin.{vspace=5}The insidious revenge of Charles of Navarre.
{cps=50}Politics is poison, [name].{vspace=5}{w}If you don't want to get poisoned - keep away from it.
{cps=50}Raglan keeps his promise, and the king generously bestows you with money and lands and elevates you to a count.
{cps=50}I can't betray de Roche.{vspace=5}{w}This is wrong and dishonorable.
{cps=50}There are no such things as 'rightness' or 'honor' in politics, [name].
{cps=50}But, as it has already been said, I'm not going to lecture or admonish you.
{cps=50}You have done much for the crown, and now I, on behalf of the king, would like to take all the necessary steps to do things right by you.
{cps=50}I trust your discretion.
{cps=50}Discretion cannot be an excuse for cowardice and betrayal.
{cps=50}In that case, you have two options.
{cps=50}The first is to just vanish. Leave the capital and the royal service, quietly live out your life somewhere in the fringes of the kingdom.
{cps=50}In Cambrai, for instance.{vspace=5}{w}I know you have someone there to return to.
{cps=50}And Eva will be more comfortable in your care.
{cps=50}We both know her character, so it would be better if she had someone around to keep her from making reckless decisions.
{cps=50}As I said, the crown has no quarrel with you. So if you're willing to stay out of royal affairs, we can part our ways here and now.
{cps=50}Once and for all.
{cps=50}And what is the second option?
{cps=50}Alternatively, if your notions of honor, loyalty and all that other stuff don't allow you to accept any of the options I've offered...
{cps=50}You can take a risk and go against the king's will.{vspace=5}{w}And see where that road takes you.
{cps=50}In that case, my service to the French king is over.
{cps=50}I no longer care about what happens in Paris, and I hope the crown no longer cares about me and Eva.
{cps=50}So be it.{vspace=5}{w}On behalf of the king, I thank you for your service.
{cps=50}Leaving Paris behind, you head northeast - to the very place where this all began.
{cps=50}Her and your yearning for just retribution never goes away, but, over time, you realize that sometimes the best way to exact revenge is to simply live a happy life - not to go against fate, but, as de Roche willed, to love it instead.
{cps=50}I'm willing to leave the kingdom.{vspace=5}{w}But only together with de Roche.
{cps=50}Welcome to Navarre, [name].{vspace=5}{w}I'd forgotten how hot it is in these parts...
{cps=50}Yeah, you and I are a long way from home...
{cps=50}I'm a man of war, of course, but age is apparently starting to take its toll.
{cps=50}I feel like I've aged about five years in the last month alone.
{cps=50}You've dragged a kingdom out of the abyss on your shoulders, sire.{w} More than once, in fact.{vspace=5}{w} And dragging an entire kingdom on your own is no light burden.
{cps=50}From your lips to God's ears.
{cps=50}Anyway, after this campaign, I'm definitely going to require rest.{vspace=5}{w}And I think you will, too.
{cps=50}Eva must have been waiting for you for a long while.
{cps=50}What is our plan of action, sire?
{cps=50}As I understand it, we're in for a campaign in Castile...
{cps=50}King Pedro of Castile, as you may know, has personally insulted Jean by first depriving his cousin, Blanca of Bourbon, of her freedom and then of her life.
{cps=50}Pedro has a serious adversary in Castile itself - his half-brother Enrique of Trastámara - Henry, that is, in our languages.
{cps=50}Henry is willing to become a staunch ally of Paris if Jean will help him overcome his brother and ascend to the throne.
{cps=50}He's also popular with the people, so we won't need to act as his chain dogs.
{cps=50}So it's just a rather small matter of defeating Pedro?
{cps=50}Yes. But don't be misled - Pedro is powerful, brave and ruthless.
{cps=50}His ascent to the throne of Castile was so swift and bloody that behind his back he is referred to as none other than Pedro the Cruel.
{cps=50}He has also got a plenty of allies.{vspace=5}{w}The Portuguese king, the Moors of Granada, the English from Aquitaine.
{cps=50}Our arrival in Navarre came as no surprise to him, so they will all be coming to his aid shortly.
{cps=50}Charles is still technically the King of Navarre, and given the... specifics of his current relationship with Jean, we can't rely on the active help of Navarrese forces.
{cps=50}But truth be said - he has got barely any troops here anyway.
{cps=50}The routiers are a serious force, especially as long as they are paid well and on time.{vspace=5}{w}But it will be very difficult for us to win in a clash with the combined forces of Pedro and all of his allies.
{cps=50}In that case, what's the plan?
{cps=50}I'm still working on the plan, and it will take me some time to decide on a strategy.
{cps=50}There are two things you can do in the meantime...
{cps=50}Firstly, ruffle their feathers a bit with small raids - my spies have revealed the location of some of Pedro's forces, so we know where to hit.
{cps=50}And secondly, play a dirty trick on the English. They have got only a small force in Castile at the moment, but another detachment has already set out to Pedro's aid from Aquitaine.
{cps=50}They'll take their favorite route - across the Pyrenees.{w} And there aren't many roads...{vspace=5}{w}And not so many wells.
{cps=50}I don't think any further explanation is necessary.{vspace=5}The locals won't be thrilled, obviously, but war is war.

{cps=50}Catching the English off guard, you crush their squad.
{cps=50}Having won, you return to Navarre...
{cps=50}As you find yourself under the sizzling Andalusian sun in the depths of Iberia for the first time ever, you feel as if you are starting to literally boil alive inside your armor...
{cps=50}As you find yourself under the sizzling Andalusian sun in the depths of Iberia for the first time ever, you realize you did the right thing by forgoing the heavy armor.
{cps=50}You utterly rout the squad of Granadan Moors...
{cps=50}After a while, you manage to track down the Castilians. However, a sandstorm breaks out as soon as you catch up with them.
{cps=50}You decide to attack the Castilians despite the storm...
{cps=50}You decide to retreat, allowing the Castilian squad to slip away.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Time lost: 3!
{cps=50}You defeat the Castilian squad...
{cps=50}I hear you've already taken on the task of crushing Pedro's allies. That's a good start!
{cps=50}Of course, this is just the first step, but such work is certain to bear fruit.
{cps=50}I hear you've already taken on the task of poisoning the wells. That's a good start!
{cps=50}So how's it going with the wells and squads of Pedro's allies?
{cps=50}I advise you not to delay. If we miss our chance to defeat the Castilians peacemeal, we will have a very hard time afterwards.
{cps=50}I'd love to say I have good news for you, but I'm afraid I don't. It's quite the opposite, in fact.
{cps=50}Coming here, I assumed Pedro would have eyes and ears in Navarre - and I turned out to be right.
{cps=50}But hell, I couldn't have imagined the real extent of his agent network.
{cps=50}His spies are literally everywhere - under every rock and around every bush or corner.
{cps=50}I thought we had quite a few agents in these parts as well...
{cps=50}I've got people on the inside, that's true. Plus, some of those who used to serve Charles are working for me now.
{cps=50}But they all have their work cut out for them. Behind every unit of Castilians and their allies that is marked on your map, there are days of painstaking and dangerous labor of my agents.
{cps=50}And sometimes even blood of some of them.{vspace=5}{w}So appreciate it.
{cps=50}I value their efforts. But what, in that case, are we to do about Pedro's spies?
{cps=50}Under other circumstances, I'd probably entrust you with this task. But right now you're more important to me as a commander than as a tracker, because Pedro's allies are not going to defeat themselves.
{cps=50}So here's what we're going to do. You get me someone decent from your crew - experienced, agile, and smart. And with the right equipment too.
{cps=50}No full plate armor and two-handed hammers - light and convenient armor, one-handed sword or lightweight axe. A throwing dagger and a compact crossbow with good bolts are mandatory.
{cps=50}The rest I'll organize myself.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [ratcatcher.name!ti].
{cps=50}Yes, [name]?
{cps=50}[ally!ti]? Is he really the right guy for this?{vspace=5}{w}Sounds like a name of some derelict brat.
{cps=50}I have confidence in him, sire.{vspace=5}{w}He won't let you down.
{cps=50}Good.

{cps=50}Alvar quickly scrutinizes you through narrowed eyes and readily agrees to help you, but notes that these parts are dangerous - especially for foreigners - so his services won't come cheap: [alvar_guide_price] florins for each trip.

Journey to Zaragoza
Where can I find a guide?
{cps=50}Satisfied with your clean-up efforts on the road to Rouen, de Roche gives you a new assignment to assist the bailiff's people.
{cps=50}And one must admit that they almost succeeded this time...
{cps=50}And here I just got excited about no longer having to sleep in a chainmail.
{cps=50}However, after seeing how well the city is protected and how numerous its garrison is - reinforced by de Roche's men and the squad that you have assembled, as well as the bailiff's militiamen and warriors, Geoffroy abruptly loses confidence in his forces and, after standing for a couple of days under the walls of Rouen, opts to fall back to the castle of Saint-Sauveur.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Squad size and strength, completion of quests check passed!

{cps=50}The king spoils relations with the English - you are the one who has to drive them out of France.
{cps=50}The king allows Normandy to rise in rebellion - you are the one who has to deal with Geoffroy.
{cps=50}The king lets the routiers run rampant - you are the one who is sent to restore order.
{cps=50}I was glad to see you, Jerome.{vspace=5}{w}And I am even more glad I'll never see you again.
{cps=50}The bailiff thanks you for the help and informs you that this should suffice to restore his men's combat capability.
{cps=50}I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not going to help for the sake of mere 'thanks'.
{cps=50}You want to sell out to the highest bidder, eh?
{cps=50}Hm...
{cps=50}The Duchess is a difficult target. She is well guarded, and Rennes itself has been turned into a military camp, with constant battles raging around it.
{cps=50}I'll tell you straight up: don't kid yourself. We can manage the infiltration without your help.
{cps=50}But you could save us a lot of time and effort.{vspace=5}{w}So we're willing to hear you out.
{cps=50}You don't look like deeply religious folks, and therefore you're here for the money.
{cps=50}And something tells me this isn't about a handful of florins.
{cps=50}As one of my friends used to say: where two people can make good money, there is something for the third person to find as well.
{cps=50}Know what I mean?
{cps=50}Do you have a plan yet?
{cps=50}We do. Give your men some assignment and get them someplace far away from here.
{cps=50}After that, we'll wait until nightfall and the three of us will return to the city. The guards will recognize you and let us through the gates.
{cps=50}It is all thought out. We'll wait until nightfall, and the three of us will return to the city. The guards will recognize you and let us through the gates.
{cps=50}And then it's simple.{vspace=5}{w}We infiltrate the ducal residence, kill Olivia, embark on a ship and vanish into the darkness.
{cps=50}Sounds like a good plan.
{cps=50}After sending your men to scout the distant outskirts of Rennes, which should take them at least two days, you wait until dark in the company of Grace and Glory.
{cps=50}What a bitch!
{cps=50}That bastard almost took my eye!
{cps=50}And this goddamn crossbow's jammed again.
{cps=50}And where did that skank learn to swing a sword like that, anyway?
{cps=50}Now I see why no one wanted to take this contract.
{cps=50}And you kept saying - easy money, easy money...{vspace=5}{w}I'll be damned if I ever follow your lead again.
{cps=50}I'd rather slit the throats of thieving peddlers for a quarter of that sum than have to deal with such a... thing once again.
{cps=50}No more contracts from Avignon, you hear me, Glory?
{cps=50}No. More.
{cps=50}Come on, hold this brat.{vspace=5}{w}I'm going to cut her head off.
{cps=50}Well? Do you hear the jingle of coins yet?{vspace=5}{w}I sure do.
{cps=50}Oof, there's so much stuff I'm going to buy for myself.
{cps=50}No more compromises.
{cps=50}Weapons? Toledo steel.{vspace=5}Garments? Milanese lace.{vspace=5}Jewelry? Chains of gold two fingers thick.
{cps=50}We are rich now, friend.
{cps=50}Hell, I sure do love money.
{cps=50}Yeah.{vspace=5}{w}Too bad your feelings are not mutual.
{cps=50}You'll squander it all in a month and then drag me to some hellhole once again for another 'easy job'.
{cps=50}All right. Enough chitchat.{vspace=5}{w}We've got to hurry.
{cps=50}Lacking detailed information on how the bounty hunting business works, you learn with interest that Grace and Glory, like many of their colleagues, almost never deal with their clients directly.
{cps=50}Congratulations on another success, ladies.
{cps=50}From the looks of you, it's come at a high price.
{cps=50}But as the saying goes - the greater the effort, the sweeter the reward.
{cps=50}That crazy broad has almost sent us to the afterlife, Tarrare.
{cps=50}And this thing got jammed again at the worst possible moment.{vspace=5}{w}Last time you told me it was properly fixed.
{cps=50}I'm just a middleman, Glory.{vspace=5}My men took the crossbow to the master for repairs, and he swore that all the issues were eliminated.
{cps=50}I don't know who swore to you and by what, but it was Grace and I who almost got eliminated.
{cps=50}So screw the repairs.{vspace=5}I need a new piece like this.
{cps=50}Every whim for your money.
{cps=50}You could afford ten of these with the money you've just made.
{cps=50}Speaking of money.{vspace=5}{w}Am I correct in assuming that the bounty should be split between...{w} Three?
{cps=50}Yes. This man's name is [name] and he helped us eliminate the duchess, for which he was promised a share of our reward.
{cps=50}And bounty hunters keep their word.{vspace=5}{w}No matter what anyone says about us.
{cps=50}It is all here, down to the last florin. You can count it.
{cps=50}No need. We've known each other for a while.{vspace=5}{w}You've never let us down so far.
{cps=50}Just as you have never failed me.{vspace=5}{w}Which is worth a lot in our business.
{cps=50}So what are your plans?{vspace=5}{w}I've always got lots of work available. Especially for real professionals.
{cps=50}Count me out. I may have lost my beauty, but...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}She plays with the pouch, tossing it in the air.{/color}{vspace=5}It was clearly worth it.
{cps=50}I'll take a year or two off. And then, when the money runs out, maybe I'll show up.
{cps=50}Pf-f. A year...{vspace=5}You'll waste it all in a month, and then you'll come begging to me again.
{cps=50}As for me, I'm always willing to consider worthwhile offers.
{cps=50}I won't lie though, I am going to be a little more selective in my choices from now on.
{cps=50}There's no need to worry about scars. Money, especially in a quantity like yours, opens all kinds of doors.
{cps=50}Maître Grimaldi is in Paris right now. The man has got magic hands, so he can fix you both up in no time.
{cps=50}His services don't come cheap, but you can afford them now.
{cps=50}I'd be glad to introduce you.
{cps=50}As for contracts, offering those is my business.
{cps=50}Yet, if this {color=#A9A9A9A9}- Tarrare points at the pouches of gold in your hands -{/color} seems like untold riches to you, then my new offer may surprise you.
{cps=50}Surprise you greatly.
{cps=50}Have a nice day, Tarrare.{vspace=5}{w}I'll see you when I see you.
{cps=50}What a strumpet.
{cps=50}Let's do the usual. I'll take a week off, and then I'll stop by and see what you've got for me.
{cps=50}See you around, Tarrare.{vspace=5}{w}It was nice to meet you, [name].
{cps=50}We made a good team back in Rennes. Maybe one day our paths will cross again.
{cps=50}Looks like it's just us left.{vspace=5}{w}[name], right?
{cps=50}Since Grace and Glory do business with you, you can certainly make something of yourself.
{cps=50}I wouldn't mind putting you to the test, so let me know if you need work.
{cps=50}My servants will show you out.
{cps=50}Having no clear idea of what to do next, you decide to stay in Paris for the time being and rent a house.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}500 florins lost!
{cps=50}You are not interested in this offer, and so you decline.
{cps=50}Tired of running petty errands, you decide to talk to Tarrare about a truly serious mission.
{cps=50}Yeah, Glory, that's impressive.{vspace=5}{w}To squander that kind of money in - how long has it been? two weeks? - one'd have to be a big-time carouser.
{cps=50}Told you so.
{cps=50}These have been the best two weeks of my life.{vspace=5}{w}And now...
{cps=50}And now you've turned into a beggar once again.{vspace=5}Asking me to lend you a hundred or two florins and willing to take any job you can get.
{cps=50}Just like I said before.
{cps=50}Ladies. Stay calm.
{cps=50}You're all here for the same reason. Which means there is nothing to split.
{cps=50}Glory, you're interested in big money?{vspace=5}I know how to make it.
{cps=50}Grace, you're here for a new contract?{vspace=5}I have what you seek.
{cps=50}[name]. It's easy to guess what you're here for, too.
{cps=50}Is that the guy from Rennes? What the hell is he doing here?
{cps=50}Don't be hasty, Glory.{vspace=5}{w}The contract in question is somewhat similar to your previous job.
{cps=50}Aside from the crazed occult duchess, of course.
{cps=50}Otherwise, the situation is quite alike: a well-fortified city with ongoing hostilities around it. Plus, a heavily guarded target hiding in a citadel.
{cps=50}Of course, if you say it's a two-person job, then I won't argue with you.{vspace=5}{w}No offense, [name].
{cps=50}But this is a very serious matter, and failure is not an option. So I would prefer to entrust this mission to three people rather than two.
{cps=50}And it'll be safer for you that way as well.
{cps=50}We don't need assistants, Tarrare. We ourselves can assist whomever you want.
{cps=50}I don't know, Glory. [name] really helped us out last time.
{cps=50}His sole value lay in the fact that he allowed us to get into the city without too much trouble.
{cps=50}Get into the city, infiltrate the ducal residence, not get lost in the labyrinth of its corridors, distract the bodyguards, and then slip away by the shortest route.
{cps=50}Sounds like a pretty decent contribution to success.
{cps=50}Still not sure about this.{vspace=5}All right - he did come in handy back in Brittany. But why do we need him now? We're not going to Rennes again, are we?
{cps=50}Speaking of which, where are we headed, Tarrare?
{cps=50}Rouen. Normandy.
{cps=50}Who's the client?
{cps=50}The client prefers to remain anonymous.{vspace=5}{w}But this person is very serious.
{cps=50}Someone who is never told 'no' and is never let down.
{cps=50}The person everyone wants to work for.
{cps=50}What about the money?
{cps=50}Same as for the job in Rennes.{vspace=5}{w}But with an extra zero at the end.
{cps=50}And who is the target?
{cps=50}Before I name the target, I need confirmation that you accept the contract and commit to it.
{cps=50}With all the consequences that entails.
{cps=50}Don't be dramatic, Tarrare. We've known each other for years.{vspace=5}{w}When we undertake a mission, there can only be one consequence: the death of the person with a price on his head.
{cps=50}So you accept the contract?
{cps=50}We do.{vspace=5}{w}All three of us.
{cps=50}Grace, why do we need this...
{cps=50}Either we take this job all together, or you can take it alone.
{cps=50}You fell in love with him or something?
{cps=50}It is the same as for you - my only love is for money.{vspace=5}{w}However, unlike yours, it is reciprocated.
{cps=50}Pf-f-f-ft...
{cps=50}All right, the hell with you. So who's our target in Rouen, Tarrare?
{cps=50}Guillaume de Roche.
Employ the services of Pablo
Exchange money
{cps=50}And then it's simple.{vspace=5}{w}We infiltrate the ducal residence, arrest Olivia, embark on a ship and vanish into the darkness.
{cps=50}Yeah, looks like our trail of corpses won't end any time soon...
{cps=50}Glory's doubts about the value of your participation in the execution of the contract are quickly dispelled when you reveal that you have already tried to take de Roche's life and are now quite familiar with his character and the habits of his bodyguards.
{cps=50}You arrive in Normandy at almost the same time as the royal army, so you blend in with a crowd of thousands of soldiers, as well as their accompanying suppliers, peasants, and sutlers - and make it safely into the city.
{cps=50}After breaking through the guards and ending up on a wall, you can't think of anything better than just jumping down from it - onto the thatched roof of one of the houses standing by the wall.
{cps=50}Uh-huh. Just yesterday I marvelled at the fact that you had never let me down...
{cps=50}And talked about how much it means in our business.
{cps=50}And here's what happens...
{cps=50}It was a fluke. We just had a lot of bad luck.
{cps=50}Bad luck?
{cps=50}The client provided you with a huge advance, gave you time for preparation, and led you to de Roche almost by the hand through his agents.
{cps=50}And yet you - all three of you! - by some miracle still managed to let him get away.
{cps=50}No need to exaggerate, Tarrare.
{cps=50}If this job was really a piece of cake, you wouldn't have sent us on it.
{cps=50}To infiltrate a city packed to the brim with soldiers in the middle of a war torn duchy and eliminate practically the right hand of the king or whoever that de Roche is...
{cps=50}Slitting some peddler's throat doesn't come even close.
{cps=50}I don't need any excuses from you, Grace.{vspace=5}You knew exactly what you were signing up for.
{cps=50}When I gave you this contract, I expected it to be fulfilled. Quickly and smoothly.{vspace=5}As required by the client's status.
{cps=50}Needless to say, de Roche's guard will now be doubled and getting to him will become even more difficult.
{cps=50}It could be tripled for all I care. That won't stop us.
{cps=50}I certainly hope so.
{cps=50}You've accepted the contract and received an advance - so the job must be done.{vspace=5}{w}As soon as possible.
{cps=50}We understand what a contract means. De Roche will die.{vspace=5}{w}But we're going to need intel.
{cps=50}I'd be happy to provide you with it.{vspace=5}{w}But the services of my spies cost money.
{cps=50}We've never had to pay for this kind of thing before.{vspace=5}{w}Aren't we in the same boat?
{cps=50}You haven't let me down before.{vspace=5}And it's not my policy to waste money on unreliable agents.
{cps=50}As for the boat...
{cps=50}I'm just a middleman, Glory.{vspace=5}{w}I don't accept contracts.{vspace=5}{w}I just pass them from the client to the contractor.
{cps=50}So there's just the three of you in this boat.{vspace=5}{w}Not counting de Roche.
{cps=50}Fine. We have indeed made a mistake and are now willing to accept the consequences.
{cps=50}How much will the information on de Roche cost us?
{cps=50}A business approach. I like that.
{cps=50}How much will it cost, you say...
{cps=50}Well, let's say, 5,000 florins.{vspace=5}{w}Each.
{cps=50}You know I squandered my share of the bounty for Rennes, Tarrare.{vspace=5}{w}I don't have that kind of money.
{cps=50}Your financial troubles have nothing to do with me, Glory.
{cps=50}But, if you're interested in side hustles, I'm always happy to offer you some.
{cps=50}Serious contracts will have to be put on hold for a while, you understand.
{cps=50}You are a scumbag, Tarrare.
{cps=50}It was good to see you too, Glory.{vspace=5}{w}I'll be awaiting you - along with your money.
{cps=50}When you leave Tarrare, you with Grace and Glory agree to meet up in a couple of days with all of your money to raise the required amount through concerted efforts.
{cps=50}Once you hand Tarrare the required sum, you receive information from him that de Roche has recently returned from Rouen and is now at his Parisian estate under heavy guard - including the king's own men.
{cps=50}It is impossible for an armed person to get inside. According to Tarrare's spies, the only way to get through the outer ring of guards is to infiltrate under the guise of ordinary laborers who deliver food to the de Roche estate and arrive there to work every morning.
{cps=50}Also, according to Tarrare, he has connections with several servants working at the estate, and, for a fee, they will be able to hide a few items in the inner grounds. Including weapons or armor.
{cps=50}So that once you get in without weapons and equipment, you could then arm yourselves with something.
{cps=50}Having safely passed the outer ring of guards, you infiltrate the territory of de Roche's Parisian estate under the guise of servants arriving for work.
{cps=50}De Roche himself, if Tarrare's intel is to be trusted, should be in his own chambers inside the estate, on one of the upper floors.
{cps=50}In order to reach him, you will have to get through several more posts of heavily armed guards in a short time.
{cps=50}You fail to break through to de Roche's chambers quickly, and the battle drags on.
{cps=50}Seeing that the guards receive reinforcements and there are no chances of success left, you take advantage of the commotion and get out of the estate's territory.
{cps=50}The three of you don't want to take a risk by staying in Paris, which the royal bloodhounds are likely to turn upside down in search of assassins, so you get out of the city and lay low in a village called Versailles.
{cps=50}After waiting a few days, you send a messenger to Tarrare with a request for a meeting, and he arrives in Versailles the following day.
{cps=50}Well, well, well.{vspace=5}Who could have imagined that one of my most successful business partnerships would end like this...
{cps=50}The contract stands.{vspace=5}{w}We promised to kill de Roche, and we will.
{cps=50}We just...
{cps=50}What?{w} You just what?{vspace=5}{w}Had bad luck again?
{cps=50}It is said that a bad workman always blames his tools, Grace.{vspace=5}{w}And the harder you work, the luckier you get.
{cps=50}We've just made a mistake.
{cps=50}There's a good saying for this occasion, too.{vspace=5}{w}One mistake - and you are wrong.
{cps=50}And in your case it is not even one.
{cps=50}Listen, Tarrare, we're not trying to deflect blame, but this isn't an easy mission.
{cps=50}That damn de Roche is elusive as the devil.
{cps=50}Damnations and elusive devils... You're not suggesting that it's Madame de Montfort from the afterlife who's queered your pitch, are you?
{cps=50}I wouldn't be surprised.{vspace=5}{w}I wouldn't be surprised at anything by now...
{cps=50}Either way. We'll honor the contract.{vspace=5}{w}He's been lucky twice, but he certainly won't get away from us the third time.
{cps=50}Time's up, Grace.{vspace=5}{w}This contract is no longer valid.
{cps=50}What the... Look, Tarrare, I know we've done wrong, but aren't you overreaching here?{vspace=5}{w}You don't create the contracts - so you don't get to break them!
{cps=50}And who said that it was I who cancelled it?
{cps=50}I'm just a middleman.{vspace=5}{w}No more and no less.
{cps=50}So...{w} What now?
{cps=50}I hope, the client doesn't want us to return him the down payment?
{cps=50}Telling you right away, I'd rather set out to kill de Roche a third time than shell out even a single florin.
{cps=50}Glory, hush.{vspace=5}{w}Given the client's... status, the return of the down payment is negotiable.
{cps=50}We have failed the mission and are willing to make amends.
{cps=50}I personally am not going to amend anything to anyone.
{cps=50}Listen, you...
{cps=50}Ladies.{vspace=5}{w}No one is asking to be reimbursed for the advance payment. This contract has been closed by the client.
{cps=50}This one?
{cps=50}Yes.{w} This one is closed.
{cps=50}But there is another one now.
{cps=50}As I mentioned before, our mysterious client is not of the sort whose jobs can be botched.
{cps=50}Your situation creates a very dangerous precedent.
{cps=50}So, I think you can guess it yourselves - whose heads the bounty is now placed on.
{cps=50}We're not blind.
{cps=50}Well, that's good.
{cps=50}I know how this story ends.{vspace=5}{w}And so I am ready to make you a generous offer.
{cps=50}One hour.{vspace=5}{w}If one of you leaves this tavern with the heads of the other two before that time is up...
{cps=50}I'll guarantee his life.{vspace=5}{w}And even half of the bounty on your heads.
{cps=50}Think on it.
{cps=50}Half the bounty, he says.{vspace=5}{w}He'll surely put the other half in his pocket.
{cps=50}You have to give him credit, though...{vspace=5}{w}He certainly never loses face.
{cps=50}So what are we going to do?
{cps=50}Listen, Grace...{w}That waitress girl over there...{vspace=5}{w}She looks like you a little bit.
{cps=50}Well, kind of, yeah.{vspace=5}What of it?
{cps=50}What of it...{vspace=5}{w}Give her a couple of scars...
{cps=50}And we've got one head.{vspace=5}{w}All that's left is the other.
{cps=50}Are you serious?{vspace=5}{w}After everything we've been through?
{cps=50}Arrows have deceived...
{cps=50}Poisons have yet failed...
{cps=50}And you died at such wrong time...
{cps=50}What, we've got options?
{cps=50}[name]? I hope you haven't aimed for our heads?
{cps=50}I am no traitor.
{cps=50}Something tells me Olivia de Montfort wouldn't back you up on that one...{vspace=5}{w}Just kidding.
{cps=50}That bitch deserved to be sent to the afterlife.
{cps=50}Speaking of the afterlife...
{cps=50}Looks like Tarrare has brought a whole army here.{vspace=5}{w}The three of us fighting them means guaranteed death.
{cps=50}Any death is guaranteed.{vspace=5}{w}As a bounty hunter, you should know that by now.
{cps=50}Well then?{vspace=5}{w}Let's go, shall we?
{cps=50}As an acquaintance of mine used to say...{vspace=5}{w}The only way out of this bloody place is through the roof.{vspace=5}{w}Golden words.
{cps=50}Before his death, the bodyguard has managed to buy his boss literally just a few moments. However, those are enough to let de Roche escape through the secret door.
{cps=50}Realizing that getting out of the citadel through the front entrance - the same way you entered it - is not an option, you decide to fight your way towards one of the castle walls.
{cps=50}Having dealt with both of them, you leave the tavern with Grace and Glory's heads in your hands.
{cps=50}It looks like my long partnership with Grace and Glory has reached its finale.
{cps=50}Shocking news, I know.{vspace=5}{w}The kind that can make you lose your head.
{cps=50}However, as is often the case, the end of one partnership can easily become the beginning of another.
{cps=50}I had my doubts about you, [name].{vspace=5}{w}But now I know for sure that we'll work well together.
{cps=50}I've got a contract just for you.
{cps=50}A certain noble lord believes that his father treats him very unfairly.
{cps=50}He's furious.{vspace=5}{w}And he wants revenge.
{cps=50}I can't believe this... I think we got away.
{cps=50}Who the hell is his client if he has got an entire army to sic at us?!
{cps=50}I don't know.{vspace=5}{w}And I don't want to know.
{cps=50}We've escaped Tarrare's clutches, and that's good enough for me.
{cps=50}Well, 'escaped' is an overstatement.
{cps=50}Everything north of the Loire is basically his land. We won't be safe until we get as far away from here as possible.
{cps=50}And where do you suggest we escape to?
{cps=50}I don't know. To the south.{vspace=5}{w}Orleans-Poitiers-Limoges-Bordeaux and then on to Navarre or Castile.
{cps=50}I have some acquaintances to stop by along the way - and it's always easier to blend in with the crowds in a big city than in the countryside.
{cps=50}It's dangerous to travel through the cities. Any town of significance in this part of the kingdom will be waiting for the three of us.
{cps=50}And what do you think?
{cps=50}I think that any plan is a list of things that will never happen.{vspace=5}{w}And we all will end up dying alone anyway.
{cps=50}They'll be looking for three people - so the first step towards not getting caught is to not walk around in threes.
{cps=50}We'll head south, each on his or her own way. And if all goes well, we'll meet up in Navarre.
{cps=50}As recent events have proven, our trio is having some trouble reaching the set goals.
{cps=50}So I think we all need to work on our solo careers a little bit.
{cps=50}Try not to get lost on the way, all right?
{cps=50}If your crossbow jams again, or if you once more squander all your money, there will be no one to save you.
{cps=50}I'll be in Navarre before you get to Limoges.
{cps=50}See you in Pamplona.
{cps=50}So we go our separate ways?
{cps=50}Looks like it.
{cps=50}Even though our collaboration may not have been the most productive...{vspace=5}{w}It has been a pleasure doing business with you, [name].
{cps=50}Hopefully, our paths will cross again.
{cps=50}I hope so too, Grace.{vspace=5}{w}I hope so too.
{cps=50}After cutting through countless hordes of bounty hunters, you leave Grace and Glory's bodies behind.
Rennes. Duke's Residence
Rouen Citadel. De Roche's chamber
Rouen Citadel interior
Rouen Citadel. Castle wall
{cps=50}You generously cover the remaining part of the required amount from your own pocket.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}4000 florins lost!
{cps=50}Even though you have enough money to cover her share, you pretend that you don't have any more money and Grace has to pay the rest.
{cps=50}Deciding that it's time to act, you attempt to break into the estate...
{cps=50}The battle drags on...
{cps=50}You fail to quickly break into De Roche's chambers and the battle drags on.
{cps=50}The battle is dragging on...
{cps=50}Fighting desperately, you fight your way through the entire estate. However, by the time you finally reach De Roche's chambers, he is no longer there.

{cps=50}Hello, hello, [name].
{cps=50}Let me guess... Looking for a little side hustle?
{cps=50}I sure wouldn't turn down an opportunity to make money.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 25!
{cps=50}Excellent, excellent.
{cps=50}Ever since Cain killed Abel, there's been no shortage of clients in my line of business.
{cps=50}There is a man with a bounty on his head. Moreover, the client is willing to pay extremely well on top of that for the fulfillment of certain... Extra terms.
{cps=50}Your target is [tarrar_target_name!ti]. He [tarrar_target_roll_description!ti].
{cps=50}The client wants our friend to be sent to the next world. By any means necessary, as long as it is certain. That's the essential term.
{cps=50}But there is also an additional one.
{cps=50}[tarrar_target_roll_condition!ti]
{cps=50}I hope you know what I mean.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [blood_money.name!ti].
{cps=50}Tired of aimlessly hanging around Paris without any career prospects, you decide to speak to Tarrare about getting a really serious mission.
{cps=50}You successfully eliminate the target, but you do not fulfill the additional term and only receive the base bounty from Tarrare.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[tarrar_quest_basic_reward] florins received.
{cps=50}You successfully eliminate the target with all the client's wishes in mind, for which you receive the full bounty from Tarrare.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[tarrar_quest_basic_reward] florins received.{vspace=5}[tarrar_quest_extra_reward] florins received.

{cps=50}You wait until the nightfall in the company of Grace and Glory.
{cps=50}And you succeed!{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility, coordination - success!
{cps=50}But you can't do it.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility, coordination - fail!
{cps=50}The noise of the protracted battle attracts the attention of several more guards.
{cps=50}At some point, an awe-inspiring knight appears among the guards...
Move to the courtyard

Search the supply closet
{cps=50}Any news, [name]?
{cps=50}Yet luckily for you, at night the cell door suddenly flies open and a shifty-looking man appears on the doorstep, constantly glancing around.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl), Reputation (sergeant) check passed!
{cps=50}Yet luckily for you, at night several other English soldiers, who have been captured and held prisoner by the French in the same place as you, organize an escape.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) check passed!
{cps=50}No miracle takes place - after the night that you, with your teeth chattering from the chill, spent lying on the ice-cold floor of the narrow cell, comes the morning along with the continuation of yesterday's torture.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl), Reputation (sergeant), Reputation (soldiers) check failed!
{cps=50}The captain of the guard briefly fills you in on the situation and shares the information he has on a gang of bandits planning to loot one of the city's food depots.
{cps=50}As you leave yet another inn where you tried to make inquiries about bandits to no avail, you bump into some hooded character.
{cps=50}His suspicious appearance immediately alarms you, and so his dastardly attempt to stab you with a dagger doesn't catch you by surprise.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility, Coordination check passed!
{cps=50}Having mistaken him for an overdrunk boozer with little awareness of his surroundings, you start scolding him. And only belatedly notice the glint of a dagger, which is plunged into your side in the next instant.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility, Coordination check failed!{vspace=5}Vitality lowered by 5!{vspace=5}Bloodloss!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}10 florins lost!

{cps=50}Your efforts yield no results...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Luck, Highwaymen in the squad, Acquaintances in Rouen and its environs check failed!{vspace=5}Time lost: 1.
{cps=50}Your efforts yield results, and bit by bit you manage to collect enough information about the gang of bandits and their suspected hideout.
{cps=50}You decide to personally participate in the apprehension of the bandits.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}You accept his offer and feed the captain of the guard false information.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 20!
{cps=50}Having no intention to quarrel with your bread and butter, you make no plans to assist the bandits in looting the depot and weakening Rouen's defenses.
{cps=50}Having dealt with the bandits, you get an opportunity to get your hands on their equipment.
{cps=50}Thanks to his extensive agent network both within the city and in its outskirts, Geoffroy receives comprehensive information about the state of the defenses - including the extremely limited forces at de Roche's disposal.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Squad size and strength, completion of quests, city food supplies check failed!
{cps=50}You manage to break Geoffroy's resistance and capture him alive. Seeing this, his men also lay down their arms.
{cps=50}Seeing that the city is lost, you hope to take advantage of your agreement with the bandits and leave the capital of the duchy with their help.
{cps=50}As you head to one of the Parisian market stalls, you are suddenly attacked by a group of bandits...
{cps=50}As you head to one of the Parisian apothecaries, you are suddenly attacked by a group of bandits...
{cps=50}As you navigate the Parisian streets, you are suddenly attacked by a group of bandits...
{cps=50}This offer piques your interest, and you accept.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}The map has been updated!
{cps=50}This offer doesn't pique your interest, and you refuse.
{cps=50}You deftly pretend to be one of the marauders and join the pillagers. After pocketing a few fancy items that caught your attention, you continue on your way.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue check passed!{vspace=5}Virtue reduced by 15!
{cps=50}You attempt to pretend to be one of the marauders, but your deception is quickly uncovered...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue check failed!
{cps=50}And you succeed!{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Agility, coordination check passed!
{cps=50}The epidemic issue at the bailiff's camp has been resolved.
{cps=50}This is good news. With his men, our chances of holding Rouen are greatly improved.
{cps=50}However, whereas the bailiff's men will be a great help to us in ensuring the military security of the city, they will deal quite a blow to the food supply.
{cps=50}If Geoffroy does decide on a long siege, we'll have to feed all these mouths from the city's reserves, which, as I discovered, are already not so plentiful.
{cps=50}But all we have to do is wait for the king's main forces to arrive, and he'll be here in a month, two at the most. That's not much time.
{cps=50}Is that so? Have you ever tried not eating for a week, [name]?
{cps=50}No? Well, if you haven't, try it sometime. And then we'll see what kind of fighter you'll turn out to be on the eighth day of starvation.
{cps=50}Such things can never be left to chance.
{cps=50}So what are we going to do now? Go foraging in the surrounding villages?
{cps=50}Arrangements for organizing additional food reserves are already underway. I wasn't fiddling around while you were helping the bailiff out.
{cps=50}Also, riding through the villages and buying chickens and flour from the peasants is not exactly your line of work. Other men will fill the warehouses, and if you're not busy preparing for defense - you'd better go see the captain of the guard.
{cps=50}According to his reports, there is a gang in the city that is allegedly planning to profit at the expense of one of our food depots.
{cps=50}The closer the rebel forces get to Rouen, the higher the food prices will be. And if it really comes to a proper siege, a sack of flour and a basket of chicken eggs will quickly match a warhorse and a suit of armor in value.
{cps=50}Food in a besieged city is akin to water in a desert.
{cps=50}If the captain of the guard's report is to be believed, he's already one step away from catching the bandits, but - in any case - it's better to keep a finger on the pulse of such things.
{cps=50}So go pay him a visit.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added — [city_of_thieves.name!ti].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}And you succeed!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue, Prestige, Strength, Luck check passed!
{cps=50}Yet this attempt fails.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Low Virtue, Prestige, Strength, Luck check failed!
{cps=50}Having rectified the situation with motivation and discipline in the camp, you proceed to train the soldiers and, in a few intensive sessions, teach them the most important - in your opinion - things.
{cps=50}Despite the bailiff's soldiers' obvious lack of motivation and interest in training, you still decide to train them.

{cps=50}You accept his offer. [wandering_knight_container_full_name!ti] has become a member of the squad.

{cps=50}You also order your men to stay behind and guard de Roche's study.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Luck is on your side, and, after moving at top speed for a while, you manage to catch up with the assassins.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance, Coordination, Luck check passed!
{cps=50}But you fail to catch up with the assassins.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Endurance, Coordination, Luck check failed!
{cps=50}Thanks to your intervention, both assassins end up dead. However, [storyroll!ti] getting any answers from the dead does not appear possible.

{cps=50}Enraged and unwilling to admit defeat, the mercenary refuses to hand over the rightful prize to you.

{cps=50}You say that you already have a lot on your plate and refuse to help him.
{cps=50}Sire, about those two who tried to kill you...
{cps=50}I have no news regarding them, [name].
{cps=50}Raglan promised to get his agents involved, but - as you can imagine - Paris is a huge city, so for the moment we're looking for a needle in a haystack.
{cps=50}Raglan has many skilled experts in loosening tongues, but what good are they if there is no one to interrogate?
{cps=50}As they say in the Parisian gendarmerie: no body, no crime.
{cps=50}Yeah...
{cps=50}Sire, about those two who tried to kill you...{vspace=5}Raglan promised to find out who they are.
{cps=50}He did.{vspace=5}{w}However, this is the case when the answer does not bring clarity, but only raises more questions instead.
{cps=50}These two were professional assassins. Bounty hunters. Pretty well known in their circles.
{cps=50}Their contracts were obtained through third parties. They willingly undertook difficult missions that many of their ‘colleagues’ preferred to turn down.
{cps=50}In whose interests were they working, sire?
{cps=50}They had quite many clients.
{cps=50}Among the most frequent beneficiaries of their toils are Aquitanian and Flemish merchant guilds, noble houses of Italy, and the...
{cps=50}French crown.
{cps=50}I'm not sure I fully understand...
{cps=50}I don't understand it much more than you do. Palace intrigues are not my specialty.
{cps=50}If Raglan is to be believed, some of the bounties once collected by these two ‘ladies’ came from Cité.
{cps=50}And when I say Cité, I mean the royal residence.{vspace=5}Settling political scores, eliminating the undesirable people, that sort of thing.
{cps=50}And does this mean that...
{cps=50}That they were in the royal service? Maybe they were at some point.
{cps=50}The real question is - were they in it at the time they stormed your residence?
{cps=50}That's a question I have no answer to.
{cps=50}Then it looks like we're once again completely in the dark.
{cps=50}In the dark, yet not completely.{vspace=5}Raglan did manage to find something out.
{cps=50}Their last mission. According to him, our ladies - before showing up in Paris - were sighted in Rennes, where they beheaded the wife of the rebellious Duke de Montfort.
{cps=50}I'm afraid that doesn't tell me anything, sire.
{cps=50}Truth be said, it doesn't tell me much either.
{cps=50}However, that's something.{vspace=5}Who knows - maybe a trip to Rennes can shed some light on this story...
{cps=50}We'll just have to wait and see.

{cps=50}I have not broken a single oath.
{cps=50}If by 'aiding the rebels' my father means that I didn't rush headlong into slaughtering my own subjects for daring to voice disapproval of the Crown's policies, then yes, I aided them.

{cps=50}None of this is my problem now.
{cps=50}If His Majesty the King of France believes that I - his son and heir - would be of more use in a prison cell than on the throne of the Duchy of Normandy, then so be it.

{cps=50}As for Guillaume...
{cps=50}Tell him that if one morning he'll wake up and learn that the King of France has declared him a traitor and a renegade...
{cps=50}He should ask for a cell in the other wing. There's a terrible draught in here, so he would have a hard time - given his old bones.

{cps=50}Surrender, Count. It's over.
{cps=50}Your men are defeated, and your own life is now in my hands.
{cps=50}You lost.
{cps=50}Today's battle has indeed ended not in my favor...{vspace=5}{w}But this campaign is far from over.
{cps=50}Even if Oxford falls, which - I'll give you credit - now looks like the most likely development, London is still surrounded by enemies.
{cps=50}Northampton to the south, Cambridge and the Scots up north.{vspace=5}{w}Even without my resistance, the future of the Kingdom of London appears somewhat... hazy.
{cps=50}It seems to me that you need reliable allies more than humiliated, imprisoned or even dead enemies.
{cps=50}I am not waging war with the Kingdom of Scotland or the Duke of Cambridge.
{cps=50}The fact that someone isn't in a hurry to throw down the gauntlet doesn't mean they aren't holding a dagger over your back.
{cps=50}What are you getting at, Count?
{cps=50}I am getting at the fact that there are no eternal adversaries in politics. And while you may rejoice in this victory now, in the long run it could easily cost you and your kingdom everything.{w} Unless, of course, you play your cards right.
{cps=50}Let me guess...{vspace=5}{w}You couldn't beat me, so now you're begging to be my ally?
{cps=50}Begging? Heaven forbid.{vspace=5}{w}I am offering you a fair deal.
{cps=50}A deal that a smart man would readily accept.
{cps=50}Listen, Count...{w} You're backed against the wall.{w}{vspace=5}And unless you want me to smash you into it, it's time to throw up the white flag, bend the knee, and loudly repent of your sins and crimes committed against the glorious Kingdom of London.
{cps=50}.Do that. And then - maybe - I'll agree to find you a place at my court.
{cps=50}Until that happens, however, I don't think you will find such arguments that could change my mind.
{cps=50}Is that so?{w}{vspace=5}Well, it seems to me that there might be one after all.
{cps=50}How's this for an argument, bastard?!
{cps=50}I accept your offer.
{cps=50}That is a wise decision...{w}{vspace=5}Your Majesty.
{cps=50}With my help, you will easily crush your enemies and reunite the kingdom under your rule.
{cps=50}Before we get to the state matters, however, we will need to deal with the matters of a private nature...
{cps=50}Alyssa Caldwell must disappear.{w}{vspace=5}Disappear for good.
{cps=50}Given the sensitivity of the situation, I am prepared to assist Your Majesty as much as I can. I have specialists in all matters.{vspace=5}Including those so delicate.
{cps=50}I have no confidence that there are no Alyssa's spies among my own people, so...
{cps=50}I accept your assistance.
{cps=50}And that is a more than reasonable choice.
{cps=50}I anticipated your decision, so I took the liberty of looking for experts who could solve this issue in advance.
{cps=50}Your Majesty, allow me to introduce you to Grace and Glory, recognized masters at fixing any problems.
{cps=50}They arrived just the other day from Brittany, where they had solved a problem quite similar to ours.
{cps=50}If they are on the case, the outcome can be considered predetermined.
{cps=50}Give us a dozen good marksmen and that Lady Caldwell of yours is a goner.
{cps=50}Since you're not privy to Grace and Glory's plans, you don't know what to expect. And so, when your horse procession is suddenly showered with arrows and crossbow bolts in some picturesque grove about halfway between Windsor and Oxford, it's no less shocking to you than it is to everyone else.
{cps=50}Before you know it, everyone around is dead.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}[ally!ti] died!
{cps=50}Before you know it, your entire escort is already dead.
{cps=50}It hurts...{w} So badly.
{cps=50}It will be over soon. Everything is almost over.
{cps=50}Hurts...
{cps=50}But only...
{cps=50}Because I...
{cps=50}Loved you so much.
{cps=50}I appreciate the offer, but this is a matter that I must handle myself.
{cps=50}As you wish, Your Majesty.
{cps=50}Dare I ask how exactly you plan to proceed?
{cps=50}We both know that Lady Caldwell - despite her young age - is quite skilled in the art of intrigue, deception and manipulation.
{cps=50}She can be extremely devious and ruthless.{w}{vspace=5}And thus, the only way to guarantee her removal from the board is to treat her with the same deviousness and ruthlessness.
{cps=50}I realize who I'm dealing with.{w}{vspace=5}I never loved her.
{cps=50}Our relationship was a temporary and mutually beneficial alliance.
{cps=50}However, its usefulness has now been exhausted.
{cps=50}And knowing Alyssa's nature, I'm well aware that this story can have only one ending.
{cps=50}An hour later, he returns to you with a report that the assignment has been accomplished and the queen has been taken into custody.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Authority check passed!
{cps=50}An hour later, he returns to you with a report that the assignment has been accomplished and the queen has been taken into custody.
{cps=50}The assignment has been carried out, Your Majesty.{vspace=5}{w}The wretch has been arrested, thrown behind bars and put on a chain.

{cps=50}Hello...{w} my king.
{cps=50}So... You probably still can't believe you've actually ascended the royal throne, right?
{cps=50}Still a little hard to believe, yes.
{cps=50}Well, get used to it. This is your new life now - audiences, decrees and state decisions.
{cps=50}And I am supposed to be doing all this?
{cps=50}Didn't you just recently explain to me that my job was to swing the sword - and you would do all the thinking for the two of us?
{cps=50}Yes, I did say that.{vspace=5}{w}And also, good job getting it through your head.
{cps=50}However, the situation has changed.{vspace=5}{w}Our position in the capital is still very precarious - and the lands under our control are enclosed in a ring of foes.
{cps=50}I certainly wouldn't mind standing over your shoulder and controlling your every decision and word, but I'm afraid it wouldn't be good for your reputation.
{cps=50}The last thing we need now is to make the new king - you - look like a spineless henpecked man, whose woman makes all the decisions for him.
{cps=50}Don't get me wrong - I personally find subservient men quite appealing, but something tells me that most of your new subjects will have a different opinion on the matter.
{cps=50}The peasants like a firm hand, and the nobles respect only strength.{vspace=5}{w}You know it all yourself.
{cps=50}So what now? Am I on my own?{vspace=5}{w}Is there really nothing we can do about it?
{cps=50}The situation, of course, could be remedied by 'legalizing' my participation in the governance of the state on the rights of the queen.
{cps=50}After all, you were just about to propose to me, weren't you?
{cps=50}That's right.{vspace=5}{w}I'll order the rings from the court artisan, and then we can get wed as soon as tomorrow.
{cps=50}Not so fast, [name].
{cps=50}I guess it may be hard for you men to understand this, but a wedding is a special day in every woman's life.
{cps=50}I've been dreaming about it ever since I was a little girl.
{cps=50}And I've thought of everything.{vspace=5}{w}Absolutely everything.{vspace=5}{w}Every single detail.
{cps=50}The dress, the ceremony, the guest list, the wedding trip...
{cps=50}And getting married in a besieged city that is packed with ragged refugees and resembles a military camp drowning in mud is simply not a part of my plans.
{cps=50}Not to mention the fact that it would be quite nice to marry the king of the entire England, not just London and its environs.
{cps=50}So what does this all mean?
{cps=50}It means, my love, that our wedding is postponed until after the war.
{cps=50}In the meantime, you'll have to take the brunt of the kingdom's management.
{cps=50}I will naturally help you to the best of my ability - it's just that I am going to be more of a consultant and mentor now, rather than a caring mommy who will do everything for you.
{cps=50}Yeah...{vspace=5}{w}Thanks for the good news.
{cps=50}Cheer up, [name].{vspace=5}You're a big boy and you're going to make it.
{cps=50}Well now, we can safely say that the first round is ours.
{cps=50}Canterbury has been driven back from the capital, London is safe, and the initiative is now in our hands.
{cps=50}It seems you're doing a fairly good job as king.{vspace=5}{w}Certainly not worse than your two predecessors.
{cps=50}And, as usual, I was right.
{cps=50}Our task now is to just keep at it and crush all those old men one by one.
{cps=50}First Canterbury in Oxford, then Northampton in the south.
{cps=50}Their age has passed.{vspace=5}Now is our time.
{cps=50}I can still count on your help, right?{vspace=5}Or do you have more important things to do now?
{cps=50}Don't be silly, darling. Of course I'll help you.
{cps=50}It's just that, as I've already mentioned, it would be best for me to stay in the shadows for the time being.
{cps=50}That doesn't sound too reassuring...
{cps=50}Stop whining, [name], it doesn't suit you.{vspace=5}{w}I told you - I'll help in any way I can.
{cps=50}Also, I have a small network of informants that I'm going to try to develop into something bigger.
{cps=50}So my people will be able to provide you with valuable information on a regular basis.
{cps=50}How are your informants doing? There's something I'd like to find out...
{cps=50}I've got eyes and ears everywhere.

And what are you going to do?

{cps=50}It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Majesty.{vspace=5}{w}My name is Cassandra.
{cps=50}My father said that I am to become your spouse.{vspace=5}{w}I shall be happy to get to know you better.
{cps=50}I shall be happy to connect my life with you.
{cps=50}I see you have already made yourself comfortable in your chambers...{w}{vspace=5}I hope everything has been to your liking.
{cps=50}Thank you, Your Majesty. The palace is simply marvelous.
{cps=50}I've had the chance to visit the royal residence in the past, but back then I wasn't anywhere near as thrilled as I am now.
{cps=50}Luxurious decoration has been here before as well, but now...{w}{vspace=5}Now there is taste.
{cps=50}And it's obviously thanks to you.
{cps=50}Is there something wrong?
{cps=50}Everything's fine.{w}{vspace=5}I was probably just expecting a little more from the capital.
{cps=50}Thank you for these wonderful stories, Your Majesty.
{cps=50}To be frank, before we met, I've hardly ever spoken to people whose craft is warfare...
{cps=50}And that's why war and everything related to it seemed to me to be a lowly, filthy, and unworthy business.
{cps=50}But now, having talked with you and heard just a fraction of what you have experienced and endured, I realize how wrong I was.
{cps=50}It looks like there is room for nobleness and love even on the battlefield.
{cps=50}I am grateful to you for opening my eyes.
{cps=50}But if anything, it should be me thanking you.
{cps=50}To be in the company of a woman like you is a reward perhaps more precious than the crown itself.
{cps=50}I'm very glad to have the opportunity to get to know you better, Your Majesty.
{cps=50}And now that we've actually got a little closer, I suggest we drop the excessive politeness.
{cps=50}We're not at a formal reception, so there's no need to address me by my title.
{cps=50}Just a name will suffice.
{cps=50}All right, [name]. In that case, I'd like you to just call me Cassandra.
{cps=50}It's good to see you, [name].
{cps=50}I'm pleased that you make time for me even though you have a lot of important state affairs to attend to.
{cps=50}War, diplomacy and trade are indeed essential, but the future queen's happiness and well-being are also very much a matter of state.
{cps=50}Perhaps even more important than the rest.
{cps=50}How sweet.
{cps=50}Well, if you really feel that way, I might have a few requests for you...{vspace=5}{w}If I may voice them, of course.
{cps=50}Anything you want. Just name it.
{cps=50}In that case, I'd like to redecorate my chambers a bit. The royal residence is luxurious, no doubt about that, but I'd like the capital to remind me of home.
{cps=50}First, I'd like to completely replace all the furniture and interior decoration. Oak looks heavy and cumbersome, which is rather depressing. Everything at home in Cambridge is made of olive.
{cps=50}I don't remember for sure, but I believe my father ordered it from Morocco because it doesn't grow in our area.
{cps=50}I'll handle it.
{cps=50}Second, the royal court is sorely lacking in music. I find it strange that there are no musicians or illusionists in the royal residence.
{cps=50}London has changed hands several times since the civil war began. Maybe they just fled.
{cps=50}Anyway, people around here haven't really been seeking out music of late.
{cps=50}P-f-f-t, war-war-war. War is boring and unexciting. The only exception is when you tell about it and there's some kind of love story.
{cps=50}In all other cases, I don't even want to hear about it.
{cps=50}Since London is now also my home, I require musicians. And, ideally, not just some random guys who can strum the lute, yet can't even put two words together, but someone who also has some interesting tales to tell.
{cps=50}I'll make arrangements right away.
{cps=50}I would be very grateful.
{cps=50}This is absolutely wonderful!
{cps=50}It feel just like home now.{vspace=5}{w}But even better.
{cps=50}Because you are right here with me.
{cps=50}Thank you for this gift.
{cps=50}Don't mention it.{vspace=5}{w}The future Queen of England deserves whatever she wants.
{cps=50}I will personally see to it that any your dream is realized before it is even voiced.
{cps=50}Thank you. {vspace=5}{w}I feel like I...
{cps=50}Like I am happy.
{cps=50}Not because of the gifts. Well, they're a part of it too, but they're small things.{vspace=5}{w}I'm happy because of you.
{cps=50}Because you turned out to be exactly who you are.
{cps=50}Not a sleazy old man, not a power-drunk hypocrite, and not a bloodthirsty lout.
{cps=50}But a noble man - even though not by birth, but by deeds.
{cps=50}I know it's not long before we get married, but...
{cps=50}But I have no more strength to hold myself back.
{cps=50}You've showered me with gifts - so now it's my turn to give you a gift.{vspace=5}{w}My love.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}The wedding organization will cost [storyroll] florins.
{cps=50}You purchase a large batch of olive wood in Morocco. The shipment is expected to arrive soon...
{cps=50}You receive news that the timber you ordered has arrived safely to England.
{cps=50}You receive the unpleasant news that a shipment of timber that was heading your way has been intercepted and plundered by Berber pirates.
{cps=50}On your orders, the most skillful craftsmen in the kingdom are working tirelessly on the new interior of the queen's chambers.
{cps=50}Thank you, Your Majesty. The palace is simply marvelous.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}The condition of the royal residence check passed!
{cps=50}And it's obviously thanks to you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationship (Cassandra) improved by 10!

{cps=50}I'm afraid that running the kingdom is turning out to be a little more difficult than I'd hoped...
{cps=50}I'm always here to help.{vspace=5}What's the problem?
{cps=50}State officials and nobles allow themselves to sabotage my orders and ignore my instructions.
{cps=50}If it goes on like this, my word won't carry any weight even within the royal residence.
{cps=50}I can feel the authority slipping through my fingers.
{cps=50}Nonsense.
{cps=50}Proper personnel reshuffles and a series of brutal public executions can solve even the biggest problems in the apparatus of state administration.
{cps=50}I am not getting along with the nobility.
{cps=50}Those snobby jerks constantly forget who's in charge.
{cps=50}The lords are not roadside ragamuffins, [name]. You have to take their opinion into account whether you like it or not.
{cps=50}Ignoring their interests is a sure road to perdition.
{cps=50}Treat them like...
{cps=50}Like a... I don't know... A guard dog!
{cps=50}No one is forcing you to bring his grubby paws to your bed, but you must regularly throw him chunks of meat and rub him on the scruff of his neck.
{cps=50}Otherwise, he'll simply stop guarding your house.
{cps=50}Very insightful.
{cps=50}Helping where I can.
{cps=50}Share the spoils of war with them, take their interests into account when distributing lands, or even exempt them from taxes - as a last resort.
{cps=50}And, of course, make lots and lots of promises.
{cps=50}As my father used to say - the worse things get in the kingdom, the sweeter the king's speeches.
{cps=50}They didn't do the old king much good.
{cps=50}He lasted 30 years on the throne, [name].{vspace=5}There's definitely something we can learn from him.
{cps=50}I am not getting along with the commoners.{vspace=5}{w}They have no respect for me.
{cps=50}That's the rabble for you - turning their noses up at everything.
{cps=50}They must be kept on a short leash, but at the same time, you need to maintain the sense of measure.
{cps=50}Peasants have a weakness for cheap tricks.
{cps=50}They're like chickens in a barn - throw them some grain and they'll forget about everything in the world.
{cps=50}It is essential, however, to do that at the right time.
{cps=50}I am not getting along with the clergy.
{cps=50}Instead of supporting me, the bishops and abbots put spokes in my wheel because of contrived grievances.
{cps=50}The Church is a sensitive subject. Unlike commoners and lords, abbots will not storm your residence with pitchforks or put a dagger in your back in case of conflict.
{cps=50}But you still shouldn't underestimate their importance.
{cps=50}The clergy may and should become your allies in running the kingdom - so if there's anyone you should make concessions to, it's definitely them.
{cps=50}For now, we'll have to make do with some demonstrative gestures.

{cps=50}Oh, so you are still alive!?
{cps=50}Heard you've had a big fight with marauders. And well, judging by the fact that you are still in one piece, and their bodies are resting in the ditch, I conclude that your initiation was successful.
{cps=50}We all started somewhere and today you had your first taste of combat. So well done, lad.
{cps=50}Have a rest and recover. But while you're drying the pants you pissed, do not forget about training - because the Scots are not some slow-witted marauders. They won't just stand and let you hit them.
{cps=50}Now sod off.
{cps=50}Oh, [name], you are still alive!?
{cps=50}We all started somewhere and today you had your first taste of combat. So well done, lad.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) increased by 5!
{cps=50}Very, very good, boy! Well, it looks like you proved me wrong, and if there are useless scrubs among my people, then you are clearly not one of them.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) increased by 10!
{cps=50}Courage is by far the most important quality for a man. But in order to become a good warrior, courage alone won't take you far - you need skill and a sober head on your shoulders.
{cps=50}Well, you will get it eventually, once you encounter someone more dangerous than a couple of frail marauders in run-down rags.
{cps=50}By the way, i've got a job for you, since you've shown yourself as a fine fella.
{cps=50}We need a set of trustworthy eyes and ears around town.{w} The Scots are coming, and we still have no idea where exactly that will be from.
{cps=50}We tried to send locals to scout, who, in theory, should know the area well...{w} but these sheep confuse the upper Thames with the lower Loire, the rear with the facade, and the right with the left, so the value of the information they brought back is highly questionable.
{cps=50}They see Scots in every gang of crooks... And one genius even tried to report back about our own convoy, which he swears was crawling with Scots.
{cps=50}Of course, we thought he was an imbecile immediately.{w} Well, immediately after we had sent a stone from trebuchet at approaching carts. Thank Lord we still don't know how to shoot propperly...
{cps=50}Otherwise it would have turned out ugly.
{cps=50}Anyway, what was I saying? You'll need to take a walk around the area and take a good sniff - doesn't it smell like a large cluster of bearded men in skirts is nearby.
{cps=50}Sire, those skirts, they are called kilts...
{cps=50}The only thing more pathetic than going to a battle in a skirt is trying to hide by pretending it's not actually a skirt.
{cps=50}Now, come on, get moving. Talk to Ruffin if you are afraid to go alone - he will give you a couple of man.
{cps=50}To keep your arse covered, so to speak.
{cps=50}You can go now.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [recon_mission.name!ti].
{cps=50}Ha, here comes the scrub! What's the matter? Did you forget which end of the sword to poke an enemy with?
{cps=50}What is it, [name]? Can't you see I'm busy!
{cps=50}Your good service to the earl did not go unnoticed and you were promoted.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You have been promoted to Man-at-arms.
{cps=50}Your good service to the earl did not go unnoticed and you were promoted.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You have been promoted to Sergeant.
{cps=50}Your good service to the earl did not go unnoticed and you were promoted.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}You have been promoted to Esquire.
{cps=50}Well, soldier? I heard you're bringing me good news?
{cps=50}Yes, sire.
{cps=50}To hell with this nonsense. Now is not the time for formalities. Get up and spit it out already.
{cps=50}There are just enough of wishing to kneel before me in this city even without you.
{cps=50}There they are, the finest of gentry!
{cps=50}Bastards watch over my door like angry guard mutts! Just look at them - they are dogs by all means, abscent loyalty.
{cps=50}Those greasy bulging carcasses with fat for brains!
{cps=50}And with sausages for fingers! Claded in gold from head to toe, hell, coiled in chains thicker than mine. All day they go around begging for provisions to quell their insatiable hunger and 'a dozen or so knights' for each of their many country estates.
{cps=50}But when it comes to collect taxes to send to London or to support our troops with coin, then all of a sudden they all weep in unison that they literally live off of scraps and have nothing spare to give.
{cps=50}We have not one thing to bring, we're all clean before the King.
{cps=50}Ha! Of course, you are. Thought about the wellbeing of our kingdom so much, they all forgot about themselves. All swelled up from famine, poor fellas.
{cps=50}Hell! It is a pity that this city isn't sitting on top of a hill, otherwise these human projectiles would have been launched down the slope at the Scots. Wouldn't have to bother with trebuchets!
{cps=50}That damn trebuchet... God spare his wooden soul.
{cps=50}If only I knew it would cause so much trouble, I'd have taken half a dozen wagons of ale with us instead. Weight is exactly the same, but would have been much more useful in battle.
{cps=50}Who am I telling this anyway? All you infantrymen do is gulping ale all day and slaping local girls' arses. I know you slackers well...
{cps=50}Anyway! Stop wasting my time, swindler - what's with the prisoner?
{cps=50}The prisoner cracked, sire. He revealed the place where the smugglers are hiding.
{cps=50}Good, good. And where is this place?
{cps=50}They made a hideout in caves by the lake to the northeast. A couple of hours away.
{cps=50}Caves, you say? Got you bastards.
{cps=50}Well, good news indeed.
{cps=50}You know, I specifically requested someone sensible to assign to this matter. Someone I could trust.
{cps=50}The sergeant gave your name. I won't lie, I almost immediately forgot it, but it does matter realy.
{cps=50}He said that you did quite well in battle and I ordered to give you a chance.
{cps=50}It seems he was right about you. So far you have shown yourself to be credible.
{cps=50}Appearances can be deceptive, but I'm ready to take a chance, because, as you know, there are not many people worthy of my attention here.
{cps=50}I would even say that they are worth their weight in gold.
{cps=50}Which means they are also get paid in gold.{w} See what I am saying?
{cps=50}All right then, listen up.
{cps=50}Here is the plan. Grab a few spry men with you, pay a visit to the smugglers and put them to knives.
{cps=50}Take no prisoners. I don't need any of them alive.
{cps=50}Personally finish off every single one of them, you hear me, no loose ends.
{cps=50}Send someone for me as soon as you all done with them. My guys will come to watch the goo...
{cps=50}To watch the place i mean.
{cps=50}And keep your hands to yourself - You are free to loot bodies but don't you dare to go around barrels.
{cps=50}You won't find anything more than contraband booze anyway. And the last thing I need here is for you to get wasted out there and to be captured by the Scots.
{cps=50}Here is your task in a nutshell. Nothing too complicated.
{cps=50}Do you understand the instructions?
{cps=50}Yes sire.
{cps=50}Good. Let's get one last thing clear right now.
{cps=50}I'm entrusting you with an important matter, and if this kind of task is beyond your capabilities, then better say so now. And I will find something nice and easy for you to do.
{cps=50}Late burgomaster, that useless fat slob, left me his kennels teeming with  huge wolfhounds - and it so happens that I am looking for someone to take care of them.
{cps=50}You can get on that if you're not ready for serious business. Because if you take the job and mess things up, you will end up in the kennels annyway. But this time as food.
{cps=50}So think carefully with that thick head of yours.
{cps=50}I won't let you down, sire.
{cps=50}Good. I am giving you a chance. Don't fail me.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) increased by 10!{vspace=5}50 florins received.{vspace=5}Quest updated!
{cps=50}And speaking of dogs. Tell my adjutant to get those fatsos over here, on your way out.
{cps=50}I will make them an offer they can't refuse.
{cps=50}Sire, I'm afraid it is not for me.
{cps=50}Those people in the caves... Smugglers or not, they hardly deserve to die like this.
{cps=50}And even if they deserve to, it won't be from my hand. I am a soldier, not a murderer.
{cps=50}So be it. I gave you a chance to break out of the filth you were born into and where you were destined to spend your entire life.
{cps=50}You refused. It's your choice.
{cps=50}Now get the hell out. And if even one living soul finds out about this conversation, you'll disappear, bones and all.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (earl) is lowered by 50!
{cps=50}Having defeated a gang of smugglers in a hard fight and making sure that all of them are all positively dead, you send one of your comrades to the earl to report the job done.
{cps=50}Congratulations on your promotion, mate!
{cps=50}The sergeant and I really hit the nail on the head when we decided to take you in.
{cps=50}Congratulations on another promotion, mate!
{cps=50}Time goes fast... It seems like only yesterday you trudged to our London camp - scrawny and hungry, with eyes like those of a beaten mutt.
{cps=50}And now you are a big man.
{cps=50}You've come to the right place then, i guess. Ha-ha-ha!
{cps=50}Ah, [name]! How's life treating you? Getting settled in at the camp?
{cps=50}Ah, [name]! How's it going
{cps=50}Doing fine.
{cps=50}Well, that's great. It is not easy to get used to life in a camp, but once you do, you will feel at home in your tent.
{cps=50}First timers always find it difficult to adapt, but over time you'll learn what's what.
{cps=50}Although many recruits, on the contrary, are rather delighted: here they get food, water, and even money.{w} The only downfall is that sometimes you have to fight...
{cps=50}But, believe me, you have way more chances to kick the bucket from typhus or diarrhea, than from a Scottish spear.
{cps=50}So no need to be afraid!
{cps=50}To be honest, I ran into a couple of problems...
{cps=50}I get it. It is not easy to get used to life in a camp, but once you do, you will feel at home in your tent.
{cps=50}First timers always find it difficult to adapt, but over time you'll learn what's what. The main thing is to arrange your day to day.
{cps=50}So here's a little present for you.
{cps=50}I nicked it from old Tom... After he was hanged for boozing.
{cps=50}I kept it for myself, but it's fine, you need it more than I do.
{cps=50}And half a hundred florins for it you can pay me later, when you have money.
{cps=50}Well thank you.{w} I guess.
{cps=50}earl gave me the job. He ordered to gather a squad.
{cps=50}And I thought you could help me.
{cps=50}Sure thing, make! The job will be done...
{cps=50}I need more people. Can you help with the search?
{cps=50}No problem, brother. Let's get somebody...
{cps=50}I've encountered an unexpected problem. I ran out of place to store my belongings.
{cps=50}What do you mean, you ran out of place? What do you even have to store?
{cps=50}You don't really strike me as a dashing warrior who's got lots of necessary armor and equipment, so if — when you say 'belongings' — you mean a collection of pretty pebbles or sturdy stiсks that you found around camp, then it's better to just throw all this rubbish into the Thames.
{cps=50}It's an army camp, not a peasant's hut, remember?
{cps=50}But lucky you, I guess. I actually should have a chest lying somewhere around here.
{cps=50}It is, in fact, the old Tom's chest, but given that Tom was hanged for boozing, let's say he 'passed' his stuff on.
{cps=50}And I inherited it, so to speak.
{cps=50}So, yes. I'm ready to settle on a token payment of half a hundred florins, for this thing.
{cps=50}Regarding the 50 florins for the chest...
{cps=50}Ready to pay back? Perfect.
{cps=50}Here. Thank you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}50 florins lost.
{cps=50}I knew I could trust you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 7!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 3!
{cps=50}I've never been to a war, so I don't quite understand what exactly I need to prepare for.
{cps=50}It would be great to get a couple of tips on what skills to practice.
{cps=50}Well, buddy, everything kind of depends on a person here.
{cps=50}You can look at any battle, as consisting of two goals: not to die yourself and kill the enemy. And your training may differ from which of these goals you prioritize.
{cps=50}Agility is a good all-round skill, which, first of all,  allows you to hit the target more often as well as to dodge enemy attacks better.
{cps=50}Agility is great and all, but it is nothing without weapon training. So if you want to hit hard without fail, then practice your weapon skills as well.
{cps=50}The more skilled you get with a particular weapon, the more lethal it will become in your hands.
{cps=50}But if it's so happens you don't have the brains for fencing techniques and stances, then don't you worry, because no one has yet canceled a good old brute force.
{cps=50}Some hefty axe or, for example, a weighty falchion, with a couple of sweeping blows can easily send any dancer-swordsman to kingdom come.
{cps=50}If, of course, you have enough strength for such blows.
{cps=50}Besides, physical strength is also useful when equipped with a shield. Knocking down an enemy with a shield bash or holding out against a powerful enemy strike - all this requires muscle.
{cps=50}Endurance and coordination are also important - any soldier can't do without them. Fatigue can turn even the most ferocious fighter into an exhausted coward, so keep that in mind.
{cps=50}Endurance determines your stamina pool, and each fully used stamina bar increases your fatigue level by 1.
{cps=50}Everyone gets tired in fight sooner or later, that much is true. But what you want is for you to get tired later than your enemy. To do this, you need to either have more endurance than him or to expend your stamina more wisely.
{cps=50}The third option, it's just to have an effective recovery - and coordination is responsible for this. The more of it you have, the more stamina you can restore and more of your fatigue can be relieved. It's all simple.
{cps=50}And, of course, vitality. No matter how brave, agile and skillful you are, at some point you will get a good kick in the snout. And when this finally happens, nothing but having a good health would save you.
{cps=50}This is especially true because some of the bastards you'll encounter use poison, and some can exsanguinate you like a pig with their dirty blows. Agility and strength won't save you from bleeding and poisoning...
{cps=50}So take good notes, brother. The more sweat you shed in camp, the less of your blood will be shed in battle.
{cps=50}Actually, I'd love to earn some extra money.
{cps=50}Extra money? It's all about money with you lately. I had no idea you are materialistic like this, my friend.
{cps=50}That's an 'L' for you.
{cps=50}Come on, don't pout. Everyone needs money, I understand.
{cps=50}Check out the traveling forge - there should always be work there in theory. But, keep in mind that if your hands grow out of your ass, then you won’t be able to earn much there.
{cps=50}At best you will be an errand boy: bring this, give that, and nip round for wine.
{cps=50}I don't mind running for wine actually.
{cps=50}Well, who would doubt...
{cps=50}Anyway, a forge is a forge, after all maybe you will learn something there in a month or two. And with your hands straightened you'll be able to earn decent money.
{cps=50}The sergeant sent me to scout around the city. We need to understand from where to expect the Scots.
{cps=50}Great. Glad to see you getting a job right away.
{cps=50}I could use a few people. Just in case, you know.
{cps=50}A few people you say? Hm...
{cps=50}In theory, I can take a couple of my guys off the guard of the camp. I don't think we're in any danger right now.
{cps=50}Especially after that huge trebuchet was set up yesterday.
{cps=50}I heard this thing can hit in thousand steps without a miss. Marvelous contraption!
{cps=50}Well... The trebuchet...
{cps=50}Okay, take this raskal. His name is Jones and he's generally a sharp lad, especially if you keep an eye on him.
{cps=50}And he also tells stories in a funny way and whistles well. So try bringing him back alive, okay? Otherwise it will be boring here
{cps=50}Did you get it?
{cps=50}Man, I asked you to get a proper antidote, not cough medicine.
{cps=50}The most that this thing can save you from is sour milk poisoning. And we, in case you forgot, don't fight milkmaids here.
{cps=50}Take this more seriously, will you, because the earl obviously will not find it funny.
{cps=50}Great work. I knew I could rely on you.
{cps=50}I will definitely mention you, when reporting back to the earl.{w} Briefly.
{cps=50}Excellent work. I knew I could rely on you.
{cps=50}Not yet. But I'm working on it.
{cps=50}Good. Just don't take too long, okay?
{cps=50}Hey you! Yes, you! I don't remember seeing you before. Whose squad are you from?
{cps=50}Nobody's. I just arrived...
{cps=50}Ah, so you are from the townspeople... Did you fall for recruiters' fairy tales? Dreaming of gold, glory and adventure?
{cps=50}Something like that.{w} What, you say I shouldn't have?
{cps=50}Well, judging by your appearance, you definitely won't become poorer, even if you try hard. Can't loose what you don't have. And here you will definitely have at least some kind of money...so
{cps=50}I like when money looms on the horizon. And the further away from here this horizon is, the better.{w} When do we set out?
{cps=50}Ha, for the first time in my life I see a militiaman who's raring to go. And we haven't even paid you a penny yet. The sergeant will definitely like you...
{cps=50}We plan to march in four or five days - when the rest of the carts with food are brought up.
{cps=50}A few more days...
{cps=50}I suggest you make use of this time - focus on your physical training or maybe take a couple of fencing lessons from someone around here.
{cps=50}And please, come up with something more decent to wear...{w} Or else you'll be a laughing stock for the Scots.
{cps=50}In short, try not to let your first fight be your last.
{cps=50}Thanks for the advice, but I'm afraid I can't afford spending on equipment right now.
{cps=50}Oh, right! Speaking about money: all recruits are entitled to a salary. No gold mountains thats for sure, but you'll certainly get a couple of florins for ale and pants without patches.
{cps=50}Sounds very enticing.
{cps=50}Alright then. Find me when you have a look around and I'll take you to the sergeant.
{cps=50}By the way, my name is Ruffin.
{cps=50}My na...
{cps=50}Don't shake the air, my friend, save your breath. See if you'll be still alive a week later, then you'll tell me.
{cps=50}Well? Did you settle in?
{cps=50}Let's go. It's time for you to meet the sergeant.
{cps=50}Ha! So is this the guy who was eager to go to war!?
{cps=50}He's the one. I haven't even said a word about the salary and he already asked me when are we setting off...
{cps=50}Really? In a hurry to die for the faith and the King, boy? How commendable!
{cps=50}Well, let's not pull the mare by the tail then. I have no idea where you came from, however since Ruffin has already kind of picked you up, I guess you are enlisted to us now. Welcome to the earl Northampton's squad.
{cps=50}Give my respects to the earl. Would he maybe like to pay me a salary though. I thought about it and decided that it wouldn't hurt if I aquire some money.
{cps=50}Eh, boy, and I thought you were different.
{cps=50}It's feudalism, my friend. Don't ask what the earl can do for you, ask what you can do for the earl.
{cps=50}Words of gold, Ruffin. However, the guy is right.
{cps=50}A scrawny ragamuffin like you, [name], could sure use some equipment... Otherwise, you will have to be crossed off the squad list even before the ink with which your name was written there dries.
{cps=50}Well, that's not much.
{cps=50}Don't get smart with me, son. You should be thankful that you got anything at all.
{cps=50}You have all the delights of royal service and army life ahead of you. Free meals, friendly colleagues, outdoor work and lots of travel. Solid benefits.
{cps=50}It's you who should pay to experience such things, not the other way around.
{cps=50}And we even offer opportunities for career growth. The earl notices good people, so if you prove yourself, then, who knows, you mights get out of the mud...
{cps=50}The earl looks after his people, that's for sure.
{cps=50}So enough of your jibber-jabber. Prepare yourself and get ready to march.
{cps=50}Consider yourself well done, if you get out of the first battle alive, and I even will personally shake your hand if you manage to kill someone...
{cps=50}Well, and if you kill two, then I might even stop thinking of you as a useless scrub.
{cps=50}Hello [name]. What's the word?
{cps=50}What's the word?! I in fact do have a word for you, buddy! I don't understand a thing of what the hell is going on here and you owe me an explanation for what has transpired.
{cps=50}Well, I guess it's kind of obvious now that the negotiations were... a distraction.
{cps=50}The plan was simple: the meeting was an excuse to gather all the important Scots in one place, poison them, and then kill them. Thus decapitating their entire army.
{cps=50}Simple and effective.
{cps=50}That means... You knew that the wine was poisoned?
{cps=50}But why then... Why did you let our guys get poisoned? You only stopped me!
{cps=50}That was the plan. If none of us would have drank this wine, the Scots would not touch it either.
{cps=50}Someone had to be sacrificed. So the militiamen were chosen for that role...{w} And the burgomaster of York. The King had long been dissatisfied with him, so the earl had instructions that the fat man is to consider expendable if necessary.
{cps=50}And what about me?
{cps=50}Well, you are my friend. If I had let you get poisoned, it would have turned out that I fought my way to you through the Scots then all for nothing. And by the way, I almost got pierced a couple of times...
{cps=50}And besides, the sergeant says that you are a decent guy and something can come of you. Basically, we like you.
{cps=50}You once told me that the earl 'looks after his people'. Maybe you're right ... But just who exactly does he consider 'people' then?
{cps=50}Definitely not me and not the guys who were treated to poisoned wine, that's for sure.
{cps=50}Oh and certainly not those poor fellows who were trampled by the cavalry in the Scottish camp or those skewered on pikes in the encirclement.
{cps=50}You're digging a little too deep, mate. I don't know what kind of feel-good fun time you expected, but this is war. The King didn't send the earl north to make friends, round dance and compete with the saints in the size of his heart.
{cps=50}War is blood. And the one who sheds more of it - wins.
{cps=50}And the one who is afraid to get off with just little blood now, will be forced spill the seas of it later.
{cps=50}I don't want to preach, but don't forget your place, [name]. It's not at random that you stomp field dirt in rags all day and the earl is entrusted by our King to manage the troops.
{cps=50}Everyone has their place, and for a reason. And if you don't understand that and respect those who are higher than you, then you will remain a nobody.
{cps=50}So, as the sergeant says, less reflexions and more determination.
{cps=50}That's all great, Ruffin, but what if you yourself one day end up in those guys' shoes. And for the sake of realizing his brilliant plan, the earl will treat you with poison?
{cps=50}I may not be much older than you, but I've seen a lot in my life already. And in campaigns like this I have been not just once or twice.
{cps=50}I'll tell you what.
{cps=50}The kingdom does not begin with you and it does not end with you either. There are things that mean and are worth much more than you, all your thoughts, reasoning and experiences combined.
{cps=50}We did not create the world we live in, and it's not for us to change it.
{cps=50}Long ago, the sergeant pulled me from out of the gutter, miserable and starving, and made me who I am now. He is like a father to me.
{cps=50}And if he is ready to give his life for the earl and his banner, then so am I.{w} End of story.
{cps=50}So stop being smart, mate, before you smart yourself into something you'll regret later on.
{cps=50}We were given an order and we carried it out. When they give us another, we will carry it out too. In the meantime, go get some rest.
{cps=50}Thank you for saving me. Twice. I owe you.
{cps=50}No need to thank. Like I said before, you are my friend. And I am sure that one day you will do the same for me.
{cps=50}At the camp, you accidentally run into Ruffin...
{cps=50}You don't look happy.
{cps=50}Really? Maybe it's because I am not happy.
{cps=50}The sergeant, from the words of the earl, told me about the war council. Looks like things aren't going as well as we all thought.
{cps=50}Let me guess - the homecoming is cancelled?
{cps=50}Canceled. It turns out that the defeated Scots are not so defeated: they set up a new camp two days' march from here. And reinforcements from the north arrive almost daily.
{cps=50}Reinforcements? How do they have so many people?
{cps=50}The worst case scenario.{w} The Frenchies.
{cps=50}French!? And what did they come here for?
{cps=50}The king has an old scores with the continent. Both he, and his father were always at odds with the Parisian crown. And it seems that someone decided that it was time to settle those scores.
{cps=50}Our reconnaissance reports that at least a few French detachments have already arrived to the north and these are not some bare-assed vine chowders like our peasan infantry.
{cps=50}Savage guys?
{cps=50}Worse. Respectable men.
{cps=50}And what does that mean?
{cps=50} That means we are in deep shit, [name]. Neck deep.
{cps=50}An Italian friend of mine has a special phrase for this kind of occasion.
{cps=50}'Plunge in guaio'.
{cps=50}That victorious attack cost us a lot of blood, and the amount of people, as it turns out, perished there - bloody hell.
{cps=50}Worse yet, the idea of robbing the Scottish carts came not just to you and me. And a bunch of people started 'celebrating victory' a little earlier than they should have. But if you and I got off with wet pants, then some people were less fortunate.
{cps=50}Several of our cavalry units ran into the retreating mercenary crossbowmen, who apparently were unaware that they lost and are now fleeing in panic.
{cps=50}So they studded our guys with bolts like hedgehogs. Didn't manage to kill everyone, thank God, but there is most definitely noone left able to hold a weapon.
{cps=50}And if you can always round up new peasants from the surrounding villages, then where to get fifty new trained cavalrymen in a couple of weeks is not entirely clear, i'd say.
{cps=50}Have we won the battle at all then? The more I listen to you, the more questions I have.
{cps=50}Yes, we did win. But that's just, as the sergeant says: 'such victories double as troubles'.
{cps=50}And now what?
{cps=50}The word has it that there will be some kind of negotiations. The earl has already instructed me to find a suitable place nearby.
{cps=50}Hmm. Good luck with your search - tell me how it went later. And I was just about to go lie down.
{cps=50}Not so fast, weasel. There is a job for you as well.
{cps=50}The Scots agreed to the negotiations, but, given the situation, there are serious suspicions that they will not play fair.
{cps=50}That means we need antidotes. And good ones. So I am relying on you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [courtside_physician.name!ti].
{cps=50}Well? Looks like I'm in your debt again.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) have been improved by 10!
{cps=50}So it would seem.
{cps=50}And what is the payment?
{cps=50}Ha! Hold your horses, brave boy.
{cps=50}Although... I won't lie, I'm impressed. There was a whole horde of them against you alone, but you did not hesitate even for a second.
{cps=50}Such courage is to be commended.
{cps=50}And truth be told, I like it when men fight for me.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) improved by 5!
{cps=50}I was sure I was fighting over dishes and furniture...{w} But I like your version too.
{cps=50}Choose for yourself: if you would rather accept spoons and mugs as a reward, then so be it.
{cps=50}If spoons and mugs are the best you can offer, then I'd rather go to the Scots for a reward. Because over the past hour and a half, the royal troops have received more damage than in the entire past week in battles. And it's all thanks to me.
{cps=50}I'm sure they'll come up with something for me.
{cps=50}You are silly.
{cps=50}I like your cheerful nature. These days it worth a lot.
{cps=50}But at the same time you have something tragic about you.{w} I see sadness and emptiness behind your eyes.
{cps=50}As if you're running from something.
{cps=50}Or someone.
{cps=50}I know so little about you.
{cps=50}I'm afraid that my story is not exactly a heroic epic, so...
{cps=50}I don't care if you have a heroic past or not. It is yours. And that is why it interests me.
{cps=50}Here's an idea: I'll work my magic on your wounds while you tell me about yourself. Deal?
{cps=50}Don't even think to refuse - you got beat up like a street mongrel. Or else, instead of medical attention, I'll give you a couple of new bruises.
{cps=50}Looks like I have no choice.
{cps=50}See, here's a good boy.
{cps=50}Come on. I am all ears.
{cps=50}What the hell do you want?
{cps=50}Hello there.
{cps=50}I wanted to... I wanted to thank you again for searching for Maria.
{cps=50}Even if it all turned out to be... for nothing.
{cps=50}Thank you for being ready to risk yourself for a stranger. Such deeds are rare these days.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) increased by 15!
{cps=50}I did what I had to. Anyone in my place would have done the same.
{cps=50}Oh, if only that was true, [name].
{cps=50}You are a great person, I see it. But being naive is dangerous.
{cps=50}People tend to worry only about their own skin, and those who think differently and blindly believe others, will definitely end up being pawns in someone else's game.
{cps=50}So don't be so quick to risk your head at someone's first request, [name]. Because, sooner or later, you won't be able to keep it on your shoulders.
{cps=50}And I would not want it to come to this.
{cps=50}Promise me that you will be careful.
{cps=50}I will be careful. I promise.
{cps=50}Thank you. I needed to hear this.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) increased by 5!
{cps=50}It's beyond my power to make such promises.
{cps=50}I do what I'm told. And if my honor or my superiors require me to risk my life, then there is simply no other option.{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Of course. It would be strange to expect a different answer.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) increased by 1!
{cps=50}Listen, I wanted to ask you something.
{cps=50}This may sound weird, but...{w} But why not.
{cps=50}Would you like to get out somewhere out of town with me? For a little walk or something.
{cps=50}The area has been pretty quiet these last few days, so if we won't go too far, everything should be fine.
{cps=50}I know a very beautiful lake nearby.
{cps=50}Sorry, but I'm afraid it's not a good time for walks.
{cps=50}So is that how it is?
{cps=50}Well, all right then.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}You're just in time! I have something for you... One delicate matter.
{cps=50}I've been able to get back in touch with the smugglers and they're ready to replenish our stock at relatively reasonable prices.
{cps=50}So I need you again as a courier.
{cps=50}This time, though, there shouldn't be any danger, and you won't even have to travel far.
{cps=50}We've already arranged everything: they'll be waiting for you on the opposite side of your camp, at the western wall. Away from prying eyes.
{cps=50}Show them this.
{cps=50}So that they know it's you.
{cps=50}Just tell them that i've sent you and there won't be any problems.
{cps=50}Can I count on you?
{cps=50}You always come to my rescue. And you don't even know how much i appreciate it.
{cps=50}Thank you. Sincerely.
{cps=50}I will never forget all that you have done for me.
{cps=50}How's business? Now that your supplies are replenished, things should be going uphill.
{cps=50}Hmm. Actually, things aren't that great. Of course, we are able to stay afloat, but the future doesn't seem promising to me.
{cps=50}But it's not in my nature to lose heart.
{cps=50}I remember someone promised to tell some dirty jokes... Does the offer still stand?
{cps=50}I've been told that I have an odd sense of humor, so I probably shouldn't.
{cps=50}Is that so? It's quite unfair - first promise, and then refuse. Especially since I kept my promise.
{cps=50}Hmm, well, considering your merits...
{cps=50}All right. Here we go.
{color=#A9A9A9}{cps=50}Freya clears her throat.
{cps=50}One brave knight decided to come face to face with the fiery horseman of the Apocalypse.
{cps=50}Quite a start! And I always thought that vulgar jokes were about haylofts, pretty girls and lustful priests...
{cps=50}Oh my God! If you keep interrupting me, I won't tell you!
{cps=50}Sorry.
{cps=50}As I said, one daring knight decided to come face to face with the fiery horseman of the Apocalypse.
{cps=50}The brave man defeated the monster in a heavy battle and, as a reward, got his flaming steed.
{cps=50}Mounted it and...well, burned to death.
{cps=50}The end.
{cps=50}Hmm.
{cps=50}And why is this joke dirty?
{cps=50}Because if I had told it in the church, I would have been burned at the stake.
{cps=50}I think now I understand why your tavern risked ruin without alcohol.
{cps=50}See. That's why it was so important for me to restock.
{cps=50}And why I'm so grateful to you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) improved by 5!
{cps=50}What!? Is it for me!?
{cps=50}It wasn't necessary at all, but... Thank you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) improved by 10!
{cps=50}About the smugglers...
{cps=50}Did you get in touch with them? Please tell me everything worked out...
{cps=50}I don't make empty promises. The deed is done.
{cps=50}Are you serious!? That's wonderful news!{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) improved by 10!
{cps=50}Truth be told, I've already said goodbye not only to the goods I paid for, but also to my father's tavern. It certainly seemed to me that in another week or two we would have to go hat in hand.
{cps=50}But then you came along.
{cps=50}Thank you.{w} Not only from me, but from my entire family.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) improved by 5!
{cps=50}Well, looks like the imminent closure has been canceled and we're back in business! I will be glad to see you among our guests.
{cps=50}I found them, but...{w} Unfortunately, things didn't go according to plan.
{cps=50}Hmmm. Looks like I overestimated your capabilities a little.
{cps=50}But what can I say? It seems that the father was once again right when he said that you can only rely on yourself.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) worsened by 5!
{cps=50}Well. May this be a lesson for me.
{cps=50}Shortly after arriving in York, you and a few other militiamen go to one of the city's taverns to celebrate your first battle.
{cps=50}How can I help you?
{cps=50}Four pints of ale for me and my buddies.
{cps=50}No problem. 15 florins for a pint.
{cps=50}What do you mean 15 florins!? The innkeeper just charged us a fiver per mug!
{cps=50}I would not be surprised if he did. My father has quite a spotty memory recently - he would have gone broke a long time ago if not for me.
{cps=50}We haven't had a delivery for several days and almost all the ale kegs are empty. So if you fancy a drink, you'll have to shell out.
{cps=50}How about a little discount, maybe?
{cps=50}A little discount? And for what that would be, I wonder? Please, surprise me
{cps=50}For the fact that we are here on behalf of the king and protecting the city and all its inhabitants - meaning, you, from the Scots.
{cps=50}Well, thanks for that, of course, but only the shortage and supply problems began just before your arrival.
{cps=50}The burgomaster threw all the smugglers out of the city as soon as he heard rummors about royal army comming here. Smuggles, who, just so you know, supplied all the local taverns with all sorts of things for cheap, and alcohol was one of those things.
{cps=50}So try to remember the taste well, when you raise a pint of ale to our beloved king. Because in a couple of days the only source of froth left in this city will be soap.
{cps=50}Is there really nothing that can be done about it? 15 florins a pint is robbery in broad daylight.
{cps=50}Why of course something can be done.
{cps=50}But only if you have the guts to do something more than to slap the tavern maids on the ass.
{cps=50}Come on, out with it.
{cps=50}I know where to find smugglers - they have a secret hideout outside the city. We used to send errand boys to them from time to time, but the roads are unsafe now...
{cps=50}So what do you say? Are you ready to take a task on or do you have more important things to do?
{cps=50}Sounds doable. I will try.
{cps=50}Really? Well, great.
{cps=50}My father often says that alcohol has a strong effect on men. But i guess its absence has an even stronger one.
{cps=50}I wouldn't say it's just the alcohol.
{cps=50}Well, it seems to me like that.{w} May I know your name?
{cps=50}My name is Freya.{w} And if something 'seems' to you, I suggest you cross yourself more often. I heard it helps.
{cps=50}Here's the map. This is where the smugglers hide. We paid them for two shipments up front, so there shouldn't be any problems with money - just tell them I sent you.
{cps=50}Clear.
{cps=50}All right then... Thanks.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Relationships (Freya) improved by 10!
{cps=50}Didn't expect you to agree to help. I thought that royal soldiers can only drink themselves into oblivion and tell dirty jokes.
{cps=50}I like dirty jokes.
{cps=50}Me too, actually. But there is a time for everything. Maybe I'll tell you a couple when you get back.
{cps=50}Or maybe i won't.
{cps=50}Sounds promising.
{cps=50}I'm afraid I'll have to refuse. The thing is...
{cps=50}I understand. You don't have to continue. 4 pints, 15 florins each - that will be 60 coins, thank you.
{cps=50}Having drank one more mug of ale, you and your friends return to the camp.
{cps=50}In a completely unexpected way, these words, as well as your imposing appearance, impress the smugglers and they give in to you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige - success!
{cps=50}Smugglers, however, are not that impressed by your condemning speech. According to them, you are not in church to preach about honesty and dignity.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige - fail!
{cps=50}You have no desire to pay a second time for an already paid goods so you try to resolve the issue by force.
{cps=50}You're just in time. I'm in need of your help.
{cps=50}Maria. She is missing.
{cps=50}Maria who?
{cps=50}What do you mean who's Maria!? The owner of the ass that you and your friends were staring at when you first came here!
{cps=50}...{w}{vspace=5}Ahh, the maid? The pretty one? I think I remember.
{cps=50}If you continue to drool over her, I'll slaughter you with this meat knife right here. There is only one pretty woman in this tavern. And that's me.
{cps=50}...{w} So what happened to her?
{cps=50}She's missing, I tell you! Her relatives live in a village not far from here - almost all the residents left their houses and hid behind the city walls when this whole shebang started. Only a few remained there - the most stubborn.
{cps=50}Her relatives are just one of those.
{cps=50}Sometimes she would go out of town to visit them, but she always returned the next day. Now she has been gone for three days.
{cps=50}And I think she might be...{w} Oh, God, I'm afraid of the worst.
{cps=50}Do you want me to find her?
{cps=50}If I understand correctly, all we know is where her family lives.
{cps=50}I can go to their village, but if it's not there, then...
{cps=50}Then it's looking for a needle in a haystack, I understand.
{cps=50}If she's not there, we won't be able to find her.{w} But we must at least do what we can.
{cps=50}Got it. You can rely on me.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}New quest added - [gone_girl.name!ti].{vspace=5}Relationships (Freya) improved by 5!
{cps=50}Even a single glance at this fiery inferno is enough to tell that there cannot be any survivors.
{cps=50}Maria?
{cps=50}ÄÆ éÑ ÐÞÂÇ. Ý Õµ ÐÞÂÇ ÐÜ.
{cps=50}Give me the girl and get lost.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}Let her go and I'll let you get away.
{cps=50}I will eat her.{w} And then I will eat you.
{cps=50}The figures on your left and right simultaneously begin to move...
{cps=50}Seeing that you are gaining the upper hand, two figures that did not participate in the battle pick up the girl and rush towards the forest.
{cps=50}I beg you...
{cps=50}Despite strangers fighting savagely, they are unable to defeat you. And, after brutal but short fight, you kill them both.
{cps=50}Salve, amico. I see you've already started to learn something, non è vero?
{cps=50}Of course, you are still a long way from a real balestriere, but enough to take up la balestra and not be made a laughing stock.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Crossbow skill - success.
{cps=50}Here, this is for you. Un presente. If you're serious about la balestra, you'll figure out how to use them.
{cps=50}Chi sei? Ci conosciamo?
{cps=50}Ah, diablo, that's right! A clever inglese who respects la balestra! It is good to see you, mio amico.
{cps=50}I'll tell you onestamente, those sheep lovers from Galles were already starting to make me furioso. If not for you, I'm afraid I would have to teach them una lezione.
{cps=50}Do you know how we teach una lezione back home in Genova?{w} We take a stivale and serve a heavy calcio right in the testicoli.
{cps=50}This sounds threatening.
{cps=50}Esattamente. The respected Duca forbids any combattimento between the soldato during the campagne, but cretina like those make my sangue boil.
{cps=50}I understand. I can't stand fools either.
{cps=50}Grande! I immediately realized that we were spiriti affini. I have an occhio on good people!
{cps=50}Quindi c'è quello. So you could say that you helped me not to get into guaio. And now I owe you a little.
{cps=50}If you want to learn how to use la balestra like a real balestriere italiano, come to me. I'll show you what's what.
{cps=50}Not gratuito, of course. But I won't make a price sky-high either. So keep in mind.
{cps=50}I'll tell you without further sciocchezze, ragazzo, you impressed me.
{cps=50}Learning to shoot la balestra is easy, but it takes many years to master it like un vero maestro. And you seem to grasp everything on the fly.
{cps=50}With such skills, it's time to acquire a proper strumento del mestiere.
{cps=50}One of our cameratas died in a recent battle, but I managed to save his arma. This is not your 'crossbow' inglese made of rotten wood with twine for a string. This is real un pezzo d'arte.
{cps=50}Ecco qua. Now it's yours. May it serve you better than my camerata.
{cps=50}Buona fortuna, balestriere.
{cps=50}Ah, ragazzino! How are you doing?
{cps=50}Looks like my training has paid off. I shot an enemy with a crossbow.
{cps=50}Molto bene. Keep up the good work.
{cps=50}Looks like my training has paid off. I killed an enemy with a head shot.
{cps=50}Looks like my training has paid off. I killed an enemy with a shot to the neck.
{cps=50}I've been practicing with the crossbow a lot in my spare time and I think I've learned a few things.
{cps=50}Veramente?{w} Bene, self-confidence is always ottimo, but the only one modo to test what you're really capable of...
{cps=50}...is to see how good you are on campo di battaglia. Target shooting is nothing, gioco da ragazzi! Anyone can do it.
{cps=50}But when real nemicos start falling dead from your bullone di balestra, that's another story.
{cps=50}Back in Genova, a real balestriere is one who can shoot a bullone right between the eyes from 100 paces. Or better yet, hit a nemico with a clean shot right in the throat!
{cps=50}We call it cravatta italiana.
{cps=50}Beautiful name.
{cps=50}Niente cazzate. Everything in Italia is beautiful. Hope Dio blesses you, and one day you will see for yourself.
{cps=50}But all that later. Now we have a war ahead of us.
{cps=50}So go ahead, amico. Show what you're worth.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest - [skill_check.name!ti].{vspace=5}New quest - [a_real_balestriere.name!ti].{vspace=5 }New quest - [cravatta_italiana.name!ti].
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}At the camp forge you can get full or partial repairs of your equipment. Partial repairs will cost less, but may lead to a worsening of some of the item's protective quolities. Only those items that are in your inventory can be repaired.
{cps=50}The job, according to him, is completely trifling - a matter of a couple of hours at maximum. All you need is to help him transport a small cargo from the military camp to the city.
{cps=50}Delighted by you agreeing to the job, he says that he will be waiting for you at the same place at sunset.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}New quest added - [contraband.name!ti]{vspace=5} Virtue lowered by 7!
{cps=50}Realizing that there is nothing you can do really, you put the bale on your back and, trying not to make any noise, cautiously start to make your way out of the camp.
{cps=50}You agree.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 5!
{cps=50}Lucky for you, your skills don't fail you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility - success!
{cps=50}But they all let you down.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Agility - fail!
{cps=50}You refuse, telling your comrades that after recent events you are done with crime.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 5!
{cps=50}However you fight fiercely and, thanks to your remarkable strength, are able turn the tide of the fight, forcing the mercenaries to flee.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength - success!
{cps=50}You fight fiercely, but the forces are painfully unequal and the fight ends with a complete trashing of the militiamen.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Strength - fail!
{cps=50}To the great surprise of some of your comrades, you join an ensuing fight on the side of the foreigners.
{cps=50}You reasonably choose not to get involved and save your ribs and nose.
{cps=50}In the evening, resting together with your comrades after another hard day, you, as usual, are looking for something to entertain yourself with.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}50 florins recieved.{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 3.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}45 florins recieved.{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 3.

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}[trait] florins lost!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 10.
{cps=50}One florin is not much, but it's all you have. Still you give the last coin in your pocket to the needy. 
{cps=50}With every passing day, overcrowded York becomes less and less peaceful.
{cps=50}The Scottish charge is slowing down and you have an opportunity to retreat...
{cps=50}For a few brief moments, you found yourself face to face with an eminent Templar.
{cps=50}For a few brief moments, you found yourself face to face with an eminent Templar. Giving you a good look, the knight, however, did not say anything to you, as if deciding that you are not worthy of his time.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue — fail!
{cps=50}Despite the sergeant being pretty straightforward with the fact that the man is not willing to cooperate and has to be tortured — you still decide to start with a more of a diplomatic approach.
{cps=50}And — much to your and your comrades' surprise — this works.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — success!
{cps=50}But this only makes the prisoner burst in laughter as he tells you that there's no way in hell he is ever going to be intimidated by a dirty semi-literate yokel like you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Prestige — fail!
{cps=50}Still trying to avoid getting involved in a full scale tortue, but understanding that force will definitely have to be used, you make a compromise and start with landing several punches and the prisoner's face.{w} Much to the cheers of the comrades.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!
{cps=50}Tightly tied he cannot do anything to you or even protect himself in any way.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue lowered by 10!
{cps=50}Refusing to take part in this dispicable atrocity makes you feel a little bit better about yourself.
{cps=50}According to various rumours, spreading around the camp, the Sheriff, who recently arrived in York, has already executed several criminals. Including two fugitives who were hiding among the militiamen.
{cps=50}Strolling around York's main square, you notice drawn portraits of various wanted criminals hanging on a wall of the city hall.

{cps=50}You are starting to get worried, but a couple of minutes later he draws your attention with a low whistle and, smiling, invites you with a gesture to the now open door.
{cps=50}The choice of weapons and equipment that awaits you inside turns out to be not very impressive, but it still looks very solid.
{cps=50}You try your best not to make noise, however, as it quickly becomes apparent, agility and grace are hardly your main virtues.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check failed!]
{cps=50}And what is even worse, this becomes obvious not only to you and your comrades but also to those from whom you would prefer to hide this fact about yourself.
{cps=50}The piercing creak of the boards immediately attracts the attention of several guards, who until that moment were peacefully snoring in one of the adjacent rooms.
{cps=50}At the risk of being cut off from your escape route, the four of you run away without saying a word.
{cps=50}A tactical retreat quickly turns into a stampede, and soon everyone is on their own.
{cps=50}In the chaos of the chase, you quickly go astray and get lost in the maze of tower passages, buzzing with loud voices and the stamping of many feet.
{cps=50}Only by sheer luck do you manage to get out and get back to the camp in a roundabout way.
{cps=50}Still not believing in your miraculous escape, you fall asleep.
{cps=50}In the morning, far from the most pleasant news awaits you - the whole camp is buzzing with rumors that this night a group of spies attacked the castle...
{cps=50}...no one knows what exactly they were trying to pull off, however, thanks to the vigilance of the guards, their dirty plans were thwarted.
{cps=50}Two bastards were hacked to death on the spot while resisting arrest, and another was captured alive.
{cps=50}Now, according to rumors, he is sitting in one of the castle dungeons and soon will get executed. If lucky, everyone will be able to see it before dispatch.
{cps=50}After such news, you can only shrug your shoulders.
{cps=50}{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - Jailbird.
{cps=50}Having picked up everything that you liked, you hastily embark on the return journey.
{cps=50}Luck seems to be smiling at you and the journey back goes without incident.
{cps=50}But suddenly, in the dark corridor, one of the doors opens before your nose...
{cps=50}...and you find yourself face to face with a guard emerging from there.
{cps=50}Hardly making out your outlines in the dark, he asks who is in front of him. You don't really know what to do now and glance at Bartholomew and his comrades, who have gone a little ahead. They are desperately signaling something to you with their hands, but you cannot distinguish their gestures in the dark.
{cps=50}The situation quickly becomes critical.
{cps=50}Realizing how desperate your situation is, you make a decision that seems to you to be the only right one and, gathering all your strength into a fist, land a sweeping hook to the jaw for the guard.
{cps=50}Perhaps from your epic strength, or perhaps simply from the sudden drowsiness, the guard falls to the ground like a bag, and you headlong rush to flee.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Strength check passed!]
{cps=50}Running for your dear life away from the tower, you cannot get rid of the feeling that they are already chasing you and you are about to be caught...
{cps=50}But when, after a few minutes, you finally find yourself outside by the ravine, you are surprised to realize that the silence around you at night is not disturbed by anything except your own heavy breathing.
{cps=50}Bartholomew pats you on the shoulder with a friendly grin, praising your determination. He also adds something about the 'good old days', but you don't quite understand what he is talking about.
{cps=50}Safely returning to the camp, you fall asleep, thinking about the adventures you have just experienced and realizing that you may have just made new good friends.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 5!{vspace=5}Bartholomew became your friend.
{cps=50}Despite the fact that you strike with all your strength, the punch turns out to be too weak and frankly unsuccessful.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Strength check failed!]
{cps=50}The guard instantly recovers from the attack, immediately grabs the sword hanging from his belt, and, loudly calling for help, begins to swing it left and right.
{cps=50}By some miracle, dodging his blows, you run away with all your might. Somewhere ahead of you, your comrades are also running in panic.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check passed!]
{cps=50}In the chaos of the chase, it becomes every man for himself and you quickly go astray and get lost in the maze of tower passages, buzzing with loud voices and the stamping of many feet.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - Jailbird.
{cps=50}{cps=50}Backing away from his blows, you stumble, and the blade of the sword reaches you, leaving a shallow but painful wound.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Agility check failed!]
{cps=50}Jumping up from the floor, you run away.
{cps=50}Pushing the guard away from you, you run with all your might, hoping to escape before he has time to overtake you.
{cps=50}Somewhere behind your back, wild cries of a guard are heard, alerting everyone around you of your presence.
{cps=50}As you wind through the twisted corridors, remembering your way back, the tower around you awakens. The silence and darkness that until recently filled its corridors and galleries are rapidly dissipating, giving way to the bright light of torches, loud voices, the clatter of feet and the clang of weapons.
{cps=50}For a while you manage to stay ahead of your pursuers, but in one of the corridors, literally a couple of turns before the exit, you are overtaken.
{cps=50}The night guard post located nearby becomes an unexpected obstacle on your way out...
{cps=50}Fate is on your side and you safely reach the camp.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check passed!]
{cps=50}But fate is not on your side and, when you try to escape, you get captured by the guards.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Luck check failed!]
{cps=50}Seizing a convenient moment when the guards are distracted by their own affairs, you run for your life. Thanks to the excellent shoes, you are able to gain a decent speed and easily cross the numerous ravines along the way, leaving your pursuers far behind and safely returning to camp.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check passed!]
{cps=50}You fish out the coin, that was so conveniently lying around in your pocket, and throw it on the opposite side of the street. The clinking sound it made successfully distracts the guards. While the alarmed French are busy looking for the source of the noise, you safely get out of the city and return to the camp.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check passed!]
{cps=50}You notice that the French regularly refill their flasks from a large barrel of water and mix the contents of the bottle of poison into it.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}[[Trinket check passed!]{vspace=5}Virtue decreased by 10!
{cps=50}Half an hour later, the guards fall to the ground, after which you safely get out of Cambrai and then reach the camp.
{cps=50}The unsuccessful outcome of the whole maneuver clearly upsets the prince and the earl, and they state that they expected much more from you.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 3!
{cps=50}However, on reflection, both agree that there were some certain flaws in the plan.
{cps=50}Despite the partial failure of the operation, you still managed to get a certain amount of information, for which you receive gratitude from the command.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) improved by 6!{vspace=5}+30 Florins!
{cps=50}However, the limited amount of information, as well as the unsuccessful outcome of the whole maneuver, clearly upset the prince and the earl and they state that they expected much more from you.
{cps=50}The earl and the prince take your success for granted, attributing it entirely to the ingenuity of their plan.
{cps=50}However, you also get a certain praise.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) improved by 10!{vspace=5}+55 Florins!
{cps=50}You dragged on with the preparations too much and failed to fulfill the order of the earl and the prince to infiltrate the city under the guise of a monk in time, which seriously disappointed both of them.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (the earl) lowered by 20!
{cps=50}Shortly after the start of the siege, the camp starts to experience small supply disruptions.{w} As you find out, the cause is in the wagons coming from Dunkirk that got stuck due to the roads being washed out by the rain.
{cps=50}The King doesn't want to risk the morale and combat effectiveness of the army, and gives the order to outfit detachments of foragers, that will go to the surrounding settlements to collect food.
{cps=50}Having distinguished yourself during the recent battles in Cambrai and being already acquainted with the earl, you are placed in charge of one of these small detachments.
{cps=50}Thanks to your authority among the soldiers, you are put at the head of one of these small detachments.
{cps=50}The sergeant gives you a map of the area, on which several nearby villages are marked - places, that you have to visit.
{cps=50}While instructing you, the sergeant urges you not to show excessive aggression towards the local residents, but also not to babysit them either - the soldiers need something to eat and the peasants will have to share, whether they want to or not.
{cps=50}Also, according to him, you should always keep your ears open when communicating with the villagers. It is not for nothing that an old English proverb says - 'In the woods there are fancy-ass pheasants, in the mud huts there are dirty-ass peasants'...{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Quest added - [forager.name].
{cps=50}After about a two-hour journey, you reach a settlement called Barfleur, located west of Cambrai.
{cps=50}The village looks frankly poor and one of your companions immediately says that peasants here probably don't have anything even for themselves.
{cps=50}The peasants you come across on the way look tattered and intimidated and do not at all resemble wealthy people you could take something from.
{cps=50}Taking a good look around, you find the village headman, whose words only confirm your observations - there is nothing to take in Barfleur because the locals themselves can hardly make ends meet.
{cps=50}Despite the protests and pleas of the headman, as well as of the other villagers, you, one after another, ravage all the village houses and sheds, stuffing bales with food.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue decreased by 10!
{cps=50}You leave the village to the accompaniment of the crying and howling of dozens of women and children. One of the soldiers riding next to you mutters in an undertone that, although orders are orders, you did not act like a Christian.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) decreased by 2!
{cps=50}Not wanting to bleed the people dry, but at the same time, not daring to disobey the royal order, you try to find a compromise and offer the villagers to sell their food to you.
{cps=50}Of course, there is no talk about buying at a market price, but at least some kind of compensation will clearly be better than nothing and at least will allow them not to starve to death.
{cps=50}After a little thought, the headman asks for 50 florins.
{cps=50}You pay the peasants out of your own pocket and fill bales and sacks with what little you are able to find.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Gold decreased by 50!{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 15!
{cps=50}On the way back, you overhear the conversation of two soldiers, calling you a good Christian and thanking you for not making them take the last crumbs from people.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 3!
{cps=50}You decide to pay, but it turns out that you don't have such money...
{cps=50}You are quite annoyed by the prospect of paying the entire amount out of your own pocket and you offer the rest of the soldiers to chip in.
{cps=50}Since you do not have the money to pay the entire amount out of your own pocket, you offer the rest of the soldiers to chip in.
{cps=50}You pay the peasants and fill bales and sacks with what little you are able to find.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}None of the soldiers are delighted with such an idea. You try to convince them, but your authority is clearly not enough.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}[[Reputation check failed!]
{cps=50}Seeing no way to get out of this situation, you cannot come up with anything better than to simply give the order to go back. The sergeant, the earl, and even the King himself may demand anything they want from you, but you would never take people's last crumbs.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}On the way to camp, you can't help but think that this was the first time you were trusted with a really serious matter... and you didn’t handle it.{w} You try not to think about how unpleasant the conversation with the sergeant, who is now waiting at camp, is going to be.
{cps=50}Heading east from the camp, you soon arrive at a large village called Fer-à-Cheval.

{cps=50}An untidy-looking armed man with a bundle of brushwood emerges on the opposite side of the clearing. His clothes, smeared with mud, are torn and frayed by tree branches. However, some of the heraldic symbols on them are still visible... and they seem suspiciously familiar to you.
{cps=50}You are willing to swear that you are looking at a deserter.
{cps=50}Upon seeing you, the stranger immediately draws his weapon and rushes in your direction.
{cps=50}Not wanting to shed blood in vain, you try to reason with the deserter and convince him that you do not pose a threat to him.
{cps=50}He, however, only laughs at your words. Noting that you definitely do not pose a threat to him, because you do not even have your armor on. And therefore, it will be much simpler for him to dispose of you than to risk leaving you alive.
{cps=50}Your words make him think. By the facial expressions and demeanor of the deserter, you sense that he is in a desperate situation, and letting you go will put him in no less jeopardy than if he were to face you in combat.
{cps=50}After a little hesitation, he nevertheless agrees to confide in you, making you give him your word that you won't give out his whereabouts to anyone.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check passed!
{cps=50}He contemplates your words for a second... However, he quickly casts his doubts aside, stating that he cannot trust you, and you will certainly snitch on him.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue check failed!
{cps=50}The way back is uneventful at first.{w} However, with each new step, it becomes more difficult for you to shake off the feeling that someone is watching you.
{cps=50}Several very suspicious fellas suddenly block your way.
{cps=50}At first you mistake them for ordinary robbers, but quickly realize that something is very wrong with them.
{cps=50}As if in confirmation of these thoughts, strangers, without even voicing their demands, draw their weapons...

{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Welcome to Нeads Will Roll — Downfall!{vspace=25}Soon you will embark on your first adventure, but before you do it - we have to warn you: not all risks are worth taking and not all fights are worth fighting.{vspace=5}Blindly charging forward without considering the circumstances and consequences is the fastest way to get yourself killed.
{cps=50}You have received monthly pay according to your rank.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+[attackchance] Florins!{/color}{vspace=5}You have received an additional payment for your Prestige level.{vspace=5}{color=#A9A9A9}+[trait] Florins!
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Tutorial: Armor{vspace=5} Your character has 5 different armor slots that allow you to wear 5 different armor pieces at the same time.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}First of all there is a body armor slot for various big armor pieces — gambesons, chainmails, plates, etc. Body armor usually offers the biggest amount of protection and sometimes can cover not only your torso but also your limbs and neck. It also, however, can apply a lot of penalties to your attributes.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Second big one is the helmet slot — for various helmets and head protection items. In battle, the head is harder to hit than the torso, but the blows, received to the head, do more damage and can inflict particularly nasty injuries. So it would be wise to keep your head safe.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}There are also three additional armor slots: gorget slot (for items that protect neck and throat), bracer slot, and leg armor slot (both for items that protect limbs).{vspace=5}Neck is very hard to hit, but strikes to the neck do the most damage and sometimes can cut the throat causing massive bleedings.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Limbs, on the other hand, have the lowest damage modifier out of all body zones, but every successful strike to the limbs builds up the fatigue. On top of that, injuries to arms and legs greatly diminish your weapon skill and agility which are responsible for your attack and defense. Thus, even though the limbs seem like the least vital body part, they definitely are not the least important.
{cps=50}The effectiveness of repairing a mechanical drum depends on your Craftsmanship skill. Each repair attempt will consume some of your time.{vspace=5}It is only possible to conduct repairs while in camp.
{cps=50}Being the youngest son of an impoverished merchant, you never had any particular ambitions about your future. And never in your wildest dreams had you imagined yourself becoming a warrior.
{cps=50}Living a poor but steady life you, from a young age, found solace in hard and honest physical labour. Never asking for much, you were happy to spend your days working and evenings partying with friends at a local tavern — letting wine and ale wash away the sweat.
{cps=50}It was one of these evenings that turned your whole world upside down.
{cps=50}Drunken brawls at the tavern were not uncommon — especially when the place was visited by some fancy-dressed outsiders with fat purses and bad manners. The locals didn't take kindly to this kind of strangers.
{cps=50}That night it was the Sheriff's youngest son with his buddies who showed up at the tavern. Loud, haughty and full of his usual obnoxious swagger, he immidiately started to boast about how he and his family own all of Greenwich; telling stories about riches of his father and countless men killed by his older brother — a bloodthirsty duelist.
{cps=50}They were almost openly asking for an ass-whooping. This time, however, it didn't end with a simple fistfight. Things escalated and soon after first hands were thrown people started reaching for clubs and knives.
{cps=50}You reached for yours too.{w}{vspace=5}It was not really clear who had landed the blow that killed the Sheriff's son. But it were you who had to pay for it.
{cps=50}A couple of hours later that same night armed people dragged you out of your own house, throwing you into Greenwich jail. The Sheriff paid you a personal visit and — after a rather brief half-hour beating — promised you that you'd be hanged by the next noon.
{cps=50}At dawn, using the carelessness of the sleepy guards who were taking you to see the judge, you escaped.
{cps=50}A day later — hungry and dirty — you arrived in London. With no idea where to go, you came across a wagon of royal recruiters, agitating local beggars and drunkards to join militia of the king's army that was about to set out north — to wage war against the invading Scots.
{cps=50}Finding yourself in the middle of a strange city with no friends or money but with a hefty bounty on your head, you didn't really had much of a choice.{w} If you had to lose your life — you'd rather die by a sword or an arrow than from a shameful noose around the neck.
{cps=50}A couple of hours later you entered a large military encampment on the northern end of the city.
{cps=50}Ruffin was right and precisely one week after you appeared in the camp the army set out north.
{cps=50}The days of waiting and constant nervous excitement were finally over and, for the first time in a very long while, you caught yourself actually being hopeful about the future.
{cps=50}Seeing this picture unfold, the Scots, who didn't risk tasting the wine first, join in.
{cps=50}With everybody now partaking in this improvised feast you too decide to snatch some wine for yourself. But once the filled cup only so much as touches your lips Ruffin suddenly — surreptitiously but very firmly —  pokes you with an elbow.
{cps=50}'Don't even think about drinking this shit', — he says in an undertone while trying to make sure noone hears this conversation. 'Pretend that you do but don't swallow a drop'.
{cps=50}Guessing by his weird behaviour that this is no time for asking questions you silently oblige. And, for the next half an hour, diligently pretend to take a sip every now and then.
{cps=50}It doesn't take long for it to become clear what exactly did Ruffin save you from. All of a sudden everybody around you starts grabbing their throats while making weird, almost a deathrattle like, noises.{w} The grimaces of pain distort the faces of both your comrades and the Scots.
{cps=50}The only two men left untouched by this are, of course, Ruffin and you.
{cps=50}And just as you start to finally get an idea of what was going on the events begin unfolding at an even quicker pace. The doors of the main hall are pushed wide open and two heavily armed English soldiers rush in. Taking it as a sign Ruffin immediately draws his weapon and all three of them charge at the barely standing Scots.
{cps=50}The fight barely lasts a minute. Poisoned and choking with their own blood, the Scots can barely move and are easily killed.
{cps=50}You comrades, however, are hardly in any better position as some of them are lying on the ground, convulsing and making horrible noises. While others don't even move.
{cps=50}You think about helping them but one glance is enough to understand that it might be a little too late to administer first aid.{w} On top of that, nobody except you seems to even have a semblance of interest in their fate: after dealing with the bodyguards and making sure their throats are slit, Ruffin and the soldiers kick down the door to the negotiations chamber, ignoring everything else.
{cps=50}Not having much of choice you follow them.
{cps=50}Seeing that you're having troubles with your opponent, the sergeant sends another soldier to help you out.
{cps=50}The Scots try to resist but, affected by the poison, they obviously don't stand much of a chance and very soon all their negotiation party is butchered.
{cps=50}Keeping silent you patiently wait for either the earl or Ruffin to speak, hoping to finally get at least some sort of an explaination for all the madness that you've just witnessed. But neither of them deems you worthy of a clarification.
{cps=50}Through the open windows you hear sounds of another battle raging somewhere in the courtyard. The earl immediately orders you and Ruffin to go out there and help the sergeant and his men who are fighting the Scots outside.
{cps=50}In the courtyard there's a full scale battle going on as the rest of the Scots — untouched by poison and still very numerous — are trying to fight their way out of the manor. The sergeant with about a dozen of his men is blocking their way.
{cps=50}Ruffin enters the battle without hesitation.
{cps=50}You too join in right away.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 5!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 7!
{cps=50}You're borderline exhausted and decide to not take unnecessary chances fighting against fresh and well-armed enemies. So you prefer to hang back.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue lowered by 10!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) lowered by 10!
{cps=50}Perhaps your passivity turns out to be the deciding factor as, after a short but bloody battle, the Scots manage to break through the English forces and successfully retreat from the manor.
{cps=50}This small victory, however, barely changes something in the grand scheme of things that have unfolded. All the Scottish leaders who've showed up for the negotiations are still dead leaving the invading army seemingly all but completely decapitated.
{cps=50}With nobody eager to voluntarily provide you any answers you decide that maybe it was time you started to demand some...
{cps=50}Despite all of your efforts the Scots still manage to break through and successfully retreat.
{cps=50}Still hoping to catch them, the sergeant orders a pursuit.
{cps=50}Ignoring wounds and fatigue you join the chase.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 2!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 2!
{cps=50}Ignoring fatigue you join the chase.{color=#A9A9A9}{vspace=5}Virtue increased by 2!{vspace=5}Reputation (soldiers) increased by 2!
{cps=50}Back when you were still fighting in the courtyard of the manor, you noticed that one of the enemies blew his hunting horn making its thundering sounds roll all around the area.
{cps=50}The help that he was obviously asking for is not taking long to arrive. As the retreating Scots are heading towards a nearby grove, crossbowmen suddenly appear from the cover of the trees and bolts immediately start flying everywhere around you.
{cps=50}There have to be some pretty good shots on the enemy side as the first volley hits sevral targets right away. One of the men who fall to the ground is the sergeant.
{cps=50}Tables are turning fast and the predators are becoming the prey. Seeing that now it's them who have the advantage the Scots, reinforced by the crossbowmen, turn around and attack you.
{cps=50}Completely and thoroughly exhausted you cannot muster any energy to chase the retreating Scots preferring to stay back at the manor.
{cps=50}With herculean efforts you somehow manage to hold your ground. Unwilling to waste too much time on you and wary of coming English reinforcements, the Scots retreat to the grove and disappear.
{cps=50}The sergeant, much to his fortune, despite being hit with two shots ends up alive. One of the bolts recocheted from his gorget and the other struck him in the knee causing a painful but nonleathal wound.
{cps=50}Many others however did not fare that well: during the short battle the crossbowmen mowed down a lot of soldiers making some of them look like literal hedgehogs with dozens of bolts poking out of their bodies. This grim picture saddens you... And you begin frowning even harder when you remember the distorted faces of your poisoned comrades back at the manor.
{cps=50}If all of this was indeed someone's plan then it'd better been worth it.
{cps=50}The next few days pass in a relative calmness. But only in a relative one as, despite the recent success, the news and rumours that are coming to the English camp paint an increasingly grimer picture.
{cps=50}Even though pretty much decapitated, the invading army not only didn't scatter around but rather continued to grow in size. Primarily thanks to French reinforcements arriving pretty much daily.
{cps=50}Very soon everyone in the camp comes to understand the much dreaded second pitched battle — that the English command tried so hard to avoid — is at this point inevitable.
{cps=50}Thus, about a week after the bloody 'negotiations' that were supposed to put an end to the whole campaign, both armies met each other at the same precise positions as before — on the hills near the city. The English, once again, in the safety of their field fortifications and the Scots, once again, right in front of them — ready to attack.

{cps=50}A breakout of yet another war between England and France was barely a surprise to anyone. The rivalry between the two kingdoms has lasted for more than a century, and small but regular armed conflicts have become commonplace for them. This war seemed to many to be an ordinary event, but the English king had other plans.{vspace=75}{color=#A9A9A9}Hold CTRL to skip text.
{cps=50}This time he had no interest in lesser goals and aimed as high as to ascend to the throne of France itself, using its ongoing dynasty crisis as a casus belli.
{cps=50}War preparations started by Edward III have surpassed any of his past military campaigns. Understanding the scope of his ambitions, the king of England did not delude himself. The war that he was about to embark on was going to be the greatest in history. And for an undertaking like that a proper army was in order.
{cps=50}The core of his forces, as it has always been, was constituted by the best of England's chivalry — eagerly awaiting their chance to finally outshine the French chevaliers and claim the laurels of the best in the world.
{cps=50}Struck down by an enemy blow, Bartholomew slowly sinks to the ground. One look at him is enough to immediately understand that he's not going to make it.
{cps=50}Leaning towards the dying man, you try to hear his last request addressed to you... but can no longer make out the words.
{cps=50}Giving you one last look in the eyes, Bartholomew breathes his last breath.
{cps=50}The course of the battle gradually changes. The confident onslaught of the English, which allowed you to take over a large section of the wall, is now slowly but surely fizzling out.
{cps=50}The French on the other hand, thanks to the constant flow of reinforcements, begin to push even harder, threatening to throw you off the wall very soon.
{cps=50}Right in the heart of battle you spot a tall knight leading and cheering the French soldiers.{w} Confidently wielding his halberd, he fights with such fury, as if he intends to win the battle just by himself.
{cps=50}Several of your comrades rush at him, but one by one they all fall dead from his heavy blows.
{cps=50}Despite the fatigue and exhaustion, you remain clear-minded and are able to see that this is the exact moment that might decide the fate of the whole assault.
{cps=50}The French, just like you, are standing on their last legs, and the death of the knight leading the defense cannot but topple their ranks.
{cps=50}With these thoughts in mind you take a step forward...
{cps=50}Despite the fatigue and exhaustion, you remain clear-minded and see that you're no match for a foe like that.
{cps=50}Especially after everything that you have been through today.
{cps=50}Seeing victory slip out of hands, your allies begin to pull back. Those closer to the ladders and siege towers hurriedly descend, while others are trying to slow down the French advance and cover the retreat.
{cps=50}{color=#A9A9A9}Virtue increased by 10!
{cps=50}You bravely join those few remaining soldiers who continue to fight, and with combined efforts you win a little bit of time for the retreating.

{cps=50}The air in the camp fills with tension as the English army is getting on for the second decisive assault. The initial plan of a lightning-fast campaign and fast advance into the French territory, as envisioned by the King, is not just at risk, it is about to come apart at the seams. Any delay can result in incalculable risks.
{cps=50}Reports from the farthest sentries indicate that the French King Jean II is already pulling in troops from all across his realms to the borders of the province. That means thousands of knights, including the very best of the French chevaliers.
{cps=50}Lingering at Cambrai for one more week would pretty much spell doom for the English army that will find itself stuck between a rock and a hard place — with impenetrable city walls on one side and French King's ironclad heavy cavalry on the other.
{cps=50}Seeking to delay the advance of the French troops and buy more time for another decisive offensive, King Edward allocates about a quarter of his troops to Thomas Marshall, a prominent English commander, to intercept and set back Jean's approaching forces, not yet joint together into one unstoppable army.
{cps=50}This bold move leaves no doubt that the events of the several upcoming days will decide the fate of the campaign.
{cps=50}The tension quickly spreads from lords and knights to sergeants and mere soldiers. And, when the time for the assault comes, the whole army is on edge, with every last man understanding the weight of the situation.
{cps=50}Learning their lesson from the previous failed attempts to storm the city, the English begin the assault by barraging the walls from all the available siege engines.
{cps=50}This time, however, this barrage is not chaotic and is only aimed at the several spots considered to be the weakest.
{cps=50}Tattered by the siege, the fortifications can barely withstand the onslaught. Soon several fragments of the walls start to crumble, creating gaps in what previously seemed to be an impenetrable defense.
{cps=50}The southern wall, which has suffered some of the most devastating blows, collapses almost by a quarter, creating a way into the city. Observing this, the King declares that section as the main attack direction and orders the infantry to advance.

{cps=50}All right, you, look here. I need these six prisoners — they are coming with me.
{cps=50}Where to? It's none of your damn business!
{cps=50}Now, get in line!
{cps=50}Listen up. I'm here to make you all a rare generous offer.
{cps=50}According to the documents I have, before you donned the shameful prisoner robes, all of you had time to participate in wars. Some were even in more than one.
{cps=50}It just so happens that the kingdom needs your services again. Needs them so much, in fact, that the London Parliament, on the wise and urgent advice of Count Canterbury, decided to grant you a pardon...
{cps=50}If you are ready to take up arms again, stand under our banners, and faithfully serve until the need for it disappears.
{cps=50}I'm taking those who agree to accept this generous offer with me right now.
{cps=50}And those who disagree may go back to their date with that gentleman with an axe over there.
{cps=50}Those willing, step forward!
